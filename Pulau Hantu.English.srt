1
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Good evening.

2
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,599
Sorry to keep you waiting.

3
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
You okay?

4
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,080
They didn't even let you clean up?

5
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,360
Sorry guys, can you get us some…

6
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Actually you know what?

7
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,039
Do you mind if we do this first?

8
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,520
It‘s not going to take long, you know?

9
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,319
Then we can let you get out of here.

10
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,199
I'll take that as a yes.

11
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,080
Hungry?

12
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,159
Thirsty?

13
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,919
So, let's see.

14
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,599
Your section went out there to

15
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,960
locate some AWOL soldiers.

16
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,360
And now those soldiers
from your section are missing.

17
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What happened?

18
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
You know,

19
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,240
there are some people out there

20
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,879
who believe that you are responsible.

21
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,639
They want to make this your screw up.

22
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,319
Listen,

23
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm your only friend.

24
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,399
Trust me.

25
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,240
Hello.

26
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,319
Yes, sir.

27
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,199
Okay, I'll be right in.

28
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,600
Can I just know what the…

29
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,560
There you are.

30
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,800
I've been here all along.

31
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,199
I want to ask you a question.

32
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,839
When you called me up
and said "Come back to town,

33
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,920
"because there's a big family emergency,"

34
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,360
was it really because it was an AGM?

35
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Because now that I'm back in this country,

36
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,160
the Army knows I'm back,

37
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,680
and they want me to do
a two-week reservist.

38
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,040
I'm not too happy about it.

39
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,560
So? It's just two weeks.

40
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,600
If you can't survive that,

41
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,920
how are you going to take over

42
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,800
Heng Technologies from me one day?

43
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,399
I don't want to take over
Heng Technologies from you one day.

44
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Do I want your money?
Do I take your money?

45
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,480
Listen,

46
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,639
you can stop hiding in London,

47
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,839
stop running away
from your responsibilities.

48
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,399
Now come over and join us.

49
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Sorry about that.

50
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,360
To the Army.

51
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,199
History teaches us many, many, many,

52
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,639
many, many great things.

53
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,920
But the problem is,

54
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,439
are we willing to learn?

55
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
And you.

56
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,079
Twice in a week,

57
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,480
still never learn your lesson.

58
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,439
Now if you want this back…

59
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,040
Sir, class is already over.

60
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,600
James, I thought this was our weekend.

61
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,120
My name's Alvin,

62
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
and just one call
and then no distractions, alright?

63
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Hello?

64
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Yeah.

65
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Yup.

66
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,839
I'm busy, okay?

67
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,920
Who's that?

68
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,959
My wife.

69
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,360
So, do you want to buy this flat?

70
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay, James.

71
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:41,920
Alvin!

72
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,160
What's this?

73
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,639
They won't suspect anything.

74
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,559
That's right.

75
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,279
Been a long time, June.

76
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,200
How's playing soldier
been working out for you?

77
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,320
I see you're in good form. You look great.

78
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,679
Sir, I wouldn't sweat it.

79
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,519
I hear she likes the strong,
silent, ugly type?

80
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,679
Sort of like, you know, Benicio del Toro.

81
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,159
So…

82
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
I don't have a chance?

83
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
But Rajah does.

84
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,519
What's so funny?

85
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,159
I don’t know.

86
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,519
You laughed so I laughed.

87
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,679
It's good to be back.

88
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,519
Not.

89
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,279
Corporal.

90
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Alright.

91
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,960
Welcome to Pulau Hantu.

92
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,960
Home of insects, reptiles, coconut trees…

93
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,120
and AWOL soldiers.

94
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,720
AWOL?

95
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,559
No wonder they were
so secretive about the mission.

96
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,519
Three soldiers presumed AWOL in this area.

97
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,159
HQ hasn't heard from them in two days.

98
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,679
Charlie Company Second Infantry Battalion,
Section Seven.

99
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,159
Lieutenant Terence Teo,

100
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,840
Lance Corporal William DeSouza,

101
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,080
and Corporal Suppaiah.

102
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,159
Why would anyone go AWOL?

103
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,600
It's not like we're at war, right?

104
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,440
Now Singapore Army is very simple

105
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,960
yet they want to go AWOL.

106
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,879
Horrible.

107
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,240
Last time my army days
were really difficult, you know?

108
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,480
I had to iron my number
three uniform every day,

109
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,480
polish the boots until they were shiny,

110
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,480
even the vegetables had stones in them.

111
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,519
Wow. Many, many words.

112
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,480
These men are armed with live rounds.

113
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,200
Sir,

114
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,480
I have checked already.

115
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,840
This island has no humans

116
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,519
but has a lot of mosquitoes.

117
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,399
Alright guys,

118
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,679
we rendezvous back here
at two o'clock with Sgt. Han.

119
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,759
Yes, sir.

120
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,120
It’s 1400 hours. Not two o’clock, sir.

121
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,279
Two a.m. or 2 p.m. What do you all want?

122
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,080
Two p.m., sir.

123
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,200
2pm sounds good.

124
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,440
Raj,

125
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,600
Alvin, Frankie.

126
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,840
That way.
Hadi, follow me.

127
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,519
Wait, wait.

128
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,360
Hey.
How come I have to shave my head

129
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,399
and this Lt. Heng
can have hair like a girl?

130
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,799
You rich?

131
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,799
Nope.

132
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:54,919
You got connections?

133
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
No.

134
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,759
You mean Daddy didn't save you from
going to reservist for 12 years?

135
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,039
Hell, no.

136
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,039
Which is why you look like G.I. Jane

137
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,960
and that clown looks like Malibu Barbie.

138
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,879
That's not fair.

139
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,120
He’s fair what.

140
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,240
Last time his skin was dark.

141
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,480
Now it's very white,

142
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,559
like a Caucasian.

143
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,159
He talks with a slang too.

144
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,799
Better than that woman

145
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,200
who pretends to be like a soldier.

146
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,919
I think if she sees a lizard…

147
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,960
Mummy, daddy!

148
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,039
Up, up. Hey, let's go!

149
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,720
You done?

150
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:28,799
Yeah.

151
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,399
Wow.

152
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,159
Rajah,
you normally don't talk

153
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,000
but when you do, there's power.

154
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,240
Steady, Rajah.

155
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,440
Soldier, on your feet!

156
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,919
There are oil refineries right here.

157
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,039
Major shipping lines.

158
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,080
These guys are a security threat.

159
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,879
June.

160
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Chill.

161
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,519
Sergeant?

162
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,639
Are we good?

163
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,799
Is there anything else?
Are we fine?

164
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,440
Because if we are, can we please move?

165
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,360
Because I don't feel good…

166
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,559
Why? You're scared?

167
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,600
Guys,

168
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,720
this place is called
Pulau Hantu for a reason.

169
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,879
Pulau Hantu.

170
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,440
"Hantu" is ghost in Malay.

171
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,080
Look, there aren't
any ghosts on this island.

172
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,559
-It's just a name.
-How do you know?

173
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,559
Because my company
just had a barbecue here.

174
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,240
Cheap bastards couldn't even afford
to pay for a proper restaurant.

175
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,200
There are two innocent spirits
on this island.

176
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,399
A mother and a daughter seeking revenge.

177
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,519
How come every forest we go to,

178
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,799
you have to come up
with another ghost story?

179
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,159
Alvin,

180
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,399
my father's batch, some 40 years ago,

181
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,559
they heard the same story.

182
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,759
Two NS men went missing
somewhere near this island.

183
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,240
Okay, I also heard the same story.

184
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,279
They never found those guys, right?

185
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Alright.

186
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,159
There's nothing here. Alright?

187
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,279
We're done. Let's go.

188
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,000
Sir, I love it that you're back.

189
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,840
Kiss my ass over a beer later.

190
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,039
It's just a scratch.

191
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,639
Permission to fire, sir!

192
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
What do we do, sir?

193
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,679
Permission to fire, sir!

194
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,320
Sir!

195
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Load and ready!

196
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,919
Alvin, Frankie. Left.

197
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Rajah, cover me.

198
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,360
Go, go, go!

199
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
Why are they shooting?

200
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,399
Sir, you're bleeding.

201
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,600
-Do you need help?
-Shut up and stay alert.

202
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,919
They could be anywhere.

203
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,559
You guys covered this area.
You didn't see them?

204
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
We checked.

205
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,399
Kind of…

206
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,519
Let's go.

207
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Hey,

208
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,759
hey!

209
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's safer here.

210
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,360
Don't try to be a hero.

211
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
I said let's go!

212
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,399
Hey!

213
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Why?

214
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,799
What did you see?

215
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,839
Don't be scared.
It's only a mountain chicken.

216
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,799
What's this?

217
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,880
Guys!

218
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Guys, please.

219
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,759
Do not touch anything!

220
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:53,839
This is a burial site.

221
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,039
Please respect this place.

222
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,519
Don't get distracted. Let's move.

223
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,519
Looks like this must be what the
AWOL soldiers were after.

224
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,680
Yo.
Why did you bring that?

225
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,799
Think we're going on parade, is it?

226
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Alvin,

227
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,799
this emblem here,

228
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,799
this one,

229
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,200
it's been blessed by
seven different religions.

230
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,279
It's for protection.

231
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:16,799
Who knows?

232
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,079
It may just save our lives.

233
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Understand?

234
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,960
Frankie, Frankie.

235
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,640
Frankie, please.
Frankie, please.

236
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,799
Frankie, please don't take anything
that doesn't belong to you,

237
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,720
Frankie please.

238
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,680
This is a ritual,
where the more evil the spirits,

239
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,759
the more things they put to cover.

240
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,240
Rajah,

241
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,279
how to say ghost in Hokkien?

242
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,319
"Gui."

243
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,720
Frankie, this one got…

244
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,000
Downstairs got "ghost".

245
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,839
This one put to cover the "ghost" from…

246
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,079
You are the "ghost" right?

247
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,119
Sir,

248
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,359
help me, sir.

249
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Help me on this.

250
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,480
DeSouza, Teo and Suppaiah
could be anywhere.

251
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,559
Stay alert.

252
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,559
Believe me or don't believe me,
I don't care.

253
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,400
But the spirits here are innocent.
If we don't disturb them--

254
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,519
Hadi, drop it!

255
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
This must mean something.

256
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,480
Of course it means something.

257
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,039
The question is, what?

258
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,599
Please stop.

259
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,440
No more.

260
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,519
Corporal DeSouza,

261
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,440
-Corporal DeSouza! Do you hear me?
-I'm sorry.

262
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,400
-I'm sorry.
-Stand down.

263
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,640
I said stand down!
You're already in a lot of trouble.

264
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Don't make things worse!

265
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,799
He could be leading us to a trap.

266
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,000
Waiting for an invitation?

267
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Come on.

268
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,319
We are all going to die!

269
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Relax, relax.

270
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:05,480
Give me my gun.
I give you this one to protect yourself.

271
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,319
It won't protect you.
Nothing will.

272
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,680
We're here to help.

273
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,359
We're going to die. Just like my men.

274
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
We have a boat, okay?

275
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,680
We're here to get you.

276
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,599
A boat?

277
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,440
Yeah. We have a boat.

278
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,039
We can leave?

279
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,240
Yeah.

280
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,319
We can leave?

281
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,880
I'll kill you!

282
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Frankie!

283
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,359
It's evil.

284
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
This place.

285
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
You don't know.

286
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,039
You want?

287
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,839
-Want some water?
-Yeah.

288
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,880
What don't I know?

289
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,759
This place.

290
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,799
You don't know this place.

291
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Where's Teo?

292
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,960
Suppaiah? Where are they?

293
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
We got to go.

294
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:05,240
-We got to go now. Now.
-Where's the boat? The boat.

295
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,599
-Relax.
-The boat. We got to go.

296
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,519
The boat!

297
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,519
Come on. We got to go.

298
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,960
-Alright, Frankie.
-Go back.

299
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,000
-Go.
-Hang on, let me pick up my gun.

300
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,279
Wait.

301
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,960
I can sell this for a lot of money.

302
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,319
Shit.

303
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,240
Frankie. Frankie!

304
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Shit.

305
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
What did you do?

306
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
He didn't do anything!

307
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,799
We need a medic. Radio Sgt. Han.

308
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,160
Two-niner, two-niner. Acknowledge? Over.

309
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,119
Acknowledge? Over.

310
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,559
Shit. Comms not working.

311
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,039
Shit!

312
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,160
What the hell is going on?

313
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,319
Goddammit.

314
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
What's going on?

315
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,000
Check your phones!

316
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,200
No signal!

317
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,880
What the hell is going on?

318
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,440
I'm not staying to find out.

319
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,720
Get Frankie down.

320
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,119
No. We have to leave this place.

321
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,640
Now! Come on, guys.

322
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,160
Now! Leave this place.

323
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,200
Come on!

324
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,519
Wait, wait. Stop!

325
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,359
This is the wrong way.

326
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,920
Shit, something's not right.

327
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,720
Keep moving to shore.

328
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,680
Sir, we're running around blindly.

329
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:25,759
We need a plan.

330
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,920
The plan is keep moving to shore.

331
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,119
Yeah. Let's go.
Let's get off this island.

332
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,160
How? Where? Which way?

333
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,400
We should hide.

334
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,680
-We're not hiding.
-Hiding from what?

335
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,720
Teo and Suppaiah are still here. Armed.

336
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,200
Woman, is your bra on too tight?

337
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,279
After what's happened,
you're still thinking about those guys?

338
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,319
Shut up before I twist your balls off!

339
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,880
Can you sit? You're making me nervous.

340
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,319
Told you not to touch anything…

341
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,400
Not to touch anything…

342
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,079
You guys think I talk rubbish.

343
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,440
Just don't listen.

344
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,519
You see what happened?

345
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,599
I thought my students are bad.

346
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
You guys are worse.

347
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:12,880
-You know you guys are a…
-Just a storm, bro.

348
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,000
It's just a storm.

349
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,920
-Where are you going?
-Take a dump. You want to help?

350
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,880
-Now?
-You want to go now?

351
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,279
I don't control the flow, bro.

352
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,880
Do you think this is what happened
to those missing soldiers?

353
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,279
Back in the seventies?

354
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,200
You know,

355
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,519
I shouldn't even be here.

356
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:41,279
I should have gotten
an excuse from reservist.

357
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,960
I should have broken my hand

358
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,240
or maybe even my leg.

359
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,559
You know what?
My wife said that we should go overseas.

360
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,599
She said we should go to…

361
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,400
What the hell man?! Rajah!

362
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Sir,

363
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,319
Teo, Suppaiah, DeSouza are career soldiers

364
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,960
with no disciplinary actions.

365
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,559
So why would they do this?

366
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,200
Who knows and who cares?

367
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,839
Right now,
our best option is to get off this island.

368
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,039
But I don't understand.

369
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,440
Why would they go AWOL?

370
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,759
I don't know.

371
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,240
Maybe they were secretly disgruntled.

372
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,279
Like you.

373
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,039
But at least
I'm not Daddy's little White Horse, sir.

374
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,359
Trust me. I'm anything but a White Horse.

375
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,519
Really?

376
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,759
No 10 kilometer run, no guard duty,

377
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,799
and you still make officer?

378
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,160
Of course you're not a White Horse, sir.

379
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
Alvin.

380
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,119
I know it's you, you dumbass.

381
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,279
What the…

382
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,519
Can you stop being immature

383
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,960
and get back to the problem, please?

384
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Don't react.

385
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
Listen.

386
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,119
Back, back.

387
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Let's get back.

388
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Where's Rajah?

389
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,079
Shit. They know that we're following them.

390
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,119
Hadi, Rajah. Let's go.

391
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,160
Where'd they go?

392
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,559
What's wrong with you?

393
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,640
He shot himself in the head.

394
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:34,559
What's that?

395
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,880
You seriously expect me to believe that
they all killed themselves?

396
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,119
Like what? Mass suicide?

397
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,720
And that this guy,

398
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,960
Private Frankie Low.

399
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,200
This big guy impaled himself on a tree?

400
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,160
Look, I know you want
to get out of the army but

401
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,000
is this really the way to do it?

402
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:29,359
Come on, just give me
the facts without all the drama.

403
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Please.

404
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,640
All AWOL soldiers accounted for.

405
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,640
Can we go now?

406
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,519
You know what?

407
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,440
Shut up.

408
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,359
We should have listened to Hadi.

409
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,160
-He was right all along.
-I said shut up.

410
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,000
How did Suppaiah hang himself?

411
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,519
And what about DeSouza?
Why did he kill himself?

412
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,680
What about Frankie?
Did you ever think about Frankie?

413
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,680
Why don't you ask them
when it happens to you?

414
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,400
You think you're funny, is it?

415
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,519
Alvin, shut up.

416
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,839
He's got a point, you know.

417
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,839
How are we going
to explain this in the report?

418
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:39,160
Let me worry about that
when we get off this island, sir.

419
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,119
Hey.

420
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,240
What's that sound?

421
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,319
We're lost.

422
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,000
We're walking around in circles.

423
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,039
How long has it been?

424
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,759
My watch is dead.

425
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,000
Feels like five, six hours?

426
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,400
We should be at the shore by now.

427
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,640
We must have gone off course
and taken a turn somewhere.

428
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,720
What?

429
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,759
What?

430
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Did you see that?

431
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,799
There's something there.

432
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,400
I saw someone.

433
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Alvin.

434
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,319
Something.

435
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,319
Don't mess with me, man.

436
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,119
Sir, he's losing it.

437
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Maybe.

438
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,119
How come we didn't see this before?

439
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,240
What do you think, guys?

440
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,200
Who wants to find out what's inside?

441
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:32,559
You're asking us?

442
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,880
We should go in,
rest and come up with a plan.

443
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,920
Really?
'Cause every bone in my body says

444
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,759
dying out here is better
than dying in there.

445
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Rajah.

446
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,079
Alvin.

447
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,960
No.

448
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,359
I'm staying out here.

449
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,840
Goddammit.

450
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,039
Did you see?

451
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,000
Tell me you guys can hear that.

452
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,199
Say you can hear it!

453
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,360
We're going in.

454
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,400
Hey,

455
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,679
hey.

456
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,360
Are you lost?

457
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,199
Who are you?
And why are you doing this to us?

458
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,760
Alvin, shut up and stop scaring her.

459
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
I'm scaring her?

460
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,639
You want some food?

461
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,480
Anybody has rations?

462
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,000
Nope.

463
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,039
Alvin, go get some food.

464
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,079
Yeah, sure.

465
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,760
What do you want? Some hamburgers? Or…

466
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,119
or maybe some nasi lemak?

467
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,639
Maybe some noodles?

468
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,840
How about I go to 7-11
and buy something for everyone?

469
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,760
Am I the only sane one in this bloody hut?

470
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,880
Why don't you shut your mouth
and use your brain instead?

471
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,159
The AWOL soldiers have fullpacks.

472
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,119
Go check.

473
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,880
Are you crazy? I'm not going out there!

474
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,760
Rajah, wait.

475
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,519
Look, this hut wasn't here before.

476
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,840
You really think it's normal to find
a little girl in the middle of nowhere?

477
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,679
Maybe she split up from her parents.

478
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,079
You said people
come here for barbecues, right?

479
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,159
Yeah, but…

480
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,559
Do you think she's not freaked out
by soldiers walking into the hut?

481
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,000
Why are we still even talking about this?

482
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,119
Alvin,

483
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,400
give me your weapon.

484
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,920
Now.

485
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Hadi?

486
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,280
Hadi!

487
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Hadi!

488
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,280
Hadi?

489
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,760
Is that you?

490
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,239
Hadi, quit messing about man.

491
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,800
You're freaking me out.

492
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,280
Where is that idiot?

493
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,519
Where's Hadi?

494
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,840
-June?
-Rajah.

495
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,639
Don't be the hero, June.

496
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,440
I'd give you some,

497
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,239
but it's probably older than you.

498
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,199
I was saving this for later.

499
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,480
But there may not be a later, eh?

500
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,880
Two-niner, this is one-zero.
You acknowledge? Over.

501
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,800
Lt. Heng, this is Sgt. Han.
Do you copy? Over.

502
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,440
One-zero. This is two-niner.

503
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:02,639
One-zero. This is two-niner.
Do you acknowledge? Over.

504
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
Sgt. Han!

505
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,360
Sgt. Han! This is Lt. Heng.

506
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,719
This is Lt. Heng.

507
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,400
Do you copy? Over.

508
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,920
Sgt. Han! Sgt. Han!

509
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,880
This is Lt. Heng.

510
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,679
We're still on Pulau Hantu.

511
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,119
We are in need of immediate assistance.

512
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:23,119
Do you acknowledge? Over!

513
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,239
Dammit.

514
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,280
This isn't happening.

515
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,079
This is not happening.

516
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,840
Rajah.

517
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,079
June!

518
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,039
Rajah!

519
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,760
Rajah!

520
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,800
Hadi!

521
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,119
Alvin?

522
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:24,639
This is not happening.

523
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,079
Everything okay?

524
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,800
Hadi?

525
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,280
Alvin.

526
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:44,920
Rajah,

527
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:46,840
why didn’t you help him?

528
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,800
Why did Alvin kill himself?

529
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:38,519
Don't be upset.

530
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:47,480
Kill her

531
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:49,159
and burn this place to the ground.

532
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,239
Rajah.

533
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,960
Rajah, calm down and stop overreacting.

534
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:56,079
Calmly, I'm telling you,

535
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:57,440
we're all gonna die here.

536
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:58,480
One by one.

537
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,480
What the hell is wrong with you?
This is not what is happening.

538
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:04,800
This is what?

539
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:06,199
This is what?

540
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,760
Don't pretend you know what to do.

541
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:09,159
We're all dying here.

542
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:11,920
We're killing her.

543
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:13,360
That's the only way.

544
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,239
Rajah,

545
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:20,800
stand down.

546
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,559
June,

547
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,000
I'm trying to save you.

548
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,239
Do you want to die here too?

549
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:02,320
Leave this place.

550
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,719
Leave!

551
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,960
-Give me your weapon!
-We will end this now.

552
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:41,960
-Give me your weapon!
-We end this now.

553
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:43,599
Kill the girl and we can end this now.

554
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,000
We end this now.

555
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:46,679
We end this now!

556
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:48,920
Sir, we end this now, sir.

557
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,559
-Rajah…
-We end this now.

558
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,280
Maybe she has something to do with this.

559
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:55,559
Maybe she doesn't.

560
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:59,199
But we can't kill her.

561
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,960
Lower your weapon, Rajah.

562
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,800
Lower your weapon,

563
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,079
or we all go.

564
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,079
Now do you believe me?

565
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,800
Move out.

566
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,559
Back to the burial site now.

567
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,920
June,

568
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:54,039
grenade.

569
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,840
Let's go.

570
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:01,800
Hadi.

571
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,840
Hadi!

572
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:03,920
They’re all dead.

573
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:06,519
Rajah?

574
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:09,000
Rajah?

575
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,519
He was just with us.

576
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:12,639
He's been here all the time.

577
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:14,039
Look, he was with us in the hut.

578
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:15,000
He tried to kill the girl.

579
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:16,159
He must have been trying to…

580
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:18,320
save us.

581
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
To warn us.

582
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,039
What the hell is going on?

583
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:23,679
The legend…

584
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,519
The legend was wrong.

585
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:29,000
I was wrong

586
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,880
about everything.

587
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:33,559
The bomoh,

588
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:35,559
the villagers,

589
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:37,760
they're innocent.

590
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,440
The mother…

591
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:41,360
She's evil.

592
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,480
And that sign.

593
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:46,440
It's an evil sign.

594
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,039
And she has it.

595
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,519
Anyone that has the sign,

596
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:54,159
is evil.

597
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,639
What do you mean?

598
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,760
All this,

599
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,159
around us,

600
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,880
she did this to make us scared.

601
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,440
We'll put everything back,

602
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:04,840
just as we found them.

603
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,440
No, no.

604
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:08,320
No negotiating,

605
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:09,639
no praying.

606
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,719
She's going to kill us off one by one,

607
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,719
till she finds the
perfect body to possess.

608
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,840
And after that,

609
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:17,079
it's finally over.

610
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,280
We're getting off this island.

611
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,840
Hadi, what?

612
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,519
Soldier!

613
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,320
June,

614
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,840
lower your weapon.

615
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:46,719
Hadi,

616
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,519
I guarantee you

617
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,199
we will get off this island.

618
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:52,920
June,

619
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:55,159
lower your weapon.

620
01:03:55,719 --> 01:03:56,559
Now!

621
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:06,519
Hadi!

622
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:07,840
-Dammit!
-Hadi!

623
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,760
Hadi!

624
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,119
Sir, I don't remember this place.

625
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,320
Stay close to me.

626
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:28,400
He's around here somewhere.

627
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,599
Sir.

628
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,199
June!

629
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,840
Lt. Heng?

630
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:33,480
Hadi?

631
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,960
What happened, Hadi?

632
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,800
Some…

633
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:22,359
something pulled me.

634
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:28,239
Listen to me.

635
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,800
Listen to me.

636
01:08:30,199 --> 01:08:31,359
I found the shore.

637
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:32,720
I found our boat.

638
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,560
We're getting off this island,

639
01:08:35,239 --> 01:08:36,199
Okay?

640
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,159
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

641
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,920
Hold your fire! June?

642
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:50,159
Hold your fire!

643
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,319
I saw her. Did you see her?

644
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,800
Who?

645
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:55,720
I saw her. She was standing right here!

646
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,000
She was standing right here!

647
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,520
June,

648
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,560
look.

649
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,840
Hadi?

650
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:15,920
Hadi.

651
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:20,920
Give me your FAD.

652
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,079
Give me your FAD!

653
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,399
Hadi.

654
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,239
I saw the woman,

655
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:28,720
I shot the woman… I didn't shoot him.

656
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:29,760
I didn't shoot him!

657
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,239
I didn't shoot him! It's not me.

658
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:32,359
It's not me!

659
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:34,720
Hadi! Hadi, I'm sorry.

660
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:37,159
Hadi, I'm sorry.

661
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:38,680
Come here.

662
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:48,680
We have to go, June.

663
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,600
Stick with me on this one.

664
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,920
Hold it together.

665
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,479
We have to go now,

666
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,560
Okay?

667
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,000
It ends now.

668
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,720
Come with me.

669
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,159
Come with me!

670
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,199
June, keep on going.

671
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,479
I found it once, I can find it again.

672
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,159
Should have left a…

673
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,920
Left a trail.

674
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,720
Okay.

675
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:04,399
Don't give up on me, June.

676
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:06,479
We will find it.

677
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:08,439
We will find the boat,

678
01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:10,560
and we'll get off this island,

679
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,479
Okay?

680
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:22,239
Alright,

681
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,800
you rest.

682
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,079
I'll keep watch.

683
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,119
June, what are you doing?

684
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,840
June.

685
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:25,720
No, June.

686
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,159
No.

687
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,520
Let's move.

688
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:18,840
June.

689
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:20,119
June!

690
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:46,359
June?

691
01:13:47,239 --> 01:13:48,199
June?

692
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:17,079
June?

693
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:24,720
June?

694
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,720
Try them again.

695
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:53,840
Lt. Heng, acknowledge? Over.

696
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,159
Do you copy? Over.

697
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,319
Sergeant, we looked everywhere.

698
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:00,359
There's no one here.

699
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,039
You heard him say Pulau Hantu, right?

700
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,359
If this is a bloody joke…

701
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:16,479
Hold your fire.

702
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:21,000
Put your weapons down!

703
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,319
Get him. Get him, get him!

704
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:42,359
Enough!

705
01:16:43,159 --> 01:16:47,960
Enough of this crap about bomohs
and pontianaks and vampires.

706
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,479
We didn't find a single thing
on that island, okay?

707
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,319
There was no blood,
no shell casings, no bodies,

708
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,239
nothing.

709
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,079
-What do you want--
-We've been here all night.

710
01:16:57,159 --> 01:16:58,720
You haven't told me a single truth!

711
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,279
-Sir…
-Just shut up!

712
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:03,000
You only open your mouth

713
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:04,840
if you're going to tell me the damn truth!

714
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,520
Now what the hell happened out there?

715
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:07,439
I told you.

716
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,640
All that shit really happened, okay?

717
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:12,039
All those people, they killed themselves.

718
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:13,920
And I killed June.

719
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:15,640
I admit.

720
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,560
I killed June.

721
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:37,439
Last chance.

722
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:39,159
Just you and me.

723
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:42,960
Give me a proper explanation.

724
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,039
Some things can't be explained, man.

725
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:49,680
Everything can be explained.

726
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,760
It's just whether
I choose to believe it or not.

727
01:17:57,399 --> 01:17:58,359
You know what?

728
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:00,159
You're wasting my time,

729
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:02,239
and you're pathetic.

730
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:03,840
Call yourself a soldier.

731
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,760
No, I don't.

732
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,319
All I know is,

733
01:18:07,399 --> 01:18:08,800
I come back home,

734
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,039
I get a phone call from your army,

735
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:17,279
saying that I have to step up
to the plate for two weeks

736
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:21,439
to fill a pair of boots
I have no interest in filling.

737
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:25,319
Then you send me off to
some crap-hole island

738
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:26,880
in search of some

739
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:31,279
lost AWOL soldiers

740
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:33,880
that I don't particularly care about,

741
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:34,960
let alone know.

742
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,119
And right now,

743
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:42,119
I'm stuck here,

744
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,359
in front of you,

745
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:46,560
trying to convince you what happened,

746
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,279
when all this time

747
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,399
I'm trying to think to myself

748
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:54,880
why I'm still alive.

749
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:01,760
Well done.

750
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,760
Seven soldiers are missing.

751
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,760
Your story is going to go down as folklore

752
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:12,119
among soldiers who say
they heard it from a friend of a friend.

753
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:33,199
Go.

754
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:37,279
You're letting me go?

755
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,760
Yeah, for now.

756
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:42,560
Your Daddy's outside.

757
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,039
He's surrendered your passport so…

758
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:49,319
we'll be talking again.

759
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,279
I've told you everything I know.

760
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,279
Yeah, yeah, you killed June

761
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:01,079
because you were protecting yourself.

762
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,960
Yeah got it.

763
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,960
Let's see what June has to say about that.

764
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,720
She's alive?

765
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:15,600
And if her story contradicts yours then…

766
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:17,920
you'll be seeing me again very soon.

767
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:22,239
Hey,

768
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,399
remember where you are, okay?

769
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:27,079
Guilty until proven innocent.

770
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,119
Get out of my face.

771
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:02,399
Sir,

772
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,520
he's sticking to his story.

773
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:09,279
Yeah, and if June backs it up then…

774
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,800
I’ll just bury the report
with all the others.

775
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:15,680
Listen, sir…

776
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:20,399
…just maybe,
there is something to what he's saying.

777
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:44,000
You alright?

778
01:21:48,359 --> 01:21:49,319
Here's your passport.

779
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,479
You can go back to London.

780
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,880
So Master Sergeant,

781
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,079
are you going to give me
a straight answer?

782
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,680
What happened out there?

783
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:37,560
Whatever Lt. Heng said is true.

784
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,159
I know we can't explain it,

785
01:22:39,239 --> 01:22:40,159
but it happened.

786
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:47,239
Alright, just start from the beginning,
okay?

787
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:53,560
Can I have some water, please?

788
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:10,039
Go ahead.
