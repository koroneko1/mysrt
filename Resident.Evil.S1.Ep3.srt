-[young Jade] I think she looks great.

I mean, you said it yourself.

Come here.

You'd tell me
if something was wrong, right?

You should go.

[Dodger] Well, you've come
to the right place.

I don't know what you've heard,
but since our outfit's taken over,

246
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,954
passage is much safer.

you've got to put the customer first.

and your feet tucked in tight.

Tijuana was a setback.

285
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,789
But Joy still represents
the future of this company.

286
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:39,916
For most of its history,

287
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,419
Umbrella's been a contractor
for the US government.

288
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,465
But if we're gonna survive,
we have to look elsewhere.

289
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,341
Outward, to the people.

290
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,136
That's why you put me in charge.

wants to suspend this project.

Oh, you heard wrong.

00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,520
Right, Al?

00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,399
[Albert] Prescribed in the correct dosage,

295
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,944
Joy can be a miracle pill.

296
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,865
An antidepressant that lowers anxiety,
increases focus.

297
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,868
But the drug contains
a derivative of the T-virus.

298
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:19,289
A pathogen we originally developed
for the American military.

299
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,041
That project was, um…

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,959
ill-fated.

301
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,838
And while we thought
we'd solved the problem,

302
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:31,593
in larger doses, the viral load
not only activates the T-virus,

303
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,512
it becomes transmissible.

304
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:34,971
Usually through a bite.

305
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,389
[Janet chuckles]

306
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,683
So we just tell people
not to bite each other.

For rats, it takes a few hours.

315
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,374
For a human…

three days.

317
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,420
But the end is always the same.

The T-virus makes monsters.

319
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,762
Joy, could be a billion-dollar drug,

320
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:19,850
but we need to delay the launch
until we can stabilize it.

321
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,520
[Evelyn] Well, I don't
see this as a problem.

00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,439
Wait, did you… Did you say
you don't see that as a problem?

323
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,066
[Evelyn] It's an opportunity.

324
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,025
Yes.

325
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,819
We need to rethink Joy.

326
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,863
That gives us a chance to make it better.

327
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:38,994
See, in our trials, we found
that slightly tweaking the virus

does something unexpected.

[meows]

334
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,486
So this is our billion-dollar idea?

335
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,114
-Dogs?
-[Evelyn] No.

336
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:20,035
Our team anticipates
a similar response in human trials.

337
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:25,332
Which means,
it goes beyond the "feel good."

338
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:30,420
The new Joy would allow us
to influence attention, behavior,

339
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,589
all through a series of triggers.

340
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:37,010
So imagine that same pattern
on a website or an app.

341
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,679
A Joy user wouldn't be able to look away.

342
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,891
So we're doing mind control now?

343
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,893
[chuckles]
Of course not, Janet.

344
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:49,231
But hey, who hasn't popped a Xany
and gone hunting for Louboutin's.

345
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,190
Right, Alan?

346
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,818
Joy will make Umbrella
the biggest company in the world.

347
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,071
Fuck Google, Fuck Zuckerberg.
They deliver eyeballs.

348
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,325
Umbrella will deliver minds.

349
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,119
That's not a billion-dollar drug.

350
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,666
That's a trillion-dollar drug.

351
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,336
None of which eliminates the danger.

352
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,797
How much would I have
to take to turn into…

353
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:15,715
that?

354
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,342
Let's see.

No?

357
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,473

-Al?

Twenty thousand.

361
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,946
So we know what goes on the warning label.

362
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,781

This is a reminder
that all personal items,

366
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:55,255
including purses, helmets, and cellphones
should be kept in your locker.

Well, even if I had,

I've got principles.

And where's that?

394
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,207
The University.

395
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,626

00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:58,962
No.

It's like a… a backup disk
for civilization.

401

It will help us rebuild

We can turn the world vegan if we want to.

502
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:22,428
And who gets to decide any of that?

503
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:23,679
Oh, I do.

504
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,143
[Evelyn] My friend at the FDA
agreed to rush human trials.

505
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,229
-[cage thuds]
-[Albert] Because you bribed him.

506
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,565
Because I'm such a charming lady.

507
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:40,238
But I need you to stabilize the formula
and bring production online.

[sighs]

509
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,701
What happened in Raccoon City,
we'll take precautions.

510
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,620
The only precaution is a cure.

511
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,164
-We don't have one of those.
-So let me find one.

512
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,501
-Look, get me a team.
-I need you focused.

513
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,169
[Albert] I can do both.

514
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:59,799
And, look, if something does go wrong,
and the virus gets out of control…

515
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:07,557
imagine how much money
Umbrella makes if you own the cure?

[Evelyn] And Joy come first.

-Fine.

[rat squeaking]

00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:24,323
-[Albert] Wait, Evelyn, don't do that.
-Oh, and, Al?

522
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,286
No more surprises.

523
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,998
I don't like surprises.

[Ms. Foster] Viral modulation.

527
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:45,386
Think of it as Darwinism
on a molecular scale.

528
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:49,307
Virus has literally changed
the cells of their host

529
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,810
for their own survival and reproduction.

530
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:58,024
And as a virus alters
or modulates its host,

531
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,152
what does that look like to us?

Sweating, vomiting,

00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:18,085
to the extreme cases where viruses
attack the blood-brain barrier,

536
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:20,463
causing hallucinations.

537
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:27,511
Changes in mood, behavior,
violent outbursts,

538
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,640
until the body can fight it off or…

maybe if I just ignore it…
