1
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,760
-How're you doing?
-Okay. Yeah, I'm all right.

2
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,320
I'm sitting here with one of my lawyers
who is also listening in.

3
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,280
Are they gonna take my case?

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,199
No.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,519
You'll have to request
a court-appointed lawyer.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,920
What? But Benjamín said--

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,120
Request one.
Keep denying the accusations.

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,039
What?

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,799
You don't know why you said it.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,479
Say it was temporary insanity.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,799
That I was outta my mind?

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,560
You were out of your mind. Yes.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,679
-Yeah. All right.
-Just deny it.

14
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,439
Since there's no evidence…

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,880
They only have your word.
You're going to retract.

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,240
Then I imagine
they'll release you on bail.

17
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,960
And the bail?

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,759
I'll get the bail money for you.
I promise you.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,239
What do you mean,
you're not bailing him out?

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,959
Not for now.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,280
The lawyers say the perception of Samuel

22
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,680
as a noble and humble kid
is his best shot.

23
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,840
And if he were able to quickly get
a large sum of money to pay the bond--

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,760
What? He'd no longer be noble and humble?

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,040
It would arouse suspicions.

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,040
Samuel turned himself in for Dad?

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,159
He was that stupid?

28
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,000
And expects Dad to help him out?

29
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,680
I wouldn't have done that
even as a joke.

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,719
Did you ever think he was protecting
someone else, and not just Dad?

31
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,359
Come on, Dad.
You gave him your word.

32
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,879
But this is the best way
to help him get out.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,879
I'll tell him that.

34
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,280
When he gets out, he won't have to worry
about anything for the rest of his life.

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,760
Mencía…

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,280
-Why did he confess?
-It's complicated.

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,840
-Was he protecting someone?
-No.

38
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,919
I don't know.

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,879
I mean, what I do know
is that Samuel isn't guilty.

40
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,120
And he needs bail money so we can get him
out of jail until the trial.

41
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,039
How much are we talking about?

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,479
Twenty-five thousand euros.

43
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,919
Well, I'll see what I can do.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,840
Seriously?

45
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,439
Yeah. After all, Samuel's one
of the few worthwhile people in school.

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,599
Wow, Phillipe, I don't know what to say.

47
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,759
You're not one of those people.
You don't need to say anything.

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,479
I know
that Armando kept some files

49
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,520
that prove my association with him.

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,800
He tried to blackmail me
because I was having doubts.

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,639
And if you get rid of them?
Of Armando's files?

52
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,680
Then you'd pay the bail bond?

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Of course.

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,159
That's the idea.

55
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,319
I don't understand why he hid the SIM card
in the phone he gave me, y'know?

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,520
Well, because

57
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,360
what place could be as far removed
and unreachable for me as you?

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,080
I mean, so are these all the documents
you wanted to get rid of?

59
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:43,240
Well, we'll have to see, but I think so.

60
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,680
Okay.

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,080
Now that that's done,
when are you gonna bail Samuel out?

62
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,879
Um, well, first,
I would need to talk with my lawyers.

63
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,439
You're not bailing him out, are you?

64
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,000
Honey, um…

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,400
…there are a lot of files to read through,

66
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,560
and we need to sit down
and carefully think through our strategy

67
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,759
and make sure
there are no copies of the SIM card first.

68
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,560
Strategies and copies, my ass!

69
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,439
Mencía, you haven't made
a copy of the SIM card?

70
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,800
Please tell me
you haven't made a copy of that card.

71
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,360
The minute I start trusting,

72
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,800
you suddenly do some shady shit,
and I feel like a complete dumbass.

73
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,920
Everything Samuel and I did
was to protect you, Ari, and ourselves.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,319
And, of course, Guzmán.

75
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,959
It was the lesser of two evils, kid.

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,639
You kept your mouth shut

77
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,000
because it was the lesser evil,

78
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,680
even if it incriminated my dad
in the process?

79
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,480
Well, yes. I won't lie to you.

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,920
I was so here for that.

81
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,319
But Samuel chose
to sacrifice himself for everyone,

82
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,680
Including your dad.

83
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,720
Look, man,

84
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,639
we've more than accepted
that you and I aren't goin' anywhere.

85
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,759
Not together.

86
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,360
And I'm not gonna keep fighting
or pushing to change things

87
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,399
or tryin' to make you forgive me
or stop giving me that death stare.

88
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,560
But make sure Benjamín moves his ass
and gets Samuel outta there.

89
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,560
I really don't think he's gonna do that.

90
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,160
Why not?

91
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,600
Remember the cell phone?
You know, the one from Armando?

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,879
Well, as it turns out,
there was a SIM card

93
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,720
with some sort of documents
on it incriminating my father.

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,000
I had to hand the card over to him
in exchange for him paying the bail bond.

95
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,040
And, well, I don't think he'll pay for it.

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,319
And you wonder why I kept my mouth shut
to bring your dad down?

97
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,120
What I don't get
is how you can still trust him.

98
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:19,160
Because someone once told me I had to
'cause that's the whole deal with…

99
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,199
…with being his daughter.

100
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,480
Guess you don't remember.

101
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,959
And, uh, you haven't, by any chance,
made a copy of that SIM card?

102
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,600
Oh, also?

103
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,759
I never really accepted it.

104
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,639
What you said about

105
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,000
how you and I basically aren't going
anywhere together and all that.

106
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,680
I told you it's not a good idea.

107
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,759
I want to do a classmate a favor, Mom.

108
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,920
Phillipe, I spoke to Benjamín,
and he told me not to pay.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
Why did you ask him?

110
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,079
How is it his business?

111
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,560
I've arranged it so you can't withdraw
more than 300 euros from your accounts.

112
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,120
End of discussion.

113
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,920
Even if my dad doesn't pay,
I'm working on it.

114
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,680
Phillipe offered to.

115
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,240
But they went and cut him off,
just like they did to my siblings and me.

116
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,600
It's all 'cause of my father.

117
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,839
He believes it's better
for the strategy and… for you.

118
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,319
Well, if he says it's better…

119
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,240
Do you hear yourself?

120
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,920
Your dad wouldn't leave me hanging.

121
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,639
He's not a liar like you are.

122
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,600
-We're not talking about that.
-How's it goin' with Iván?

123
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,319
-Good?
-Samuel.

124
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,360
We are not gonna be doing this right now.

125
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,439
I came here to help you.

126
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,319
Why'd you go and turn yourself in?

127
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,560
You really let my dad
get to you that much?

128
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,040
Doesn't matter.

129
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,199
I won't stop until I get you out of here.

130
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,920
I'd rather see you hate me
to my face than stuck here in jail.

131
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,879
Garçon! Two more.

132
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,279
Well…

133
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,840
…should we have
dinner together? Huh?

134
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,440
-So?
-For a change.

135
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,080
You and me, me and you.

136
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,559
Okay, fine.

137
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,279
And then we can call some girls…

138
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,480
They'll come home with us,
we'll have a few drinks, and… party!

139
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,600
-Of course.
-How about it?

140
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,120
I thought you meant just you and me.
It struck me as odd.

141
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,159
Oh. We could do that.

142
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,360
You and I, alone, sad, and abandoned…

143
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,639
Or like a normal father and son, right?

144
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,120
For a change.

145
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,639
Okay, fine.

146
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,200
I'll get a table.

147
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,919
Garçon!

148
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,480
Table for two.

149
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,440
Ari?

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,679
Oh, uh… I just got back
from seeing Samuel, and…

151
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,759
So I should probably leave you alone, huh?

152
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,559
Well, stay if you want to.

153
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,480
It's just,
I don't know what to do to help him.

154
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,639
I don't know.

155
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,679
And I feel bad 'cause I really hurt him.

156
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,080
And I wasn't there
to stop him from doing what he did,

157
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,120
you know what I mean?

158
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,000
You really love him, don't you?

159
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,879
I do.

160
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,799
I won't stop till I get him out.

161
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,840
And once he's outta there,
I'll be with him all the time.

162
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,960
All the time.

163
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,159
Then let me help you out, okay?

164
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,320
It'd be sad if the son
of the best soccer player in the world

165
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,960
couldn't get that money together.

166
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,720
Yeah, but why do you wanna help me,
though?

167
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,159
Because if you're happy, Ari,

168
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,519
then I am too.

169
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,399
How are
your classes, school, and stuff?

170
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,320
Fine.

171
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,320
If you want
a normal father-and-son dinner,

172
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,759
you gotta do your part.

173
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't just use "monosyllabs."

174
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,360
-Mono what?
-"Otonanopeias"?

175
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,919
You're right, Dad.

176
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,480
Everything is great.

177
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,960
-Yeah?
-I'm happy.

178
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,200
I hope it lasts.

179
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,480
How come?

180
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,200
Why's that? Huh? Huh?

181
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,519
Huh?

182
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,240
-Son of a bitch.
-You're asking if there's someone?

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,360
Yeah, I've got someone
on the brain.

184
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,399
Really?

185
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,879
Who is she?

186
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,080
What? Is it a he?

187
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,240
No.

188
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,440
Is it Patrick?

189
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,799
It's a she and a he.

190
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,159
It's both.

191
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,320
And the guy is Patrick, yeah.

192
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,360
Who is the girl?

193
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,240
His sister.

194
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,279
Ari.

195
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,039
What are you now?

196
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,519
Iván, your son. My pleasure.

197
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,159
I don't understand.

198
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,799
What's up with you?

199
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,679
I don't understand you
either, to be honest.

200
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,519
I don't know.
Ari drives me crazy, you know?

201
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,120
Turns my whole world upside down.

202
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,360
As for Patrick, he brings me peace.

203
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,600
He soothes me.

204
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,559
I feel great when I'm with him.

205
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,840
He makes my world right again.

206
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,279
And they're both okay with that?

207
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,039
Ari doesn't know I was with Patrick.

208
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,120
It happened at home.

209
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,440
And it was amazing.

210
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,320
But because it was him.

211
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,120
It wouldn't be the same with someone else.

212
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,279
Well… that's just kids' games.

213
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,679
It's only natural to experiment,
but it leads nowhere.

214
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,600
And I know what I'm talking about.

215
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,159
-Did you experiment?
-Me?

216
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,039
Never.

217
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,399
Kids today are nuts.

218
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,720
What's with that?

219
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,480
"Nuts," meaning less prejudiced?

220
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,559
-Maybe?
-Jesus Christ!

221
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,919
Fuck.

222
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,000
Does Patrick know
that you're with his sister too?

223
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,559
I should tell you
that Ari has a boyfriend.

224
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,360
The guy who was arrested.

225
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,720
They're raising money to bail him out.

226
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:23,320
I promised her I'd help.
That I'd talk to you.

227
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,759
Those 25,000 euros are peanuts.

228
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,200
You can spend twice that on a party.

229
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,840
Will you

230
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,480
help us?

231
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,000
Focus on that girl, Ori.

232
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,440
-Ari.
-Right.

233
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,879
Focus on her.

234
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,320
-Uh, did you hear what I said?
-And did you hear what I said?

235
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Just get the check and let's go.

236
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,320
You can call all those girls
who are gagging for you!

237
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,279
Is that what you want, Macho Man?

238
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,480
What's up, Héctor? See ya.

239
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,759
-Iván?
-Fala galera!

240
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,360
This Friday night,
there'll be a very special pink party.

241
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,480
We all know you can't buy love.

242
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,759
But can you buy a date
with the person you like the most?

243
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,679
Of course you can.

244
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,120
Hey! Look.

245
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,039
And trust me,
it'll be for a good cause.

246
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,759
The proceeds from the party

247
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,120
will be used to bail out
our classmate Samuel García.

248
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,639
I don't know him very well,

249
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,720
but he makes some people
who are important to me very happy.

250
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,440
Let's enjoy the party, guys.

251
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,440
Isa!

252
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,120
-I need to ask you for a huge favor.
-Me?

253
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,120
 You got this.

254
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,200
Babes? How's it going, guys?

255
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,240
Let me explain a little bit to you
about how this whole thing works, okay?

256
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,759
Everyone here tonight
has an app on our phones.

257
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,400
Mingle and keep an eye out
for the person you like the most

258
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,440
and make a note
of the number they're wearing.

259
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:13,079
Next up, you go
back into the app and enter that number.

260
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,680
That's how you're going to put bids in
for that person.

261
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,720
Basically, whoever drops the most coin

262
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,920
gets to nab the sexy main character
of their wettest dreams.

263
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,799
Ah. I mean, of course.

264
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,000
-So, I'm gonna have to bid on you?
-No. Just on a date with me.

265
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,519
And spoiler alert. I'm bidding on you too.

266
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,240
I mean, you and I can't possibly have
something normal together, can we?

267
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,799
-There's no way.
-No way.

268
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,440
Uh, no, it's impossible.
But it's for a good cause, right?

269
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,880
Hey, you know, weren't you kinda into
good causes and stuff? Yeah?

270
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,839
Totally. I'm super into them.

271
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,039
I'm donating my paycheck
to getting our first kiss.

272
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,960
All right, well, let's just bid,
and we'll see what happens, okay?

273
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,559
-Hmm?
-Hmm.

274
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,359
Until that happens, I'm gonna get drunk
if that's not a problem.

275
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,680
Okay.

276
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,519
TOTAL EARNINGS
€2,670

277
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,279
Isadora.

278
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,559
Isadora!

279
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:39,759
Isadora, we gotta do something.

280
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,039
People look like they're fallin' asleep.

281
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,440
I dunno. Change the music.
You gotta wake 'em up.

282
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,599
Okay. Okay. All right.

283
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,319
-Cool.
-Got it. Yeah.

284
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,519
Hey! You planning on dancing
any time soon?

285
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,559
You look like the walking dead.
Remember, we're here for a good cause.

286
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,200
We gotta dance,
put out good vibes, bid, okay?

287
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,559
BID FOR #37
YOUR BID €200

288
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,839
BID FOR #26
YOUR BID €200

289
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay. Cool.

290
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,519
Hey, friend. I need a favor. Come with me.

291
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,200
-What do you have?
-Molly.

292
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,799
Know what?
I'll just leave it right here for you.

293
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,319
You know what you're doing.

294
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,599
You look really great.

295
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,599
Clearheaded. On it, y'know?

296
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,559
Mm-hmm. Yep. All day, every day, baby.

297
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,599
Right.

298
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,160
-What're you doing?
-Is this a fucking joke?

299
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,680
-What are you doing?
-Couldn't you have waited?

300
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
What's my problem?

301
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,720
Oh great.

302
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,359
You know what?
I hope you shit your pants and die.

303
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,319
Okay, move!

304
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,240
Excuse me.

305
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,319
-Hey, Isadora!
-You gotta be kidding.

306
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,480
I put in all this effort, and he bids
for the other girl. That fucking--

307
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:06,039
-Hey, stop! It's occupied!
-Yeah, yeah. All right.

308
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,480
-Ah.
-What's that?

309
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,880
I thought you were gonna quit that shit.

310
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,039
Did you and me not see the same thing?

311
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,880
He's bidding on you!
You won! Leave! Go away!

312
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,279
-Give me that.
-No!

313
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,359
-What are you doing?
-Show an ounce of self-respect.

314
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Seriously? You'll take drugs
based on if Phillipe gives you attention?

315
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,079
That's not why.

316
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,240
That's not the reason. It's just--

317
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,319
-Can't you see it?
-What?

318
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,640
Don't you realize I'm not the real Isadora
if I don't take this shit?

319
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,519
I'm not the one they adore,
who charms them all.

320
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,559
-Didn't you hear what he just said to me?
-Isadora.

321
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,319
"You're very clearheaded"
or whatever shit he said to me in there.

322
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,920
I don't know
why I'm making the effort.

323
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,079
-I don't like you. At all.
-I don't like you either.

324
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,799
-And you're obnoxious.
-You're a nasty-ass busybody, know that?

325
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,440
Look in the mirror much?

326
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,759
Now, do you think the Empress of Ibiza

327
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,960
appears out of nowhere
because of these magic powders?

328
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,000
Of course she doesn't. Obviously.

329
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,640
-Give me that.
-No.

330
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,440
Come on.

331
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,519
Go out there right now
and become the badass empress.

332
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,039
Do what you came here to do, okay?

333
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,519
Bring this place back to life.
Go out there and flex, bitch.

334
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,920
You don't need any guy's approval.

335
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,519
-Come on.
-No. No, I can't.

336
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,359
-Hey, get out there!
-Okay, fine! I'll go!

337
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,200
-All right. I'm going. I'm gone.
-Okay!

338
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:38,079
Babes, I want everyone
to pay special attention to me

339
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,559
because this Valentine's Day party

340
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,680
is about to get real spicy
right about fuckin' now.

341
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,000
Cupid's in attendance,
and I gotta say, I'm so excited.

342
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,759
Very, very excited
to ask him this first question.

343
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,599
Cupid? Who's your first target?

344
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,920
Rebe!

345
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,759
Yes, Rebe! I love it! Of course.

346
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,119
C'mon. What? What?
Aren't you Samuel's friend?

347
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,279
Okay, okay, okay.

348
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:10,039
What do we think
about this lovely creature?

349
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,119
She's hot, isn't she?

350
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,119
And actually, I have a gift for you,
you know?

351
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,240
-What?
-Baby, I'm gonna give you… the runway.

352
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,519
Give it all you've got, queen!

353
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,079
-Bid on Rebe.
-What? You bid on her, rich girl.

354
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,160
My dad froze our accounts
so we wouldn't pay for Samuel's bail.

355
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,319
Wow. I'm likin' your dad
better and better.

356
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,039
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

357
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,480
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

358
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,640
Come on. Please bid on her.

359
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,920
-I have no money, Mencía.
-Don't you play that poor-kid card, Omar.

360
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,880
-You owe me, all right?
-Yeah, totally.

361
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,480
BID FOR #13
YOUR BID €100

362
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,519
Hey! Hey! Hey!

363
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,559
Hey! Hey!

364
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,839
Dude, some girl's bidding.

365
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,440
No name, but she keeps bidding.
She's relentless.

366
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,279
All right, party people!

367
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,920
There you have it in lights.
Lucky number 13, okay?

368
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,039
The only bad luck
this number might bring you tonight

369
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,400
is if someone takes her home
and that special someone isn't you.

370
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,279
Let's see. You! Give me a number.

371
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,119
-Uh, thirty-seven?
-Thirty-seven, it is!

372
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,359
Oh.

373
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,079
My dear friend Patrick.

374
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,960
Please, baby girl. Stop playing shy.

375
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,000
You love the stage. Get your ass up here.

376
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,359
Patrick! Work it, baby!

377
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,839
Patrick! Patrick!

378
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,000
-Yeah!
-Patrick!

379
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,880
If you were to fire up Wikipedia

380
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,039
and look up God himself,

381
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,759
you'll see this hottie's face
smiling back at you.

382
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,200
Take him! Get this serial sinner
away from my virgin eyes, please!

383
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,079
Cupid, dear…

384
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,039
My next question's
the one I've asked all night.

385
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,000
And that question is,
"Who's your next victim gonna be, huh?"

386
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,440
I love it!

387
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,839
-Well, well, well!
-Yes, yes, yes.

388
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,559
-Cayetana! Your time has come.
-Go on and do it. Go on.

389
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,119
-Come with me, girl.
-Bid on me, okay?

390
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,640
Get it, get it, get it!

391
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,599
You may know her
as the cleaning lady,

392
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,920
but she's absolutely worth paying
all the gold in the world for.

393
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,839
You know!

394
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,880
Yeah!

395
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,720
-Let's get those bids in. C'mon!
-Yeah, Caye!

396
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,119
Go, Cayetana!

397
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,839
YOU'VE BEEN OUTBID FOR #39

398
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,720
Do it! Do it!

399
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,200
Know what I'll do?

400
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,640
I'm gonna give a bottle
of anything they want

401
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,680
to whoever screams loudest
on the count of one…

402
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,440
-Two…
-Three!

403
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,079
Come on. What's the matter this time?

404
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,799
Seven thousand and fifty euros!

405
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,160
I mean, that's not even enough
to pay half of it.

406
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,759
Okay, calm your tits.
The night's not over yet.

407
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,079
Hey, guys.

408
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,119
I'm here for my date.

409
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,559
Pfft. Super fuckin' great.

410
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,200
And who won me?

411
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,480
Holy shit.

412
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,559
-What are you doing here?
-Look, son, I felt bad.

413
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,920
I felt bad
for not helping youse

414
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,799
with bail money for your friend,
so I wanted to make up for it.

415
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,519
Forgive me, son.

416
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,519
You bid for him so that I wouldn't win?

417
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,240
Iván, the girl is very pretty.
Look at her.

418
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,079
-What's going on?
-So, how's the fundraising going?

419
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,440
Bad. Awful.

420
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,720
No problem at all.
So, I'll pay the difference, okay?

421
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,720
Wait, you serious?

422
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,079
Seriously.

423
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,359
For the lady.

424
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,640
Thank you!

425
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,319
Cheers.

426
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,880
Hey. I appreciate this,
what you and your dad did.

427
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,440
-I feel like I'm in your debt.
-No way.

428
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,359
I didn't organize all of this
to make you feel even more confused.

429
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Mm-hmm.

430
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,880
If you're with Samuel…

431
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,640
I want you to enjoy him when he gets out.

432
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:14,519
Okay, so you bid on me because, mm…?

433
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,079
-To help raise more money.
-Ah.

434
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,839
And because… I dunno.

435
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,319
If he's freed tomorrow,

436
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,359
I was thinkin'
maybe you could give me one last night.

437
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,119
Just in case, I dunno…

438
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,799
Do you know what?

439
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,319
I bid on you tonight too.

440
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah?

441
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,799
Mm-hmm.

442
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,960
-Not here?
-No.

443
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,599
Okay.

444
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,759
Why don't we go?

445
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,279
What's wrong?

446
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,039
You're upset 'cause of my son?

447
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:19,240
No, no, no. No way.

448
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,680
"No way." Right.

449
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,519
He told me what happened between you.

450
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,039
He did?

451
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,359
Fuck.

452
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,359
I mean, he likes you.

453
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,039
But he likes Ari more.

454
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,039
That's it.

455
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,559
Not personal.

456
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,039
I figured… it's better you
know the truth now and can move on.

457
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,799
Well…

458
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
that's it then.

459
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:53,960
It's over.

460
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,000
He tried it, and he left.

461
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,920
One day, maybe I'll find a guy
who stays, right?

462
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:07,039
And that guy
will be the luckiest guy in the world.

463
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,440
You're very quiet.

464
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,720
I have a song
stuck in my head.

465
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,200
What song?

466
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,119
I wish I could sing better.

467
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:51,519
It's your last night,
and you're not gonna fuck me?

468
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:56,119
I… I'd rather just hang
if this is my last night with you.

469
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:05,640
I mean, after all,
we can always have sex another day, right?

470
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,880
There won't be another day.

471
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,720
-No?
-Mm-mm.

472
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,160
Not even like this?

473
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,759
Like what?

474
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:21,039
-A bathtub and candles?
-Yeah.

475
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,799
No.

476
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,359
Well, I prefer this to sex, still.

477
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,559
We can enjoy both.
They're not mutually exclusive.

478
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,480
Yeah?

479
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:32,720
Yeah.

480
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,200
No way to beat her. This chick's intense.

481
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,720
Jess, I'm so sorry about this.

482
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,319
You're fuckin' awesome, I swear.

483
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,240
I hadn't found
the right time to tell you--

484
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:30,240
Go to hell, Rebe.

485
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,279
Are you okay?

486
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,359
Yeah.

487
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,359
Shit, looks like
she just about knocked your jaw off.

488
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,359
I maybe think I…
I just won a date with you.

489
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,640
Do you mind if I take a rain check?

490
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,279
Sorry, but right now,
I just want to go home and climb into bed.

491
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,960
Course.

492
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,200
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

493
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,599
Rebe!

494
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,440
-I'm leaving.
-Why?

495
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,680
Because the little prince
must've won the date with you,

496
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,720
so I'll clear out
and let you two enjoy it.

497
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,759
Hmm. Not so fast.

498
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,680
It's not that easy
for you to get rid of me,

499
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:39,119
'cause I won a date with number five here,

500
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,680
which I'm pretty sure is you.

501
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,960
-Right.
-Okay.

502
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,039
What?

503
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,640
You don't want a date with me?

504
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,920
I mean, ever since I've known you,
Phillipe has always been in the way.

505
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,920
He's always showing up
in some way or other.

506
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's impossible for the two of us
to have something normal.

507
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,720
Yeah. Impossible until now
because now we can fix it with this date.

508
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,640
Yeah, but I don't want that kind of date.

509
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,279
No?

510
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:08,280
No, and I don't want our first date
to be crazy memorable.

511
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,320
I want it just normal.

512
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,320
You know? With some beers or some coffee.

513
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,079
Not, uh, a giant rave
full of bougie psychos

514
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,920
who won't let you have any privacy
and are always up your ass.

515
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,960
Yeah.

516
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,280
Maybe, yeah. You're not wrong.

517
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,719
Caye, I've come
to this side of town twice.

518
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,840
When you wanna come to mine, text me.

519
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,199
-Mm.
-Okay?

520
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Okay.

521
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,960
-I'm out.
-Okay.

522
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,079
-Good.
-See you.

523
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,440
Look, there's a girl who really likes you
and is giving you everything,

524
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:59,440
so would you just be with her
and leave me alone? All right?

525
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,280
Want a glass of water?

526
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,000
Hmm… a really strong drink.

527
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,920
You seduced me into coming
all the way here but won't kiss me?

528
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,679
I'm thinkin' about my son.

529
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
Don't do that.

530
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,480
He's out with my sister,
who he likes better than me, right?

531
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,920
Tonight, make me feel
like you're the luckiest guy in the world.

532
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:36,000
And in the morning?

533
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,760
We'll see tomorrow.

534
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,599
Ari…

535
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,920
…my father's back.

536
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,119
Wait, I thought you said
your dad was cool?

537
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,199
You should leave, okay?

538
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,559
I'll take you home.

539
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,639
Did I make you uncomfortable somehow?

540
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,000
No, no. You didn't.

541
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,679
But… you really should leave.

542
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:35,280
Listen, we'll go out the back door
so he won't see you leaving.

543
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,280
Okay?

544
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,039
Thanks.

545
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,480
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

546
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,679
It wasn't my father.

547
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,280
It was all Iván.

548
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,880
Good to see you back.

549
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,360
Samuel, wait!

550
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,960
Patrick!
