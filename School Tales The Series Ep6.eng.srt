00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,520
There is a story about an ordinary food stall

2
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,640
that found overnight success as the best-selling food stall

3
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,720
in the school cafeteria.

4
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,640
And it is said

5
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,600
that there was a secret hidden in the food stall's soup.

6
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,560
Hello, I'm Kong, or Click, the Hardcore Truth-seeker.

7
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,560
HE'S HERE

8
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,360
Today, I'm going to review a food stall…

9
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,720
RIGHT ON TIME

10
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,120
…that became a sensation…

11
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,280
WHAT'S UP?

12
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,280
…overnight.
I'M A BIG FAN

13
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,520
It went from shitty…

14
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,640
THE LAST ONE WAS SO FUNNY

15
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,560
…to amazing.

16
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Here's the story.

17
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,320
This lady used to serve rice with soups and curries.

18
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,480
When she switched to serving spicy pork bone soup, bam,

19
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,640
things got better for her.

20
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,400
It really is good.

21
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,560
-HAHA, HE SLURPED -IS IT THAT GOOD, KONG?

22
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
I'VE EATEN THERE. IT'S SO GOOD

23
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,800
Her food stall has no name.

24
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,760
EPIC

25
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,440
But the whole school calls it "Aunty Jong's place."

26
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,280
Let me tell you something. The most important point here

27
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,160
is that

28
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,680
the son of the stall owner

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
is a drug dealer.

30
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,200
In our school, the drugs that Jong's son sells the most

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,880
are probably amphetamine and weed.

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
He comes after school.

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,480
He and I usually meet behind the toilets.

34
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,760
Aunty Jong knows all about it.

35
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,920
Remember, she may look like a nice person,

36
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,880
but looks are deceiving.

37
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,120
It's possible

38
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,520
that she put weed

39
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,040
in her soup.

40
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,720
You know, I'm not sure.

41
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,080
I've eaten some, and I thought it was good.

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,200
I liked it.

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,440
I don't know.

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,000
But I think other stuff must be in there. That's why it tastes this good.

45
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,120
Shit.

46
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
There's other stuff?

47
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,400
Of course there is, dumbass.

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,560
Here you go.

49
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:16,640
TASTY SPICY PORK BONE SOUP

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,960
SOLD OUT

51
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,320
UNIQUELY DELICIOUS

52
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,520
The coast is clear.

53
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,240
TIME TO START DIGGING

54
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,760
START DIGGING NOW, KONG

55
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,720
Let's go.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,880
Right now, everything is going our way.

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,680
It seems like the soup is sold out for the day.

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
That means

59
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,320
we are all about to see what's at the bottom

60
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,000
of her pot.

61
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,040
Let's check it out.

62
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,560
SOLD OUT

63
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,360
SHOW US
Here we go.

64
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,960
DELICIOUS

65
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,400
HURRY UP

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,280
THIS IS HELLA FUN. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE PLOT TWIST

67
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,360
THEY SAY SHE PUTS DRUGS IN HER SOUP

68
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,920
-IS SHE BACK YET? -GO ALL THE WAY

69
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,480
Yeah!

70
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,240
That's what we hardcore truth-seekers do.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,960
Watch, everyone.

72
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,120
Today, I'll show you what's really in here.

73
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,600
Don't go anywhere. Stay tuned.

74
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,720
What? Shit!

75
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,520
My dear, what are you doing in my stall?

76
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,600
Well? Please leave.

77
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,200
Well, Aunty, I am live streaming about how delicious your food is.

78
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,240
I won't be long.

79
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,680
Can I see what's in this pot?

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,600
My dear, stop it.

81
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,320
Don't do this.

82
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,440
Please leave, dear.

83
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,680
Wow. You're acting so fishy, Aunty.

84
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,240
See, everyone?

85
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,480
Look, everyone.

86
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,600
You're acting so fishy, so there must be something in the pot,

87
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,080
or you wouldn't mind sharing.

88
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,240
Move aside, Aunty.

89
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,920
SHOW US

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,840
Move!

91
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,080
SHOW US

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,360
-Don't. -Move, Aunty.

93
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,360
AWESOME
Ouch.

94
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,880
What bones are those?

95
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,320
-Shit. -Shit!

96
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,240
Fuck!

97
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,400
What?

98
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,720
A dog's head.

99
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,080
-Shit, a dog's head. -Kong!

100
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,000
-Hey. -You okay?

101
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,320
-What is it? -Hey.

102
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,960
-It's a dog head. -A dog's head.

103
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,880
Aunty, why did you do this?

104
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,600
It's a dog.

105
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,880
-What? -Aunty Jong fed us a fucking dog's head.

106
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,320
-Shit! -Shit!

107
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,240
-You guys, look. Look. -Take a picture.

108
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,800
-Take pictures. Go on. -Sure, Kong. I'll take pictures.

109
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,520
-Shit, I just ate that. -Take photos.

110
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,480
-Take photos. -You're gonna get it for sure.

111
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,680
Take photos.

112
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,920
What the hell?

113
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,800
How long have you fed us dogs' heads?

114
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,480
-Yeah. -How the fuck could I eat it?

115
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,880
How could she do this?

116
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,680
Shit.

117
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Damn dogs' heads.

118
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,000
Aunty, how the fuck could you do this?

119
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,440
It's a dog's head in the pan too. It's clearly a dog's head.

120
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,200
What the fuck?

121
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,200
I think it's…

122
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,520
Aunty Jong, how could you do this? Well?

123
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,160
I'M GOING TO BE SICK

124
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,360
THE BITCH MUST GO TO JAIL

125
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,200
I WON'T EAT HER SHIT ANYMORE

126
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,200
THE SCHOOL NEVER CHECKS SHIT

127
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,240
THE WHOLE COUNTRY KNOWS YOU NOW

128
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
POOR DOGS

129
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,200
Look.

130
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,280
-Shit. -Show him too.

131
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Let me see.

132
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,160
Which one?

133
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,280
Let's see.

134
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,360
Shit.

135
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,560
-Clear as fucking day. -Yeah.

136
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,720
Aunty Jong is fucking done for.

137
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,920
Where did she get dogs and cats to cook?

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,760
So many still live behind the building.

139
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,680
Right.

140
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,720
But I think the point is not where she got dogs and cats from.

141
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,480
The question is, how long has she fed us fucking dogs and cats?

142
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,400
Ew.

143
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,920
-Shut the fuck up. -I'm going to throw up. Shit.

144
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,840
So where is the skull we found?

145
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,840
I heard the school director had Mr. Pob, the science teacher, take it away

146
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,840
in case it can be used to prove that Aunty Jong fed dog meat to students.

147
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,440
Shit, I think this is a good thing.

148
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,440
If it had gone on any longer… Who knows?

149
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,400
You and the whole school could end up barking like damn dogs.

150
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,320
We ate dogs.
-Shit. -Fuck.

151
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Kong, you're the hero of the hour.

152
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,320
Move.

153
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,440
Well, then,

154
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,680
can I have a cigarette, Mr. Hero?

155
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,120
It hurts! I'm hurt!

156
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,320
-What hurts? -What?

157
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,120
Ouch. Don't touch me, guys.

158
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,560
-Where? -It hurts here.

159
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
Here.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,080
-Shit! -Shit!

161
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,840
-Hey. -Awesome.

162
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,880
Hey, can I take a photo?

163
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
Shit.

164
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,840
Shit, you're my fucking idol, man.

165
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,240
I'll get a tattoo too.

166
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,360
Which tattoo place did you go to? Do you guys want to come too?

167
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,280
Sure.

168
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,640
How cool.

169
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,560
-I'll get my neck inked tomorrow. -Kong.

170
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,440
Where's my cigarette? Don't pretend you didn't hear me.

171
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,320
-Just a sec, for fuck's sake. -Hurry up.

172
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,440
-You're so slow. -Just take it.

173
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,640
I HOPE SHE GETS FIRED SOON. SHE CAN WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE

174
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,560
DID SHE EVER EAT HER OWN FOOD?

175
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,480
BARF! EVIL!

176
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
KONG DESERVES ALL THE CREDIT

177
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,520
KONG DESERVES ALL THE CREDIT

178
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,120
KONG, KEEP US UPDATED ON THAT DOG SOUP BITCH

179
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,480
MORE POWER TO ALL THE LITTLE GUYS WHO EXPOSE EVIL. KUDOS

180
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,520
IT'S TASTY, BUT IT'S A NO-NO

181
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
Kong, thank you so much.

182
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,240
KONG, YOU'RE BLOWING UP

183
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,320
THEY'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS ON CLUBHOUSE TOMORROW

184
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,840
I LOVE YOUR QUEST FOR TRUTH

185
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,360
Kong, thank you so much.

186
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,960
ACCORDING TO SOME INSIDERS, AUNTY JONG'S SON IS IN A DRUG CARTEL

187
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,560
KONG MUST HAVE KNOWN. THAT'S WHY HE STARTED EXPOSING HER

188
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,760
What the hell is up with Aunty Jong's son?

189
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,480
How dare you bump into me?

190
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Who the fuck was that?

191
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,160
Hold on!

192
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,680
What?

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,840
Fucker.

194
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,760
What do you want?

195
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,760
Well? Acting all shady like this?

196
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,400
Tell me what you want.

197
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,440
You're not answering? You wanna be mysterious?

198
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,080
I'll film you and post it online. Come at me if you dare.

199
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,440
I'll get you.

200
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,480
Show your face. Who the fuck are you?

201
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,440
Shit!

202
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,960
Shit!

203
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,280
Fuck.

204
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,480
Shit!

205
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Don't! No!

206
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,280
Don't, motherfucker! Don't!

207
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,360
Shit!

208
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,560
Did you see that? Did you see that just now?

209
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,680
Did you see that?

210
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,760
Fuck!

211
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,120
Did you see it? He was going to kill me.

212
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,920
I don't see anyone.

213
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,840
I know who sent you.

214
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,760
You think you can threaten me?

215
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm not afraid of you, motherfucker!

216
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,960
TASTY SPICY PORK BONE SOUP

217
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,360
Is the old bitch here?

218
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,720
Hey, the old bitch is fucking here.

219
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,680
Hurry up.

220
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,080
All right, I'm trying.

221
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,320
She's looking this way.

222
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,960
-Let's go. -Okay, let's go.

223
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,680
YOU MADE SOUP OUT OF DOGS, YOU EVIL BITCH!

224
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,840
Aunty.

225
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,200
Aunty.

226
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
What is it, dear?

227
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,160
You paid someone to stalk me, didn't you?

228
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,840
You think you can threaten me?

229
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,920
I see.

230
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,240
Are you afraid I'll expose you on Clubhouse tonight?

231
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,920
Fine.

232
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,880
You're dead. I'll fucking expose you.

233
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,880
Wait, dear. What are you talking about? I know nothing about that.

234
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,720
Shit. Jod.

235
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,960
Come over here.

236
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,680
Film it! Go on!

237
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,120
Hi, everyone.

238
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,680
Ever since the incident at this stall, I have been stalked.

239
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,320
HER DAMN SON DID IT

240
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,240
Aunty.

241
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,880
You tell everyone.

242
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,480
Keep filming.

243
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,960
Who did you pay to stalk me?

244
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,400
What do you mean, dear?

245
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,960
Look, everyone.

246
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,040
She's the one who put dogs and cats in her food and fed it to us all.

247
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,640
And when she got caught, she paid someone to stalk me.

248
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,360
-No. -Aunty, admit it.

249
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,320
-I didn't. -Confess.

250
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,600
I've never used dogs and cats to make soup, sweetheart.

251
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,600
You're still lying? We have evidence. The whole school saw it.

252
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,280
Well? Why are you lying?

253
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,240
-My dear… -There he is!

254
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,400
-There. Look. -Wait.

255
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,320
Wait. Please.

256
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,720
-There's really someone in there. -What do you mean?

257
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,880
Where is he?

258
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,120
Wait, dear. What do you mean? There's no one. I'm here alone, dear.

259
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,520
I beg you. Don't cause trouble for me.

260
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,480
I LOVE KONG

261
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm not causing trouble. I'm seeking the truth.

262
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,280
Instead of begging me, speak to the camera and to everyone.

263
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,680
Just confess what you've done. Well?

264
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,840
Everyone wants to know the truth. Aunty, move aside. I'll prove it.

265
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,120
-Hey. -Look, everyone.

266
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,920
Look at that picture there.

267
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,880
Here.

268
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,280
I'm sure this is the person stalking me.

269
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,800
Wait. Hey.

270
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,840
I didn't see his face, but I think it's him.

271
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,080
No.

272
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,480
This is my son.

273
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,800
WE FOUND THE SECRET

274
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,400
I see.

275
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
TERRIBLE SON

276
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,600
This is your son?

277
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,360
He's your son, right?

278
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,560
DO DRUGS, DO TIME

279
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,240
She finally confessed.

280
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,600
EVIL FAMILY

281
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,960
This is her son

282
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,360
who is rumored on the Internet to be a drug addict and an ex-con.

283
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,840
You got your son to stalk me, right?

284
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Just admit it.

285
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,000
-THE COPS WILL GET YOU -WHY IS SHE CRYING?

286
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,200
Why are you crying?

287
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,480
Well? Do you feel guilty?

288
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,600
EVIL FAMILY

289
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,120
Jod, follow me.

290
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,600
All right, everyone, today, I'll show you the truth about Aunty Jong.

291
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,480
What's behind her stall? Let's find out.

292
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,880
Hey, kid.

293
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,440
LEAVE, AUNTY!

294
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,400
That's enough.

295
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,240
There's no one else here.

296
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,560
Jong has worked here by herself all this time, I'm telling you.

297
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,320
-WHO'S HE? -HER NEW HUSBAND? HAHA

298
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,360
-Follow me, everyone. Jod. -What?

299
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,320
-What are you up to? -Follow me, everyone.

300
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,920
Let's look inside. Where are you?

301
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,600
Jong, calm down. Don't cry.

302
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,720
-Where are you? Film it. -Where?

303
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Come out! You can't get away! You can't get away, motherfucker!

304
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,400
-No one's here. Let's go. -Hey!

305
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,800
Enough, you little shit!

306
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,960
That picture is from his funeral.

307
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,880
Do you hear me? Jong's son died over a month ago.

308
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,320
I'll tell you something. Come here.

309
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,600
Look. The urn is right here.

310
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,720
Open your fucking eyes, won't you?

311
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,200
Can't you see? His mom has worn black for weeks.

312
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,760
I'll tell you something.

313
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,560
Her son was decapitated.

314
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,720
His head still hasn't been found.

315
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,720
Can you imagine?

316
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,720
A mother had to cremate her own son whose body was missing its head.

317
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,080
How much pain must she have endured?

318
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,920
And you keep harassing her.

319
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,520
You little shit!

320
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,680
What are you waiting for? Get the hell out!

321
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,600
Go and apologize to Jong right now.

322
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,960
-I can get out myself! -Go!

323
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,240
-All right! -Get out!

324
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,880
Get outta here, you punks!

325
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,840
-I can fucking walk myself. -So damn nosy!

326
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,760
Last time, he barged in and hurt her.

327
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,480
Here he goes again. Who the hell does he think he is?

328
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,520
Yeah, he's such a clout chaser.

329
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,640
Hey, go and apologize to her right now.

330
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,040
Why should I?

331
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,240
I did nothing wrong. She really made food with dog meat.

332
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,520
If I hadn't exposed her,

333
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,920
we'd all still be eating dogs.

334
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,960
She didn't cook dogs or cats or anything like that.

335
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,000
There's only one way to go in and out.

336
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,680
We stall workers here can see

337
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,960
that she buys food from the market every day.

338
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,560
You're just spewing nonsense, you punk.

339
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,480
Go!

340
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,720
But the other day, everyone here saw it.

341
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,160
That really was a dog's skull in the soup.

342
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,520
Right?

343
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,920
That's enough, Kong.

344
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,800
What you found, which you claim is a dog's skull,

345
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
actually came from a chicken.

346
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,960
I had the so-called skull tested at the university's lab.

347
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,000
They said the bones look similar.

348
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,480
You have to look closely to see the differences.

349
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,960
Mr. Pob, listen to me.

350
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,120
You see,

351
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,360
someone said that they saw Aunty Jong put a dog in a sack and hit it.

352
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
I'm telling the truth.

353
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,400
Can you bring that person here to confirm this story?

354
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
It's someone on the Internet.

355
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,760
You can read the comments. Everyone is talking about this.

356
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,800
Sir, I'm not lying.

357
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,040
Kong.

358
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,320
It's the Internet.

359
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,440
That person may not even be real.

360
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,920
Apologize to Aunty Jong now,

361
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,880
then go see the principal.

362
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,720
I won't apologize to her.

363
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,440
I did nothing wrong.

364
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,960
Aunty Jong really cooked dog meat for all the kids here.

365
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,240
I'm trying to help everyone.

366
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,240
I knew it. She's a good person.

367
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,400
She wouldn't do that.

368
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,480
So true. Besides, she's so old. She's too slow to catch dogs or cats.

369
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,080
Well, how do you explain why her cooking suddenly tastes better?

370
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,840
-Enough. -She put something in it.

371
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,120
That's enough, Kong.

372
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,360
Apologize to Aunty Jong, then we'll go to the principal's office.

373
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,000
Hey, Mr. Pob, let me go.

374
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,280
I won't apologize.

375
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,880
There must be something, sir. Let me go.

376
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
MOVE THE CAMERA

377
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,920
MOVE THE CAMERA

378
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,560
-WTF, KONG? -THE TABLES HAVE TURNED

379
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,680
Is this what you want?

380
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,920
I saved you all from eating dogs, right? And you're doing this to me?

381
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,800
Kong!

382
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,840
-Come back! -Wait.

383
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,280
What? Let me go!

384
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,280
Hey, wait!

385
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,400
-Hey. -Hey.

386
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,520
How did it go, Kong? What's your punishment?

387
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,720
-A parent meeting, dickhead. -Damn.

388
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,240
And I gotta apologize to that bitch at the assembly tomorrow

389
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,320
so that she won't press charges, or I could go to jail.

390
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,960
Shit, man, I'm so fucking mad about this.

391
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,640
You know, right, that I did this for everyone?

392
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,920
I think you should apologize to Aunty Jong and end this.

393
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,240
Why should I? I did nothing wrong.

394
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,520
You're one of them now?

395
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,200
It's okay.

396
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,320
Today, on Clubhouse, I'll keep exposing her dirty secrets.

397
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
She'll be ruined.

398
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,400
Damn, Kong. What fucking Clubhouse?

399
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,200
They've canceled it.

400
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,000
And now

401
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,680
they've set up a room to bash you, you know that?

402
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,920
"What an epic fail."

403
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,120
"I knew it."

404
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,440
"Something felt off."

405
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,360
"Just another clout chaser."

406
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,520
"For all we know,

407
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,480
he could be the one who put the bones in the pot

408
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,840
and made shit up."

409
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,760
-Shit. -Shit.

410
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,560
Shit, those fucking assholes…

411
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,160
This morning, they supported me. You saw that, right?

412
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,160
And now they've switched to bashing me?

413
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,160
Fuck them. And…

414
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,520
I'll expose all those trolls on my page.

415
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,320
And you guys have to help me, okay?

416
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,160
You'd better apologize to Aunty Jong and end this.

417
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,280
You'd better apologize via live stream before you get witch-hunted for real.

418
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,200
That's true. I agree with him, dude.

419
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,200
Why the fuck should I? I did nothing wrong.

420
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,440
Look, I'll show you how it's done.

421
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,600
I'm so sorry.

422
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,520
I didn't know what I was doing.

423
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,040
I didn't mean it.

424
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,800
-See? You can cry too. -It's not funny, assholes.

425
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,680
Do you see me laughing?

426
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,240
Fine.

427
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,080
I'm gonna find proof

428
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,480
that the old bitch put some shit in the soup.

429
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,200
I'll fucking destroy her.

430
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,200
Will you really do that?

431
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,960
If you do that,

432
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
I, for one, won't be a part of it.

433
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,520
You're on your own.

434
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,640
What?

435
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,360
You asshole. Jod, seriously, are you…

436
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
are you ditching me?

437
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Honestly, Kong,

438
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,280
you're just…

439
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,640
using social media to bully people.

440
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,040
If you still can't see it, that's your problem.

441
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,080
I'm done with you.

442
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,000
-Let's go, Song. -Okay.

443
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,920
You guys are fucking…

444
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,000
Fucking what?

445
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,400
You're fucking assholes!

446
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,000
Fuck you. How could you say that?

447
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,840
Are we still friends? Well?

448
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,840
Break them up! What are you waiting for?

449
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,280
-How could you say that? -That's enough.

450
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,360
-How could you say shit like that? -I told you to stop!

451
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,840
-Are you all right? -Hey!

452
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,200
-Calm down! -What?

453
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,800
Calm the fuck down!

454
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Enough, okay, guys?

455
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840
Use your head.

456
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,000
You were filming for me this morning. How can you say that, Jod?

457
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,520
Let's just fucking go.

458
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,120
Is this what friends do?

459
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,960
He's fucking annoying.

460
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,240
Okay, assholes, fuck off, then! I'll be fine by myself!

461
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,680
I don't need shitty friends like you!

462
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,320
Piece of shit.

463
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,760
-Really? -How can she do that?

464
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,520
You're gonna get it. You're done. Take photos.

465
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,320
What the hell?

466
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
How long have you fed us dogs' heads?

467
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,560
How could she do this?

468
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,080
Shit.

469
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,440
Damn dogs' heads.

470
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,960
Aunty, how the fuck could you do this?

471
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,880
Jong's son died over a month ago.

472
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,360
Can't you see? His mom has worn black for weeks.

473
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,200
Enough, Kong.

474
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
Apologize to Aunty Jong now.

475
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,960
I won't apologize.

476
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,600
There must be something, sir. Let me go.

477
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,880
Last time, he barged in and hurt her.

478
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,640
Here he goes again. Who the hell does he think he is?

479
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,720
Yeah, he's such a clout chaser.

480
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,200
You'd better apologize to Aunty Jong

481
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,360
and end this.

482
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,720
Hello, I'm Kong, or Click, the Hardcore Truth-seeker.

483
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,520
-Hello. -Hey, Kong. Check your Facebook right now.

484
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,760
Everyone's shitting on you, asshole.

485
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,200
Song bashed you for hitting him today.

486
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,160
Damn, now everyone is shitting on you.

487
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,800
What are you gonna do?

488
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,560
Hey, Kong?

489
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,400
-What? -Are you okay?

490
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,480
-Calm down, okay? -Well…

491
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,680
-Okay. -Are you really okay?

492
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,960
Fine, then. I'll send you the link, okay?

493
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,400
Call me if you need anything.

494
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
-All right. -Okay?

495
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,720
Okay.

496
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,760
DEATH BY TRUTH

497
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,520
I'm telling you, this prick is a clout chaser.

498
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,120
-HE SHOULD PAY -SERVES HIM RIGHT

499
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,880
He messed with her life to get views.

500
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,440
Anyone could see that they were chicken bones,

501
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,320
but he said it was a dog's skull.

502
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,560
Even when we had proof that they were chicken bones,

503
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,440
he still kept lying.

504
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,800
He wouldn't own up.

505
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,120
SHAME ON YOU. WTF?

506
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,880
-DOGS? BULLSHIT -OWN UP TO THIS

507
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,400
-IT'S CHICKEN, NOT DOG -MORON

508
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,560
It's a dog's head.

509
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,800
How could you do this, Aunty?

510
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,480
What the fuck have you fed us?

511
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,280
-YOU'D BE CRAZY TO BELIEVE HIM -DOG, MY ASS

512
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,400
Motherfucker!

513
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,680
Let me go! What the fuck?

514
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,880
Shit!

515
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,520
-WHAT A MORON -WTF IS WRONG WITH HIM?

516
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,520
SO FUNNY, HAHA
Shit.

517
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,040
HE'S FIGHTING WITH A SHADING NET

518
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,360
-Fuck you! -Is this what you want? Well?

519
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,320
Break them up! Kong, come with me! Damn asshole.

520
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,600
Calm down!

521
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,360
-IT'S JUST HIM -CHANGE SCHOOLS, KONG

522
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,680
I saw all your comments, so I had to make another video.

523
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,240
I bet he's getting a shit ton of flak.

524
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,520
I'm sure he's made a video to apologize to Aunty Jong.

525
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,440
He's all like,

526
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,200
"I'm sorry. I didn't know better."

527
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,080
"I'll learn from this mistake."

528
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,920
"Blah, blah." Piece of shit.

529
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,720
I bet he'll release a video like that.

530
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,480
Kong is such a pussy.

531
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,440
Fuck you!

532
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Why did it turn out like this, fucker?

533
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,080
I'm leaving now.

534
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,640
-See you tomorrow. -Okay, see you. Get home safely.

535
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,320
Jong, are you all set for tomorrow?

536
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,000
Why are you done so soon today?

537
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,360
No, I'm not done yet. I'm still missing some ingredients.

538
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,240
I have to go to buy chicken at the market.

539
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,920
They said they'd deliver it today, but they haven't.

540
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,040
I'll get the chicken and come back to stew it.

541
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,520
That's just it. That's what I'm wondering about, Jong.

542
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,000
You serve spicy pork bone soup. What do you need chicken for?

543
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,880
Mr. Pob also said that you use black chicken.

544
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,600
Why do you have to use black chicken?

545
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,960
This recipe is quite strange, isn't it?

546
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,560
Honestly, Jong,

547
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,560
what do you put in it?

548
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,600
Come on.

549
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,240
You're not answering me.

550
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,160
It must be a special secret recipe.

551
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,400
That's amazing.

552
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,320
Well, you're quite something, Jong.

553
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,000
By the way, are you really leaving this place?

554
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,680
Well, I have to stay till the end of the month,

555
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,640
then I'll go.

556
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,480
You poor thing.

557
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,160
What school are you going to work at next?

558
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,920
Nowhere, I suppose.

559
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,960
I doubt any school would hire me now.

560
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,280
My goodness.

561
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,400
Are you going now? We can leave together.

562
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,640
-Yes. Let's go. -Okay.

563
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Get home safely. See you tomorrow.

564
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,880
It's nothing.

565
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,160
Just my imagination.

566
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,360
I'd better go home.

567
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,440
It's creepy in here.

568
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,160
All done.

569
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,800
I'm out. Man, it's been so hot all day.

570
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,840
What the fuck?

571
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,800
Damn it, Jong.

572
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,280
Are you a cook or a witch?

573
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Compared to this,

574
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,480
a dead cat in my bag is nothing.

575
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,400
This shit is way weirder.

576
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,440
I'll get you, Aunty Jong, you bitch.

577
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,600
I'll film everything.

578
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,600
What?

579
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,920
Shit. Why is it acting up now?

580
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,760
What do you want?

581
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,520
Well?

582
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,760
You think I'm scared?

583
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,520
I'll get you.

584
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,760
Let go of me!

585
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,880
You're Jong's son, aren't you?

586
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,080
Didn't they say you died by decapitation or some shit?

587
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,480
You and your mom are dicks.

588
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,080
You fooled the whole school, and they all believe you.

589
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,000
Damn, you're not just a drug addict. You're a horror film addict too.

590
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,600
Right, asshole?

591
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,480
Show me your face if you dare!

592
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,400
Well?

593
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,880
Fuck!

594
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,160
Everyone, have you seen this?

595
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,520
-What is it, Miss? -Kong has lost it.

596
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,560
Many people say he's a clout chaser.

597
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,520
This comment is interesting.

598
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,280
"Kong, what stuff did you take? Tell me."

599
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,400
As in drugs?

600
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,600
Yes. I guess we have to watch him closely.

601
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,600
Mr. Pob, please help me.

602
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,760
Mr. Pob.

603
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,640
Mr. Pob, please help me, sir.

604
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,160
Open the door, sir. Mr. Pob!

605
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,760
Sir, open the door!

606
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,040
Sir, listen to me. Please, sir. You have to help me.

607
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,440
There's a ghost, Mr. Pob.

608
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,440
It's the ghost of Jong's son. He's trying to kill me.

609
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
He just tried to kill me over there.

610
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,960
What are you playing at, Kong?

611
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,600
I'm not playing, sir. There really is a ghost.

612
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,880
He broke down the door. He just tried to kill me.

613
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,520
Take a look. If you don't believe me, let's go.

614
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,440
Come on.

615
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,680
-He was down there. -Let go.

616
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,640
Let's go take a look. Go out there. Here. You go down there. You'll see him.

617
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,280
He's there, I swear. Sir, please believe me.

618
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,800
If you're making it up to get more views online,

619
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,720
go do it somewhere else.

620
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,720
Stop causing trouble for others.

621
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,240
I'm starting to believe what they said about you

622
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,080
being high out of your mind on drugs.

623
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,920
There really is a ghost. I'm serious. He's in that bitch Jong's kitchen.

624
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,560
If you don't believe me, go and see. Why don't you go and see?

625
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,600
And at this hour, what were you doing inside Jong's kitchen?

626
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,360
I asked you a question. What were you doing inside Jong's kitchen?

627
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,280
What have you done to her now?

628
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,920
-Damn. -What?

629
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,800
What's wrong with you? Why are you taking that bitch Jong's side?

630
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,000
-What? -You're being very rude, Kong.

631
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,280
I've had enough of you.

632
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,720
Social media users already know the truth about Aunty Jong.

633
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,240
Why won't you stop this?

634
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,760
I see.

635
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,680
Now you believe what's on social media?

636
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Pointing is rude.

637
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,800
Fine.

638
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,280
Fine.

639
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,960
-Kong. -Kong.

640
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,640
What is it with this kid?

641
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,520
So full of himself.

642
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,520
Whatever the fuck you are, come at me.

643
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,920
I'll cut you to pieces.

644
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,920
Come on.

645
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,560
Who the fuck tied this? Fuck you, Jong.

646
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,520
Shit!

647
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,320
Her son was decapitated.

648
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,640
His head still hasn't been found.

649
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,560
Shit!

650
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,000
Ghost! Shit!

651
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,440
I'm scared. Stop it.

652
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,440
Enough, son.

653
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,800
That's enough, son.

654
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,000
Aunty.

655
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,040
Aunty Jong.

656
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,680
Aunty Jong, I'm… I'm sorry.

657
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,440
Aunty Jong, help me. Please, Aunty Jong. I'm sorry, Aunty Jong.

658
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,920
I'm sorry,

659
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,640
but this is the truth, and I've felt bad about it all this time.

660
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,640
I just want to make a living.

661
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,920
I'm sorry, Aunty Jong.

662
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,600
I promise not to tell anyone about today, Aunty Jong, I promise.

663
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,320
But you have to help me, Aunty Jong.

664
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,760
Please listen to me.

665
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,680
I'm sorry.

666
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,680
Please, Aunty.

667
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,840
I understand you.

668
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,480
You have nothing to worry about.

669
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,920
Don't worry.

670
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,560
I promise not to say anything about today

671
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,080
and about

672
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,520
how you

673
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,920
made soup with a human head.

674
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,600
I promise I won't tell anyone.

675
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,400
I promise, Aunty Jong. Please help me.

676
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,440
I'm sorry.

677
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I shouldn't have chosen this path.

678
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,160
Okay.

679
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,040
Then let's leave together, Aunty Jong.

680
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,280
Let's go.

681
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,320
I was planning on leaving here quietly at the end of the month.

682
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,400
I didn't want any trouble with you.

683
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,480
Aunty, I'm so sorry. I promise I won't mess with you anymore.

684
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,360
But you wouldn't stop trying to hurt me.

685
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,240
You were trying to use a dead cat

686
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,480
to hurt me.

687
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,440
Aunty Jong, listen to me. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

688
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,720
I didn't mean to do that.

689
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,240
-I can explain. -Get out!

690
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
What's the point?

691
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,680
I did everything…

692
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,120
for my stall to survive.

693
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,440
I did everything

694
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,520
to be with my son forever.

695
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,280
I did everything

696
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,720
to protect my beliefs from whoever would destroy them.

697
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,360
But you…

698
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,600
you stuck your nose in my fucking business.

699
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,600
I'm sorry.

700
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,080
Those things you always wanted to know,

701
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,200
you know them now.

702
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,560
Are you happy now?

703
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,080
Well? Are you happy now?

704
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,760
-Aunty. -My son's bone broth…

705
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,400
How was it?

706
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
-Was it good? -I'm sorry.

707
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,120
Fuck.

708
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,360
Why is Aunty Jong's soup extra good today?

709
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,200
I'll have three bowls for sure.

710
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,800
Oh yeah. What the fuck is wrong with Kong?

711
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,000
He's missing school again. He's missing something tasty too.

712
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,560
He wouldn't dare show up.

713
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,760
He was supposed to apologize to Aunty Jong during the morning assembly.

714
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,680
You're right.

715
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,120
He must be avoiding it.

716
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,880
I don't think he'll show up anywhere for a while.

717
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,960
Hey, last night, some people saw him hanging around at the cafeteria.

718
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,240
-He doesn't know when to quit. -Shit!

719
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,400
You should ask Aunty Jong. Maybe she saw him.

720
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,640
Damn. The soup is so fucking tasty today. It's so goddamn good.

721
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,680
You guys.

722
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,000
-Shit! -Shit!

723
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,440
Son of a bitch!

724
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,760
Hey, what's going on?

725
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,440
Wait.

726
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,240
TASTY SPICY PORK BONE SOUP

727
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,440
TASTY SPICY SKULL SOUP

728
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,440
Hello.

729
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,120
I'm Kong,

730
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,160
or Click, the Hardcore Truth-seeker.

731
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,840
Today,

732
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,320
I'm going to apologize for…

733
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,400
I'm going to apologize for what I've done.

734
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,360
Honestly, maybe it's all my fault because…

735
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,840
It's because I'm such…

736
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,280
a clout chaser, and I…

737
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,040
and I…

738
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,400
I didn't know any better, and I'm…

739
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,840
I'm sorry.
