ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,483
You died when you should have lived,

3
00:01:30,027 --> 00:01:32,613
and I lived when I should have died.

4
00:02:19,243 --> 00:02:20,286
I'm scared

5
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:22,329
and nervous.

6
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,503
I know it's crazy to say
something like this in this situation,

7
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:36,969
but I think I should say it.

8
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:42,808
I like you, Ji-su.

9
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,686
Is that

10
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:48,647
God's will, too?

11
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:50,983
No.

12
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:53,485
It's my will.

13
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:48,040
Here.

14
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:53,087
You were always ugly,
but you look way uglier now.

15
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:57,675
You want to live, right?

16
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:00,636
Just act like before.

17
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:03,847
Nothing good will happen
if you're near me.

18
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,018
Get away from me if you want to live.

19
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:10,688
My bad luck will rub off on you.

20
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:12,481
Jeez.

21
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:17,027
You really hate yourself, don't you?

22
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,407
Everyone around me dies.

23
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:25,327
Whether they kill themselves…

24
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:28,831
or get killed by monsters…

25
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:30,291
Are you throwing a pity party?

26
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:40,175
Well, I have really bad luck too.

27
00:04:44,388 --> 00:04:45,848
You know I'm an orphan, right?

28
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:51,895
My family went to see
a ballet performance one day,

29
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:55,774
and we got into an accident.

30
00:04:57,943 --> 00:05:00,487
So both my mom and dad…

31
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,452
My dad said he was tired,
but I was stubborn about going there.

32
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:11,874
I made Eun-hyeok become an orphan, too.

33
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,253
And I ruined Eun-hyeok's life.

34
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:21,008
We're not blood-related at all.

35
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:24,303
And honestly, we're not even family
without our parents.

36
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:28,849
But he took a leave from school
to help me study ballet.

37
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:33,812
He's crazy. He's really crazy.

38
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:38,692
He said it wasn't my fault.

39
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:40,736
He said it's okay.

40
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:45,115
Does he think I'll be okay with it
just because he is?

41
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:48,952
I didn't want to be indebted to him,

42
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:53,749
so I was determined to become a successful
ballerina to pay him back later, but…

43
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:55,042
Damn it.

44
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:57,961
My ankle's so ruined
I can't even do a turn.

45
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:07,137
What do you think?

46
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,598
Am I pitiful?

47
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,605
You seem to think
your life is most pitiful,

48
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:18,524
but it's not.

49
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:20,651
I'll prove it to you.

50
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:24,238
I'm going to survive with you
until the end.

51
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:30,327
I had nothing else to do anyway.

52
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:54,017
Don't try to make yourself miserable.

53
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:56,979
Things are bad enough already.

54
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:07,656
It's been about 30 years.

55
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:10,534
I grabbed a knife
at my first birthday ceremony.

56
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:23,088
JUNG JAE-HEON

57
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:38,520
Jung Jae-heon…

58
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:52,659
Drink as much as you want.

59
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,374
Just five more days.

60
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:45,963
I endured 30 hard years.

61
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:49,800
Five days is nothing.

62
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:18,829
We should find him.

63
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,624
Burn them.

64
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:50,902
Let me ask you a favor.

65
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:54,656
There's something inside this building.

66
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:57,534
-We must find it.
-Find what?

67
00:09:58,535 --> 00:10:02,581
I don't know. An underground tunnel
or a bunker or something.

68
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:04,458
What do you plan to do?

69
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,417
Hide.

70
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,045
More people will die
if we keep fighting the monsters.

71
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:11,465
Young people who have their whole lives
ahead of them are dying out.

72
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,970
I believe that you'll survive this.

73
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:18,764
I can tell from your face.

74
00:10:23,894 --> 00:10:25,896
Grandpa, look.

75
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:00,389
Is the army coming to rescue us?

76
00:11:00,472 --> 00:11:02,015
Are they?

77
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:08,271
Move on your own.

78
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,733
-I'll greet the guests.
-What?

79
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:16,988
You can't trust soldiers
in such situations.

80
00:11:17,072 --> 00:11:18,990
I guess you might not know.

81
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,159
I know it, too.

82
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:25,622
You have a junior colleague now.

83
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:29,292
She's going to be a secret agent, too.

84
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:48,520
It's coming this way!

85
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:51,481
Damn it, this is bad. It's coming!

86
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:33,565
Have you been well?

87
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:42,657
-Hold him.
-Help!

88
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,786
-Stop!
-Okay, one, two…

89
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,336
It's not opening.

90
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:55,754
We failed again?

91
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:12,604
Find everyone who's hiding.

92
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:38,588
It'll be easier to just shoot them.

93
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,717
You always talk about killing everyone.
We should have fun with them.

94
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,427
A robbery in the middle of the day?

95
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:51,059
Didn't your mother buy you any paper?

96
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:53,895
Why the hell did you scribble
on your face?

97
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:58,149
You stupid old geezer.

98
00:13:58,233 --> 00:14:00,902
You've lived enough.
Why are you still alive?

99
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:03,488
-It's not even a good world to live in.
-Goodness.

100
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,449
What kind of losers just intruded and--

101
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:12,289
Say one more word,

102
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:14,040
and I'll tear your jaw off.

103
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:56,833
Your mission

104
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,169
is to stay hidden.

105
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:00,629
You have to stay in there.

106
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:02,547
Don't ever get caught.

107
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:04,215
You can do that, right?

108
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:05,967
But…

109
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:53,098
What about Yeong-su? Where is--

110
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:57,310
It's okay. Everything will be fine.

111
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:18,331
I think it's a bit bigger than last time.

112
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:20,333
Should I measure the area every time?

113
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:22,711
This is your jail now.

114
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:32,387
-No!
-Ji-eun!

115
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:34,472
I'm scared.

116
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:42,814
-Oh, my legs hurt.
-Mr. Han…

117
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:45,316
Mr. Han.

118
00:16:50,864 --> 00:16:53,283
No, Mr. Han! You'll be killed, too!

119
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,285
What do you think you're doing?

120
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:56,453
Come and take her.

121
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:14,345
How could you kill her?

122
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:17,348
People's lives are useless these days.

123
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:31,780
You're so emotional.

124
00:17:32,322 --> 00:17:34,324
Are you going to cry
over every person's death?

125
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,953
Mister, you crossed the line. Go inside.

126
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:40,371
Mr. Han!

127
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:45,085
You can all live harmoniously in there.
You just have

128
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:46,753
a little less room than before.

129
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,219
Damn, they started already.

130
00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:56,012
I missed the good part.

131
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:11,903
Jeez.

132
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:15,156
Hey.

133
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:17,492
Where are you going?

134
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:20,078
You stink right now. A lot.

135
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:21,704
You shit…

136
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:01,911
It's a girl.

137
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,663
A girl.

138
00:19:11,754 --> 00:19:12,672
She's hurt.

139
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,369
That's enough.

140
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:49,292
Get lost.

141
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:57,550
Jung-seop is looking for you.

142
00:19:57,634 --> 00:19:59,594
Stop calling him by his name, you shit!

143
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:05,141
It's really not the time to do that.

144
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,602
You could be killed

145
00:20:08,144 --> 00:20:09,896
by Jung-seop.

146
00:20:44,597 --> 00:20:46,057
I'm Shin Jung-seop.

147
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,143
Let's all get along without fighting.

148
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:52,021
How can you say that after what you did?

149
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:56,401
How can you treat people like this?
Do you think we're beasts?

150
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:58,403
This is all I've seen and learned.

151
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,780
If you all do as I say,

152
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:02,949
I won't kill anyone else.

153
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:05,618
So?

154
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,873
What are you planning to do?

155
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:16,421
We should get to know each other.

156
00:21:17,422 --> 00:21:19,132
I bet you're curious about us, too.

157
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:23,845
Then tell us.

158
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:28,516
Where were you before coming here?

159
00:21:31,477 --> 00:21:32,812
What happened there?

160
00:21:36,107 --> 00:21:38,192
They all died.

161
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:40,028
Did they die?

162
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,572
Or did you kill them?

163
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,169
It was a small church.

164
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,756
They'd had it fortified well,
so I got my hopes up,

165
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,133
but all of them were already dead.

166
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:06,679
What's interesting is

167
00:22:08,222 --> 00:22:10,558
that there weren't any signs
of a monster being there.

168
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:14,187
They had all killed each other.

169
00:22:20,193 --> 00:22:22,445
It's not the time to be worrying
about monsters.

170
00:22:26,657 --> 00:22:28,076
Humans…

171
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:30,912
are the scariest.

172
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,505
What is it?

173
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:42,757
What?

174
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,759
Ui-myeong said you were looking for me.

175
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,348
What? No, I wasn't.

176
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:52,183
You son of a bitch!

177
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:56,187
Did you find anything?

178
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:01,776
A girl.

179
00:23:02,777 --> 00:23:03,861
She's hurt.

180
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:09,033
Hey, stop frowning.

181
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:11,244
These people are already scared.

182
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:21,838
You just left her alone?

183
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:23,673
Why? Was she not your type?

184
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:25,591
Should I kill her?

185
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:27,885
Don't touch her. I'm saving her for later.

186
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:40,731
Are you crazy? Stop standing up to them.

187
00:23:41,357 --> 00:23:43,025
Do you want to get yourself killed?

188
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,819
I did it because I wanted to live.

189
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:48,906
-We have to wait.
-Until when?

190
00:23:51,826 --> 00:23:55,246
It seems they're criminals who killed
soldiers and stole their weapons.

191
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:58,207
And they only have a few guns

192
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,585
when there are dozens
of monsters out there.

193
00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:02,837
But we can't just do nothing.

194
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:05,673
There will be an opportunity.

195
00:24:06,382 --> 00:24:07,216
I'm sure of it.

196
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:13,514
You're not the only weapon we have.

197
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:55,264
SAFETY ON

198
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:57,183
Hey.

199
00:24:58,142 --> 00:24:59,727
You don't know how to use that, do you?

200
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:07,068
No, I didn't serve in the military.

201
00:25:07,151 --> 00:25:08,277
You asshole…

202
00:25:32,134 --> 00:25:33,386
You said you were a firefighter.

203
00:25:33,469 --> 00:25:35,346
I used to be in the special forces.

204
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:37,390
How did you find the rifle?

205
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,183
I saw you hiding it.

206
00:25:54,073 --> 00:25:55,533
You really made an effort.

207
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,579
Who's the leader here?

208
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,042
Who made this?

209
00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:10,298
I did.

210
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:14,635
I heard someone even performed
surgery in here. Who did that?

211
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:16,053
I did.

212
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:20,224
Everyone here is completely useless.

213
00:26:20,308 --> 00:26:22,310
There's an old man and a cripple,

214
00:26:22,393 --> 00:26:23,769
and even a patient.

215
00:26:23,853 --> 00:26:27,189
This place is the worst so far,
but quite a lot of people survived here.

216
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:30,901
You're young,
but I guess you're pretty capable.

217
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:40,369
I like you. What do you say?

218
00:26:41,162 --> 00:26:42,955
Will you abandon them and join me?

219
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:46,876
Or will you…

220
00:26:48,878 --> 00:26:49,879
just die?

221
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:03,851
Hey…

222
00:27:06,437 --> 00:27:07,438
What…

223
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:20,201
You made a good choice.

224
00:27:20,785 --> 00:27:21,786
You're pretty smart.

225
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:23,245
Sir!

226
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:25,581
There's a monster here.

227
00:27:37,343 --> 00:27:38,344
Yi-kyung.

228
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:43,683
Mister.

229
00:27:48,938 --> 00:27:49,897
Come here.

230
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:56,153
Why did you go in there?

231
00:27:56,237 --> 00:28:00,241
Well, my mission was to hide,

232
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:02,410
but I saw Yi-kyung.

233
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:05,871
She's a secret agent, too…

234
00:28:06,664 --> 00:28:11,001
and Grandpa wasn't coming. I was scared.

235
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:16,674
Don't!

236
00:28:18,217 --> 00:28:20,302
It saved me!

237
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,667
She might not be dangerous.

238
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:53,169
She's still human.

239
00:28:53,252 --> 00:28:55,087
-There are monsters that don't harm--
-So?

240
00:28:57,882 --> 00:28:59,967
She's going to be a monster anyway.

241
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:02,136
But…

242
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:04,263
You locked her up because you were scared.

243
00:29:05,848 --> 00:29:07,141
You're such a hypocrite.

244
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:11,729
I thought you were pretty smart,
but you're just a kid.

245
00:29:18,694 --> 00:29:20,029
I'm Shin Jung-seop.

246
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:22,865
I want you to know
that it's nothing personal.

247
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:28,078
Do you have any final words to say?

248
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:30,456
-You asshole!
-Hey!

249
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,583
Oh, come on.

250
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:37,213
You're the toughest
among all the losers here.

251
00:29:43,177 --> 00:29:44,470
Watch and learn.

252
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:52,394
What just happened? Who…

253
00:29:52,478 --> 00:29:54,605
Did they kill Eun-hyeok?

254
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:57,149
He's on their side now.
So it must be Seon-yeong.

255
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,401
They're different from you.

256
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:01,821
They could all get killed.

257
00:30:02,905 --> 00:30:04,031
Hyun-su…

258
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,371
There will be an opportunity.

259
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:12,081
I'm sure of it.

260
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,805
What are you waiting for?

261
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:30,099
You're a doctor.
You should declare her dead.

262
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:17,563
Hypocrisy comes at a huge cost.

263
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:38,417
If we hesitate any longer,
more people will die.

264
00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:40,961
What's your plan?

265
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,424
You don't know how to use a gun,

266
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:48,469
but are you good at getting away?

267
00:31:50,971 --> 00:31:52,765
I've usually been the one chasing.

268
00:31:54,266 --> 00:31:55,559
You must be good at it now

269
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,853
because you're not alone.

270
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:07,988
"I'll get things cleaned up first,
Jung-seop."

271
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:09,740
He's pretending to be so nice.

272
00:32:09,823 --> 00:32:12,201
Why doesn't he just hold a funeral
for her while he's at it?

273
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:16,163
Sir, I'm telling you, Ui-myeong
really doesn't suit our group.

274
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,837
Get her!

275
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:30,886
GREEN SUPERMARKET

276
00:32:36,642 --> 00:32:37,851
What was that?

277
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:39,979
Cha Hyun-su! Now!

278
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:42,564
Come on!

279
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,362
Wait!

280
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,668
Close your eyes.

281
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:06,797
Not you, you shit!

282
00:33:40,414 --> 00:33:42,499
-Get him!
-Get him!

283
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,178
Everyone, stop!

284
00:34:20,245 --> 00:34:21,580
Let them go

285
00:34:22,164 --> 00:34:24,541
before I blow his brains out.

286
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,055
Sir.

287
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:42,392
Sir.

288
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:01,411
No, Ms. An…

289
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:05,225
I'm sorry…

290
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:32,753
You're keeping something strange.

291
00:36:34,129 --> 00:36:36,757
Sir, he'll recover soon.

292
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:39,009
We should kill

293
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:41,261
every monster.

294
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,764
Jeez.

295
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,751
She's really going to die this time.

296
00:37:54,835 --> 00:37:56,753
Shut up, you idiot.

297
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:00,257
Where the hell have you been?

298
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:03,218
Shut your trap. Your breath stinks.

299
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:06,305
What? That son of a bitch…

300
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:11,226
You smell of disinfectant.

301
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:14,313
You'd better go over there.

302
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:16,982
The patient's in bad condition.

303
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,860
I think she might die soon.

304
00:38:23,905 --> 00:38:24,906
No.

305
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:47,054
I'm hurt, too.
Do you want to see my wound?

306
00:39:02,652 --> 00:39:03,487
You bitch.

307
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,828
What? Do you want to go first? Good.

308
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:11,721
Yu-ri…

309
00:41:25,712 --> 00:41:26,546
Hurry.

310
00:41:34,596 --> 00:41:36,556
I knew this would happen!

311
00:41:38,558 --> 00:41:39,851
Drop your gun.

312
00:41:41,186 --> 00:41:43,355
Should we make a bet on who can kill
more people?

313
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:48,568
The side that's more scared
should surrender!

314
00:41:48,652 --> 00:41:49,736
Drop your gun.

315
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:51,655
Drop it, you bitch!

316
00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:04,626
This is just the beginning, you bitch!

317
00:42:13,385 --> 00:42:14,719
Damn it!

318
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,734
My goodness…

319
00:42:57,012 --> 00:42:57,929
Wait here.

320
00:43:20,076 --> 00:43:21,161
I…

321
00:43:24,372 --> 00:43:26,374
killed a person.

322
00:43:28,752 --> 00:43:29,794
It's okay.

323
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,428
He wasn't human.

324
00:43:50,982 --> 00:43:52,025
Here.

325
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:56,154
Let's just burn him.

326
00:43:59,407 --> 00:44:01,368
That's no fun.

327
00:44:06,373 --> 00:44:08,458
Will he die if he falls from here?

328
00:44:09,626 --> 00:44:10,919
No, wait.

329
00:44:11,586 --> 00:44:12,962
Should I take out his intestines?

330
00:44:14,214 --> 00:44:16,966
Or should I cut off his head
and keep it as a souvenir?

331
00:44:19,052 --> 00:44:21,763
-There's no need…
-He's not human anyway.

332
00:44:22,472 --> 00:44:24,182
Well, it doesn't matter even if he is.

333
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,942
Look at him struggling to live.

334
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:30,498
I won't let

335
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:33,251
any of you go downstairs.

336
00:45:34,377 --> 00:45:35,462
I see.

337
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:37,380
You're pretty tough.

338
00:45:38,506 --> 00:45:40,592
But you don't seem
to get the picture here.

339
00:45:40,675 --> 00:45:44,220
I'll kill you slowly,
as many times as you want.

340
00:46:04,741 --> 00:46:07,035
You crossed the line this time, Jung-seop.

341
00:46:34,813 --> 00:46:35,855
Do you want that, too?

342
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:38,274
No, I don't…

343
00:46:38,775 --> 00:46:40,026
I don't want that.

344
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:46,324
Thank you.

345
00:46:58,545 --> 00:46:59,963
I like that look on your face.

346
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:02,131
It's nice to meet you.

347

SPECIAL INFECTEE REPORT GUIDE

348
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:44,883
It must hurt.

349
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,593
I know how it feels.

350
00:47:48,303 --> 00:47:49,888
You can never get used to it.

351
00:47:50,847 --> 00:47:52,181
Why did you kill him?

352
00:47:52,765 --> 00:47:54,142
I thought you'd be grateful.

353
00:47:54,225 --> 00:47:55,518
You were on the same side.

354
00:47:59,355 --> 00:48:02,609
How can a wolf and a rabbit
be on the same side?

355
00:48:02,692 --> 00:48:05,445
The rabbit was pretending to be
a wolf, so I just played along.

356
00:48:10,575 --> 00:48:12,619
But there's no need for that now.

357
00:48:13,786 --> 00:48:16,539
It's not a crime for a wolf
to kill a rabbit after playing with it.

358
00:48:17,165 --> 00:48:19,375
That's just natural in this world now.

359
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:22,337
There are monsters that don't…

360
00:48:24,505 --> 00:48:25,465
harm humans.

361
00:48:38,102 --> 00:48:39,395
Why are you alone?

362
00:48:40,063 --> 00:48:40,939
Where's Hyun-su?

363
00:48:41,856 --> 00:48:44,150
We don't have time for this!

364
00:48:44,233 --> 00:48:45,652
What do you mean?

365
00:48:45,735 --> 00:48:48,029
If they come down, we're all dead!

366
00:48:48,112 --> 00:48:49,238
What are you talking about?

367
00:48:49,322 --> 00:48:50,907
Damn it.

368
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,784
Let's all survive together, okay?

369
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,713
I've never seen such a thing before.

370
00:49:09,175 --> 00:49:11,386
It can't kill anything in this state.

371
00:49:11,928 --> 00:49:15,306
Okay, I can see that there's a monster
that doesn't harm humans.

372
00:49:28,611 --> 00:49:31,447
But will there be humans
that don't harm monsters?

373
00:49:37,286 --> 00:49:38,371
Take a look at this.

378

you're trying to protect
