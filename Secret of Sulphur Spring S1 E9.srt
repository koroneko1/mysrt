00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,057
<i>I've always wondered...</i>

158
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,225
<i>what made you fall in love with Dad?</i>

159
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,395
<i>Well, a lot of things,</i>

160
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,397
<i>but mostly because...</i>

161
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,316
<i>he could make me laugh like no one else.</i>

162
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,404
<i>He also knew
exactly what to say to tick me off.</i>

163
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,906
<i>(chuckles)
He used to love pushing my buttons.</i>

164
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,826
<i>Kinda like someone else I know.</i>

165
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,245
<i>How did you meet?</i>

166
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,040
<i>(sighs)
When we were kids...</i>

167
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,293
<i>at Camp Tremont,believe it or not.</i>

168
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,922
<i>Guess you could say,
he was the one good thing to come out of that place.</i>

169
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,716
<i>Really?
That long ago?</i>

170
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,718
<i>It was the last day.</i>

171
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,387
<i>I was going home,and my duffel was huge.</i>

172
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,054
<i>He offered to help.</i>

173
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,975
<i>(chuckles)
Darn thing must've weighed more than he did.</i>

174
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,437
<i>He had this goofy grin
on his face,</i>

175
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,731
<i>and he stuck his hand out
and he said,</i>

176
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,190
<i>"Hi, I'm Chris."</i>

177
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,569
<i>His voice broke.
I remember it so clearly.</i>

178
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,029
<i>We just laughed.</i>

179
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,037
<i>I'm sorry I haven't talked
more about your father.</i>

180
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,665
<i>It's just‐‐</i>

181
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,376
<i>After the accident,
when we lost him,</i>

182
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,004
<i>I... didn't know what to say...</i>

183
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:08,840
<i>to anyone.</i>

184
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,762
<i>You guys became my rock.</i>

185
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,391
<i>And I love you both so much.</i>

186
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,733
<i>[Sarah]
I'm sorry, Ben.
It's just too much.</i>

187
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,234
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

188
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,652
<i>Ben: Do what?
What are you talking about?</i>

189
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,779
<i>[Sarah]
What do you think?</i>

190
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,238
<i>I've had enough.
I'm done.</i>

191
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,366
<i>The kids and I are moving back to Chicago.</i>

192
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,534
<i>[Ben]
Okay, wait.</i>

193
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,119
<i>I know it seems like
nothing's going right</i>

194
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,871
<i>since we moved here.
[Sarah] Seems like?</i>

195
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,915
<i>That's an understatement.</i>

196
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,792
<i>Look, Ben, I've tried,</i>

197
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,461
<i>but I'm starting to believe
this place really is haunted.</i>

198
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,548
<i>Fine, then we'll fix it.
We'll bring someone in or‐‐</i>

199
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,550
<i>No. This ends now.</i>

200
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,594
<i>The secrets,</i>

201
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,596
<i>the conversations with Jess.</i>

202
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,015
<i>I mean, you lied to me
about knowing Savannah.</i>

203
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,183
<i>What else are you hiding?</i>

204
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,435
<i>(sighs)</i>

205
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,403
<i>Wait, Dad told you he knew Savannah?</i>

206
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,198
<i>Griff, uh...</i>

207
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,866
<i>Just go to bed.</i>

208
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,477
<i>You are two hours early.</i>

209
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,813
<i>Yes! I thought I'd get a jump
on the day.</i>

210
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,857
<i>By breaking and entering?</i>

211
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,192
<i>So I could do some extra research</i>

212
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,694
<i>for a history project.
Mm‐hmm?</i>

213
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,071
<i>What's this project about?</i>

214
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,990
<i>The Great Storm of 1960.
Oh.</i>

215
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,241
<i>The internet has a zillion links</i>

216
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,325
<i>but not enough pictures.</i>

217
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,912
<i>But lucky for you,
before there was the internet,</i>

218
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,581
<i>before there were laptops,</i>

219
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>there was this neat little thing</i>

220
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,418
<i>called microfilm.</i>

221
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,336
<i>Newspapers, periodicals,</i>

222
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,630
<i>all squeezed down into these little rolls.</i>

223
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,717
<i>The school has some?
Oh, going way, way back.</i>

224
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,888
<i>The Great Storm of 1960...</i>

225
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,098
<i>Uh, you may or may not know,</i>

226
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,602
<i>but I am an expert
on local history and lore.</i>

227
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,769
<i>So you remember it?</i>

228
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,982
<i>1960?
Honey, do I look that old?</i>

229
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,985
<i>I know of it and about it.</i>

230
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,737
<i>But I'll tell you this,</i>

231
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,990
<i>that storm changed a lot of lives in this town.</i>

232
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,542
<i>Is Dad back?</i>

233
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,961
<i>[Sarah]
 Not yet.</i>

234
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,005
<i>Zoey? Wyatt?
Breakfast.</i>

235
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,218
<i>Have you tried calling him yet?</i>

236
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,179
<i>I'm sure your dad will be home soon.</i>

237
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,513
<i>Just sit. Eat.</i>

238
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,269
<i>He... He seemed pretty upset last night.</i>

239
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,480
<i>I mean, you both did.</i>

240
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,732
<i>Everything will be fine
once we're back in Chicago.</i>

241
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,858
<i>Wait, that's definite?</i>

242
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,778
<i>Yeah, I thought you'd be excited.</i>

243
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,947
<i>Well... Yeah, but...</i>

244
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,450
<i>things have changed now.Kinda like it here.</i>

245
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,787
<i>Because of Harper?
And you know...</i>

246
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,288
<i>all of it.</i>

247
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,166
<i>Well, it's what's best for this family.</i>

248
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,919
<i>It'll all work out.</i>

249
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,796
<i>Exactly what you said when we moved in.</i>

250
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,714
<i>And it almost did.</i>

251
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,342
<i>After you eat, you need
to start packing up your room.</i>

252
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,970
<i>Now?
What about school?</i>

253
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,846
<i>I already called and told 'em
you're not coming.</i>

254
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,306
<i>You'll start back
at your old school next week.</i>

255
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,099
<i>No, but I‐‐
Hey!</i>

256
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,518
<i>Just pack.</i>

257
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,270
<i>Wyatt? Zoey?</i>

258
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,866
<i>Still at it?
Uh‐huh.</i>

259
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,287
<i>Mrs. Douglas:
1962?</i>

260
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,080
<i>I thought you were researching the storm.</i>

261
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,083
<i>Yes, but I'm also interested
in how the community rebuilt.</i>

262
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,876
<i>Like what happened to people.</i>

263
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,586
<i>Some moved away.
Some stayed.</i>

264
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,589
<i>You've developed quite a passion</i>

265
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,216
<i>for Sulphur Springs history.</i>

266
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,678
<i>Yes, it's just fun
to imagine what it was like,</i>

267
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,762
<i>being a kid back then.</i>

268
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,142
<i>Well, finish up.
Classes are about to start.</i>

269
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,730
<i>Savannah.</i>

270
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,113
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

271
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,908
<i>Griffin, what's going on?
Why aren't you at school?</i>

272
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,577
Trust me,it's not my choice.

273
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,995
<i>What's up?</i>

274
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,204
[Harper]
Amazing news.

275
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,456
<i>You're not gonna believe this.</i>

276
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,123
<i>Look!</i>

277
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,043
<i>Whoa!</i>

278
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,711
<i>Is that Savannah?</i>

279
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,922
<i>At the grand re‐opening
of The Tremont in 1962.</i>

280
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,549
That's two years
after the storm.

281
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,508
<i>Exactly.</i>

282
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,554
That's great.
I know, right?

283
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,431
Okay, give me a few minutes
and I'll be right over.

284
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,599
<i>What?</i>

285
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,225
<i>Wait. No, no. I‐‐</i>

286
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,352
<i>Griffin, we have to go back. Now.</i>

287
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,730
I know, and I would,

288
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,440
but I, uh‐‐ If you're grounded,
it's fine.

289
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,400
We'll just figure out‐‐Harper, my family's moving.

290
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,027
<i>What?</i>

291
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,488
<i>We're going back to Chicago.</i>

292
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,032
<i>But that's crazy.
You literally just got here.</i>

293
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,241
Oh, you thinkI don't know that?

294
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,036
Sorry, it's just‐‐

295
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,165
<i>My dad told my mom that he lied,</i>

296
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,666
<i>that he did know Savannah as a kid.</i>

297
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,252
Oh.

298
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,837
They had this huge fight last night,

299
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,756
and my dad left,

300
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,549
and he hasn't come back yet.

301
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,967
<i>So as soon as he does,</i>

302
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,261
<i>we're moving.</i>

303
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,054
<i>Forever.</i>

304
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,056
<i>This is so messed up.</i>

305
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,309
<i>Yeah, tell me about it.
[Zoey] Griffin!</i>

306
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,729
We need more boxes from the garage.

307
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,647
[Sarah]
Griffin.

308
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,148
I‐‐I gotta go.
Wait.

00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,205
<i>Is Ben with you?</i>

313
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,208
Excuse me?
Ben.

314
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,001
<i>Is he there?</i>

315
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,045
<i>No. Why would he be?</i>

316
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,130
You're friends.

317
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,549
<i>Were friends.</i>

318
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,552
<i>And, uh...</i>

319
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,304
<i>you seem to know a lot about each other.</i>

320
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,101
<i>What's wrong, Sarah?
You can't find him?</i>

321
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,565
<i>Um... No.</i>

322
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,525
Look, I'm‐‐ I'm sorry I bothered you.

323
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,067
<i>Wait.</i>

324
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,778
<i>There is a place.</i>

325
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,613
It's a long shot,

326
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,823
<i>but it's somewhere he used to go.</i>

327
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,623
<i>Why aren't you guys packing?</i>

328
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,834
<i>We're on strike.
We don't want to move.</i>

329
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,502
<i>Chicago will seem boring now.</i>

330
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,962
<i>No ghosts.</i>

331
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,048
<i>Thought you guys were scared of ghosts.</i>

332
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,176
<i>We were, but now
we're kind of into hunting them.</i>

333
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,927
<i>You know Mom thinks she saw one.</i>

334
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,012
<i>And we heard the singing.</i>

335
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:11,888
<i>What‐‐</i>

336
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,348
<i>What singing?</i>

337
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,224
<i>The girl on the tape.</i>

338
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,018
<i>In the boarded‐up room?</i>

339
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,021
<i>That's impossible.Are you sure?</i>

340
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,981
<i>Yeah, freaked out Dad too.</i>

341
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
<i>Maybe that's why we're moving.</i>

342
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,069
<i>Hey.</i>

343
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,448
<i>(clears throat)</i>

344
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,160
<i>We should go.</i>

345
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,204
<i>The lovebirds probably
need some alone time.</i>

346
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,622
<i>To do what?</i>

347
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,832
<i>Oh.</i>

348
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,584
<i>(imitates kissing)</i>

349
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,755
<i>Wow.</i>

350
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:46,964
<i>So this is really happening.</i>

351
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,300
<i>(sighs)
Yup.</i>

352
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,260
<i>My mom wants us to leave
as soon as we're packed.</i>

353
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,180
<i>See, all this stuff with our parents</i>

354
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,139
<i>is just...</i>

355
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,308
<i>Last night,
I couldn't stop thinking,</i>

356
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,517
<i>if we could just find Savannah...</i>

357
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,727
<i>You could stay.</i>

358
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,520
<i>Yeah.</i>

359
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,898
<i>Okay, so we've got a few minutes.</i>

360
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,067
<i>Maybe there's something we're missing.</i>

361
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,195
<i>Like what?
Savannah's in 1962,</i>

362
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,573
<i>and the portal only takes us back
30 years at a time, so...</i>

363
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,243
<i>Unless you want to go back to 1960
and wait two years‐‐</i>

364
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,078
<i>Of course not, but...</i>

365
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,038
<i>maybe there's a way to control it.</i>

366
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,790
<i>And as long as she's alive,
there's hope, right?</i>

367
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,042
<i>What?</i>

368
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:24,961
<i>The thing is...</i>

369
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,713
<i>if Savannah was alive,</i>

370
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,257
<i>she wouldn't be a ghost.</i>

371
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,175
<i>She wouldn't still be
haunting The Tremont,</i>

372
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,677
<i>but... she is.</i>

373
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,928
<i>She is?</i>

374
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,930
<i>How do you know?</i>

375
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,348
<i>There's something I need to show you.</i>

376
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,474
<i>Come on.</i>

377
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,441
<i>[Sarah]
Get any sleep last night?</i>

378
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,363
<i>Not much.</i>

379
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,156
<i>Me neither.</i>

380
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,620
<i>I'm sorry I walked out like that.</i>

381
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,759
<i>I love you.</i>

382
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,971
<i>And you can tell me anything.</i>

383
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,648
<i>We were in camp here together.</i>

384
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,235
<i>Me, Jess, and Savannah.</i>

385
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,281
<i>Back then around the campfire,
the scariest ghost stories</i>

386
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,490
<i>were about the basement in the hotel.</i>

387
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,537
<i>So one night...</i>

388
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,166
<i>Jess dared Savannah to stay down there...</i>

389
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,459
<i>till morning.</i>

390
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,005
<i>I thought I'd convinced her...</i>

391
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,132
<i>not to do it.</i>

392
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,135
<i>We camped out...</i>

393
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,262
<i>up there.</i>

394
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,556
<i>The tree house.</i>

395
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,024
<i>But after I fell asleep...</i>

396
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,570
<i>she snuck out.</i>

397
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,532
<i>To go to the basement?
Yeah.</i>

398
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,668
So I did too.
Ben.

399
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,003
[Ben]
It was dark and creepy,

400
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,506
but we told each other jokes

401
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,216
and tried to laugh
our way through it.

402
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,886
We were fine until we heard a noise.

403
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,722
It was all around us.

404
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,265
I took off.

405
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,354
I thought she followed,but she didn't.

406
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,356
She stayed.

407
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,487
<i>And I didn't know...</i>

408
00:19:58,656 --> 00:19:59,907
<i>till the next morning.</i>

409
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,118
<i>The police were there.</i>

410
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,328
<i>Search parties.</i>

411
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,793
<i>Kind of like today.</i>

412
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,173
<i>You were just a kid.</i>

413
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,594
<i>The only kid who could have
saved her life.</i>

414
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,312
<i>Griff was right.
(sniffles)</i>

415
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,566
<i>He said I came here
to make bad memories better.</i>

416
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,069
<i>But the truth is I can't...</i>

417
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,779
<i>and never will.</i>

418
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,825
<i>Savannah is gone</i>

419
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,493
<i>'cause I ran away.</i>

420
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,166
<i>So this is where the singing came from,</i>

421
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,752
<i>an unplugged tape machine.</i>

422
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,880
<i>Yesterday,which means...</i>

423
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,715
<i>She's still a ghost.</i>

424
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,592
<i>(buzzing)</i>

425
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,845
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

426
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,138
<i>It looks like the radio in the bunker.</i>

427
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,985
<i>[Griffin]
Whatever this is,</i>

428
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,195
<i>it doesn't look like it belongs.</i>

429
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,826
<i>No, won't budge.
Let me try.</i>

430
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,755
<i>A code?
Maybe.</i>

431
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,882
<i>Or a combination.</i>

432
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,343
<i>Let's find out.</i>

433
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,145
<i>(grunts)</i>

434
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,939
<i>There has to be a screwdriver here.</i>

435
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,071
<i>Here.
Thank you.</i>

436
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,703
<i>Bingo.</i>

437
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,082
<i>Go ahead. Dial it to the same numbers
from the one upstairs.</i>

438
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,250
<i>Me?</i>

439
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,001
<i>Yeah. It seems to respond to you.</i>

440
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,352
<i>(buzzing)</i>

441
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,186
<i>(button pops)</i>

442
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,315
<i>This is really weird.
Yeah, no kidding.</i>

443
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,277
<i>What do you think it wants us to do?</i>

444
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,153
<i>First of all,
I don't think it's an "it."</i>

445
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,156
<i>It's her.
It's Savannah.</i>

446
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,825
<i>And she's trying to help us find her.</i>

447
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,785
<i>(intense music playing)</i>

448
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,415
[Griffin]
Next time on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

449
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,458
<i>Maybe this little dial...
Choose any year.</i>

450
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,626
<i>[Harper]
Try 1962.</i>

451
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,253
That picture I found of Savannah,

452
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,462
that's the year it was taken.

453
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,089
<i>What if something goes wrong again?</i>

454
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,966
I can be stuck there forever.

455
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,467
[Zoey]
This is crazy.

456
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,052
<i>A wall of cold spots and now...</i>

457
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,388
<i>No. No frost.</i>

458
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,765
<i>You don't think Savannah's hiding, do you?</i>

459
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,726
<i>What if she finally got what she wanted?</i>

460
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,561
<i>Mr. Campbell,you have to come quick.</i>

461
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:16,979
<i>What's wrong?
It's Griffin.</i>

462
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,147
<i>He fell.</i>
