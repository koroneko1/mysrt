1
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,510
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

2
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,388
EVENTS, AND OCCUPATIONS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,565
-Are you sure it's going to rain?
-Of course.

4
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,776
Trust me when it comes to weather.

5
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,236
My friend works
at the Meteorological Administration,

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,030
and even he asks me about the weather.

7
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,452
I'm more accurate than them.

8
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,795
I hope it rains a lot.

9
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,342
It'd be awesome if I can guess
the amount of rainfall too.

10
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:38,556
But if the infected break in,
we'd be attacked first, right?

11
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:43,353
That still doesn't mean
you can go into someone else's house.

12
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:49,651
Excuse me, you two. Please hear us out.

13
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,574
The second floor is dangerous.

14
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,993
Once the lobby is breached,
it'll be our house next.

15
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,621
So we want to move to that house.

16
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,123
Please tell her it's okay.

17
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,253
Some jerk dumped food waste
on the first floor, so it reeks.

18
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:12,090
You just needed to talk to me,
the building representative.

19
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,759
You're saying you want to move
to the 11th floor.

20
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,636
But isn't it locked?

21
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,639
We cleaned Unit 1102, not long ago.

22
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,808
The passcode is 8888. It hasn't changed.

23
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:25,019
We will clean the place
when we get out in three days.

24
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,189
So, are you against this,
building representative?

25
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,568
There can be legal problems later on…

26
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,611
And the 11th floor is a royal floor,

27
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,865
so it doesn't look good
to let the cleaners live there.

28
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,950
The residents won't like it.

29
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,244
Then let's hear their opinions.

30
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,872
We have a lawyer in the building too.

31
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:48,167
I'd like to say it's not possible,
from a lawyer's point of view.

32
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,838
If you go into someone else's house
without permission, it's trespassing.

33
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,132
If two people go in,
it's special trespassing.

34
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,384
It's not an offense unpunishable
over objection,

35
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,970
so anyone can report it,
even if they're not the owners.

36
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,222
You know…

37
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,476
I'm really sorry to say this, but…

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,689
If you two go up,

39
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,692
then our house will be at the lowest.

40
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,986
Why should we guard your house, sir?

41
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,072
Hey, don't look at me like that!

42
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,826
My house has two old people.

43
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,832
Can't you young people stay at the bottom
and help us feel safe?

44
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,042
Hey!

45
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:36,507
Mr. Oh, since you came all the way here,
tell us if you have any opinions.

46
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,720
I think you should just stay here.

47
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:45,350
If you can stay here like a guard dog,

48
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,603
the residents would feel safe,
and it'll be good.

49
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,896
What are you saying?

50
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,564
-What did you say?
-Calm down.

51
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,899
Don't.

52
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,526
Just calm down, and do the cleaning.

53
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,575
Now, it won't be longer than three days.

54
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,786
Let's endure it a bit longer.

55
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:10,208
Everyone's already having a hard time,
so we can't give privileges only to you.

56
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,877
More than that,
where should we throw out the trash?

57
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,880
We left it at the emergency stairs,
but it still stinks a bit.

58
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,261
Don't tell me

59
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,097
you threw it out the window.

60
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,475
Did someone really do that?

61
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,810
I hope not.

62
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:35,024
If you need more water,
put water containers on the rooftop.

63
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,902
I already told Unit 401,
but it'll rain tonight.

64
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,072
How do you know that?
Is the Internet working?

65
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,910
He's the human weather center.

66
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,830
He could've gone to the Major League,
but he had a knee injury…

67
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,332
-That's an exaggeration…
-Oh, dear.

68
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,210
That's too bad for a young man like you.

69
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:59,007
Do some thigh workouts regularly!

70
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,966
Yes.

71
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,010
I should.

72
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,470
Work out, okay?

73
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,099
Excuse me.

74
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,685
I have something to tell you.

75
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,814
It's my brother.

76
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,621
My brother isn't here.

77
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,792
Right? He's not here.

78
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,213
I was just worried.

79
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,143
My brother called me.

80
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,064
Through that yesterday,
before the electricity was cut off.

81
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,817
He looked fine, but…

82
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,987
He had a strong immune system
when he was a kid,

83
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,073
and he doesn't catch colds that easily.

84
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:10,203
Maybe… he's not infected.

85
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,919
I hope he isn't.

86
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,239
You really are the human weather center.

87
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,700
See? I told you it'll rain.

88
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,245
Get some more sleep. I'll go.

89
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,663
No, I'm awake.

90
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,291
I should go get water to flush the toilet.
It's been bothering me.

91
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,293
And I should put the container back out.

92
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,337
We never know when it might rain again.

93
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,257
When will it rain?

94
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,301
It's raining now.

95
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,428
Evil, begone!

96
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,766
He's driving me crazy, seriously…

97
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,942
What is this?

98
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,694
He's suddenly religious now.

99
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,071
He even prays before he sleeps.

100
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,783
Does he even know how to pray?

101
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,120
Let's just go to the rooftop.

102
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,336
Evil, begone!

103
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,558
It's raining.

104
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,895
Shall I go outside and get some water?

105
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,692
Heavy metals, fine dust, and pollutants…

106
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,777
I will never drink rainwater.

107
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,946
And I will never drink
the bathtub water, either.

108
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,783
We'll be able to go out in three days.
What's with you?

109
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,287
We never know.

110
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,289
Soo-min!

111
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,458
-Oh, gosh.
-Soo-min!

112
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,211
Soo-min!

113
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,131
-Is that you, Soo-min?
-Hyun-kyung…

114
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,300
What are you doing here?

115
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,303
Wait, no. Go away!

116
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,847
Wait, don't go! Let's talk.

117
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,029
Are you hurt badly?

118
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,617
Are you sure that you got the disease?

119
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,494
I'm not sure.

120
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:46,377
I just… feel weird.

121
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,088
What about food? Did you eat anything?

122
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,563
Excuse me.

123
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,606
Isn't that ours?

124
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,609
Don't you have water at home?

125
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,364
Drinking our water without asking…

126
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,908
Come on. Rainwater is free.

127
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,785
You can drink more if you want to.

128
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,919
Hey, you shouldn't just drink that.

129
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,797
It's okay.

130
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,051
I always drank muddy water
during tactical training, you know.

131
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,312
UNIT 1501 KIM SE-HOON

132
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,316
I'm sure no one will steal your water.

133
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,527
Do you drink rainwater too?

134
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,695
By purifying it.

135
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,158
I have purifying tablets,
so come over if you need any.

136
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,120
And tell your husband before you do.

137
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,462
I'll be the one going to his house.

138
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,172
Never go there on your own.

139
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,965
Don't worry.

140
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,135
He even drinks rainwater by purifying it,

141
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,596
so I'm sure he didn't take drugs
from the gym.

142
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,642
What do you want for dinner?

143
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,894
But we just ate.

144
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,897
I think of tomorrow's breakfast menu
while I eat today's lunch.

145
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,608
Then it's more delicious
due to my expectations.

146
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,570
-Hi.
-Hi.

147
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,364
Are you cleaning these days too?

148
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,534
It felt stifling just to stay at home.

149
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,870
The building representative
also told me to work

150
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,539
if I want to get paid.

151
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,167
She really is mean.

152
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,045
But I saw something weird.

153
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,672
Like what?

154
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,268
Where did you find this?

155
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,728
In a trash bag.

156
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,985
They didn't even fill up
half the trash bag.

157
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,780
It must be someone
with lots of trash bags.

158
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,700
What is this?

159
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,910
Where was that trash bag?

160
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,288
Between the third and fourth floor.

161
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,918
But it was fine until yesterday.

162
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,962
Don't show it.

163
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,548
Since I'm a detective,
I'll use an advanced technique

164
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,258
to interrogate her.

165
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,053
Speak nicely.
I'm sure she's still shocked.

166
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,805
Don't worry.

167
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,437
Hi.

168
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,485
Are you short on anything
or having other issues?

169
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,236
Not yet.

170
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,405
What brings you here?

171
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,451
We're here about the trash.

172
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,670
You threw this away, didn't you?

173
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,088
No.

174
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,841
I'm not injured. I mean it.

175
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,428
-See? I'm fine, aren't I?
-It's okay.

176
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,640
I didn't get bitten. I really am fine.

177
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,939
An advanced investigation technique?

178
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,566
Seriously…

179
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,902
Hey, it's better to ask directly first.

180
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,366
I don't think it was Ms. Na.

181
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,332
Her brother…

182
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,045
Where could he be now?

183
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:11,016
But why did you bring me
instead of Sae-bom?

184
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,394
You said you can't lend me your gun.

185
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:18,482
Sorry, I feel anxious without my gun.

186
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,317
That's why you're here.

187
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,592
EMERGENCY RELIEF GOODS

188
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,677
That's one of the boxed lunches
we gave out.

189
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,846
Why is that here?

190
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,265
Martial Law has been declared.

191
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,267
It's filled with the infected outside.

192
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,394
So?

193
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,147
Do we have to know everything
that's happening inside?

194
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,442
-There may be more infected people inside.
-And if we find them?

195
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,611
What will we do then?

196
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,322
Where would we lock them up?
We're locked in here too.

197
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,868
Yi-hyun, we can get out in two days.

198
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,580
Let's not stir up things
by investigating stuff, okay?

199
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,000
We never know. What if more people
get bitten one by one and get infected?

200
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,877
My wife…

201
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,504
is badly ill right now.

202
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,507
She got tested for breast cancer,

203
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,843
and it seems like it recurred.

204
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,554
We got a call from the hospital.

205
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,477
We started our shop
because we thought she was cured.

206
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,854
Yi-hyun.

207
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,066
I need to go to my wife.

208
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:47,404
You know how much my wife suffered, right?

209
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,204
Jung-kook is right.

210
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,250
There isn't much we can do.

211
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,806
Give me the whole thing.

212
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:24,233
Okay. Let's wait until
the disease control team comes.

213
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,778
Okay.

214
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,544
I don't think I can wait.

215
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,132
Among the candidate materials
for the cure,

216
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,426
Material 13 proved effective
in the clinical test.

217
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,177
How effective is it?

218
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,681
The period and frequency
of disease occurrence

219
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,308
improved for 72% of
the infected in serious conditions.

220
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,285
How's your thirst?

221
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,495
I don't feel it that much.

222
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,039
-What about my family?
-They're outside, nice and safe.

223
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,584
Lieutenant Colonel, not yet…

224
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,259
By the way…

225
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,845
did you always like meat?

226
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,513
No.

227
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,058
I was a vegetarian, but…

228
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,146
It looks like you've gotten a lot better.

229
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,032
Don't worry about your family
and just focus on recovering.

230
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,671
Yoon Sae-bom's blood analysis
isn't complete yet, is it?

231
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,714
No, it isn't.

232
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,467
Do the analysis in secret,

233
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,220
and leak the info
on Material 13 to the higher-ups.

234
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,932
But it's still at an early clinical stage.
We need more data.

235
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,600
That's why we're doing this.

236
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,104
Say that the clinical tests are over
and that only the final stage remains.

237
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,165
What did you do in there?

238
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,667
What?

239
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:37,050
It was nothing.
I was just feeling a bit stuffy,

240
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,428
and I heard this place was empty,

241
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,014
-I should try going in there too--
-Wait.

242
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,899
I'm sorry.

243
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,483
My brother is in there.

244
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,624
Mr. Na, are you in there?

245
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,292
Are you okay?

246
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,797
It's okay, Soo-min. You can talk to them.

247
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,008
They're my upstairs neighbors.

248
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,970
Yes, for now.

249
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,015
You ate a boxed lunch
at the basement entrance, right?

250
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,142
Did your sister give that to you?

251
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,647
No. The doctor from the sixth floor did.

252
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,733
He knew…

253
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,861
that I got infected.

254
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,705
Aren't you hungry?

255
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,646
What did Mr. Oh say?

256
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,358
He asked me to come inside with him,

257
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,694
but I refused.

258
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,741
Then he told me to think about it,
gave me a boxed lunch, and left.

259
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,662
Why did you refuse?
I'm sure you wanted to come inside.

260
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,455
I was scared…

261
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,501
that I might bite people.

262
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,972
Please stay home even
after the lockdown is over tomorrow.

263
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:51,101
-Okay.
-Both you and your brother.

264
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:55,439
We'll go out, explain the situation,
and bring the medical staff.

265
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,443
Thank you for understanding.

266
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,738
It's not because we understand.
We just have no choice.

267
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,948
We can't kick you out anywhere.

268
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,577
Still, we appreciate it.

269
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,203
Thank you so much.

270
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,559
Bo-ram.

271
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,686
Come here for a second.

272
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,438
Just one second.

273
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,828
-Bo-ram.
-I'm telling you,

274
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,623
I won't take your money, so don't worry.

275
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,585
-I don't want to get involved anyway.
-No, that's not why…

276
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,546
You heard the thumping last night, right?

277
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,967
That's the sound made by the infected.

278
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,640
I think it was my mom.
I saw a selfie she took.

279
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,141
She had a wound on her back.

280
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:17,270
She said she bumped into
some infected woman on the sixth floor.

281
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,355
So?

282
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,940
What do you mean, "so"?

283
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,984
If my mom is infected,
then we can get infected too.

284
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,530
Wait, are you scared of that?

285
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,906
Not worried about her?

286
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,077
If you're that scared,
lock the door and don't come out.

287
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,373
That's not why. I'm worried about you.

288
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,916
Worry about me? Come on.

289
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,876
Just be nice to your parents.

290
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,879
I would give anything
to have parents like them.

291
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,393
When the lockdown is over tomorrow,

292
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,311
I should go see my mom first.

293
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,358
First Lieutenant Lee
said she's being protected, but…

294
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,360
She'll be fine.

295
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,946
I didn't expect to meet my mom like this.

296
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,953
Would the US be okay?

297
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,455
Hey, we're lucky
that we didn't schedule a wedding.

298
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,167
Right? If this broke out
while she was on her way here…

299
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,960
I would've been a bad son.

300
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,427
Do you think we did a good thing?

301
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,014
You mean the marriage?
Of course, it's a good thing.

302
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,891
No, I mean the fourth floor.

303
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,350
Oh, Mr. Na?

304
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,687
Well, his condition didn't look that bad.

305
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,107
-Maybe since he's at an early stage?
-Lieutenant Colonel Han said

306
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,693
the thirst can be controlled
if the person has the will.

307
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,822
Then I'll never get infected.
I'm a very determined man.

308
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,242
I'm looking forward to it.

309
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,539
What is this?

310
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,458
Is this food?

311
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,792
Indigestion meds.

312
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,462
I had a stomachache
whenever I was nervous about my game.

313
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,797
So I bought that
during the Italian Championships,

314
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,633
but it's disgusting, so don't take it.

315
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:14,304
I've never taken
any indigestion relievers in my life.

316
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,723
I envy you.

317
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,981
I can eat all the food here, you know.

318
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,527
-It's a lot.
-It is.

319
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,322
It includes portions for Seo-yoon too.

320
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,991
This is what we have
even after we gave food to everyone.

321
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,995
Let's put them back
when the lockdown is over tomorrow.

322
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,124
What if the lockdown
isn't lifted tomorrow?

323
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,586
We can eat those and wait.

324
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,506
You said you're very determined.

325
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,931
Thank you so much.

326
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,841
OUT OF CALL RANGE
NOT A SERVICE AREA

327
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,069
Mr. Kim.

328
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,281
Do you want to go outside,
or stay here with Seo-yoon?

329
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,950
Well…

330
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,621
Someone should stay with Seo-yoon, right?

331
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,041
Then let me borrow your gun.

332
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,671
Sae-bom.

333
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,175
I'm having a hard time these days.

334
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,929
Okay, you can keep it with you.

335
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,849
I asked you just in case.

336
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:28,605
Sae-bom, the phone's still not working.
Is it going to be okay?

337
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,106
Of course.

338
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,858
Stay home with Mr. Kim.

339
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,902
I'll go out and check the situation.

340
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,781
If you think you'll get hurt,
you have to run.

341
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,658
Don't worry. I have a good hunch
about things like that.

342
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,335
Hi.

343
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,339
What is this?

344
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,757
It was here when I got here.

345
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,385
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH SO MUCH
UNTIL THE END

346
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,766
I didn't know
there was someone so nice here.

347
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,559
This person must have a lot of water.

348
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,062
It must be the young lady
on the fourth floor.

349
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,272
She is kind and generous.

350
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,821
Did you live well on the third floor?
After you almost got us all killed?

351
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,656
I'm sorry.

352
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,832
What is this?

353
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,334
This is like an oasis in a desert. Nice.

354
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,003
Did you prepare this,
building representative?

355
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,884
You all went through a lot.

356
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,598
Can I drink more than one?

357
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,852
Yes, go ahead.

358
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,820
Here.

359
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,700
Take it. We're neighbors, after all.

360
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,372
But when will the doors be opened?

361
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,461
Let's go outside and check.
Who wants to go outside with me?

362
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,346
Let's go.

363
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,942
We'll have to go outside to find out.

364
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,278
Hey, don't drink it.

365
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,531
We never know
if someone put something in it.

366
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,033
No way.

367
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,452
Hey!

368
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,044
Seriously…

369
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,846
Are we out too early?

370
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,814
This is not a drill.

371
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,318
Citizens, this is not a drill.

372
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,280
Martial Law, originally scheduled
to be lifted today,

373
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,824
has been extended indefinitely as of now.

374
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,118
I repeat.

375
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,580
Martial Law, originally scheduled
to be lifted today,

376
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,999
-has been extended indefinitely…
-Oh, Lord.

377
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,959
-Why?
-Lord!

378
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,753
This is not a drill.

379
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,795
No!

380
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,339
I repeat.

381
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,217
Citizens, this is not a drill.

382
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,846
Martial Law, originally scheduled
to be lifted today,

383
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,766
has been extended indefinitely as of now.

384
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,852
I repeat.

385
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,400
This is not a drill.

386
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,321
Citizens, this is not a drill.

387
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,334
Ms. Woo said she needed
legal consulting, so came…

388
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,795
Where's Sang-hee?

389
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,881
She was here. Where did she go?

390
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:48,800
She's there.

391
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,761
You're here.

392
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,598
I suffered a lot from the lockdown.

393
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,392
I wanted to calculate the amount, so…

394
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:00,895
Okay.

395
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,356
Did you hear the announcement?

396
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,400
Yes, we were totally shocked.

397
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,567
Right?

398
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,902
Right.

399
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,990
Is the consultation over?

400
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,492
Yes, it is.

401
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,452
Okay, then…

402
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,037
All right.

403
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,209
If you need anything else,
contact me at any time.

404
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,794
Okay, goodbye.

405
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,878
Goodbye.

406
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,300
Hey, don't drink that.

407
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,388
But you put it out
so you can get along with everyone.

408
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,559
But we can't go out now.

409
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,152
Was he good?

410
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,738
What?

411
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,156
The lawyer.

412
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,159
His legal consultation.

413
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,828
It was so-so.

414
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,974
Where were you? You said you'll stay home.

415
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:22,018
I went to our neighbor's.

416
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,938
I provided consultation for Sang-hee
since the Martial Law would be lifted.

417
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,733
But then they said it won't be lifted.

418
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:32,320
I did it for nothing
when I can't even get paid for it.

419
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,037
What should we do now?

420
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,956
Look here…

421
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,833
Let's just go outside, okay?

422
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,044
We can't stay like this forever.

423
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,297
They extended the Martial Law,
so if we go outside,

424
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,591
we could get shot immediately.

425
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,886
By the way, about the thumping sound
in the building…

426
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,598
It may be from outside, or the basement.

427
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,682
My mom.

428
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,019
I think it's my mom.

429
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,147
My mom has a wound on her back.

430
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,068
I saw a picture of her back that she took.

431
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,403
You mean it?

432
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,530
Dad,

433
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,491
you know something's wrong
with Mom, don't you?

434
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,246
That's psoriasis.

435
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,331
When you get old, your skin gets dry.

436
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,292
It's from her scratching herself.

437
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:33,714
I put that on her back.
What is it called again?

438
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,676
You know, that thing. That…

439
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,969
Moisturizer?

440
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,137
Yes, that. Moisturizer.

441
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,099
I put moisturizer on her.

442
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,100
I saw it too.

443
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,977
She just has dry skin, that's all.

444
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,521
We should go check.

445
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,314
Let's hear them out first.

446
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,317
Don't you come into my house
without permission!

447
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,612
You do what you want to do outside!

448
00:35:56,696 --> 00:36:00,366
My wife and I won't come outside anymore!

449
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,034
Damn you…

450
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,628
We should discuss issues
about necessities.

451
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,922
We have to give out food and necessities

452
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,883
from the second floor to every house.

453
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,467
What are you saying?

454
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,304
What can we eat, then?
Are you telling us to starve to death?

455
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:25,892
To be honest,
they don't even belong to you.

456
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,311
You just took them temporarily.

457
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,813
Hey! How can you say that?

458
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,231
Look here.

459
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,066
We risked our lives to bring those!

460
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,402
Who do you think you are
to just give them out?

461
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,237
You live here for free.

462
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,448
-Why are you shouting?
-What?

463
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,868
You flipped out last time,
going on about the "royal floor."

464
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,996
Will you charge us for breathing here too?
Should we pay for air?

465
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,416
I can't believe my generosity
gets repaid like this.

466
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:54,587
-Generosity?
-Calm down, everyone.

467
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,672
You should've gone outside that day, then.

468
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,175
-Calm down.
-We risked our lives to bring that!

469
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,509
We can't let her…

470
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,012
continue like this.

471
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,222
She'll keep causing fights.

472
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,850
-How can you say that?
-Please calm down.

473
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,693
Young lady.

474
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:24,533
You can't stay here any longer,
so go somewhere else.

475
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:29,288
-But I have nowhere to go.
-Go to the couple at Unit 501.

476
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:34,460
They're nice, so they'll find you
a place to sleep.

477
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,462
Goodbye.

478
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,471
Honey.

479
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:51,310
-Why did they summon people again?
-It's the same thing again.

480
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,228
You…

481
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,818
Just make some food. I'm hungry.

482
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,153
-Where's Dong-hyun?
-That brat…

483
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,074
I'm sure he's somewhere in the building.

484
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,284
Right…

485
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:11,789
There's a vacant unit,
so the supermarket lady will sleep there.

486
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,500
That's good.

487
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,597
I thought we'd be able
to take the elevator now.

488
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,728
I must do something about those cleaners.

489
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,313
They have no manners.

490
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,356
But we can't kick them out.

491
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,448
Wait!

492
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,453
My arm!

493
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,622
What is it?

494
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,917
We have something to discuss.

495
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,089
-Let's talk outside.
-Okay, thank you.

496
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,884
Look here!

497
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,802
What?

498
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,058
We're already inside, so let's talk here,
where it's comfortable.

499
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,733
We're not done cleaning yet.

500
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,153
Are you sure you moved in to live here?

501
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,408
We ordered furniture
and appliances in collections,

502
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,659
but they're not here yet.

503
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,746
Your refrigerator and microwave
are very simple.

504
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,791
We have to live for now, at least.

505
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:40,336
Maybe that's because
you weren't thinking of living here.

506
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,963
This is yours, right?

507
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,010
-No.
-Right here.

508
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:52,264
It says "Muil Group Construction
in Commemoration of Selection," right?

509
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:56,102
They gave them out when it was chosen
to construct this apartment complex.

510
00:39:56,185 --> 00:40:00,648
Everyone who bought
an apartment here has it.

511
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,443
The regular apartments, I mean.

512
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,529
Not those who got it for free.

513
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,656
We know you gave water to Kim Seung-beom.

514
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,701
Who said that?

515
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,744
Your job is to become

516
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,997
the resident representative
and embezzle apartment funds, right?

517
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,792
And Mr. Kim came in here
to help you with that.

518
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,256
Do you have evidence?

519
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,845
Let's go.

520
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,596
Ma'am.

521
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,807
I'll promise you one thing.

522
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,143
You will never become

523
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,020
the resident representative.

524
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,821
The advanced investigation technique!

525
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:49,989
It was pretty good.

526
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,741
See? You should ask directly.

527
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,368
If you don't, they play dumb.

528
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,369
Right.

529
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,788
Mr. Kim.

530
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,456
Are you guys here to pray too?

531
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,833
I don't have a religion.

532
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:01,750
I see.

533
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,795
What about Seo-yoon?

534
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,549
Bo-ram from the supermarket came up,
so I asked her to stay with her.

535
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,136
She said she left the third floor
and had no place to sleep.

536
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,637
-Then Seo-yoon--
-Make it quick.

537
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,931
-Okay, I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

538
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,309
We'll head home first.

539
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,440
What about Bo-ram? Should we tell her
to stay at Unit 502 for a while?

540
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,900
After we ask Seo-yoon first.

541
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,361
That's obviously a cult. I'm worried.

542
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,489
He needs something to depend on, at least.

543
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,574
I did that too
when I couldn't play baseball.

544
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,867
Did you pray too?

545
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,535
No, I did something else.

546
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,958
Do you have drinks?
The ones in plastic bottles.

547
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,835
Not the ones that are high in calories.

548
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,256
Here, give me 50,000 won's worth.

549
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,509
I see you still haven't learned
your lesson.

550
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,344
You jerk…

551
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,553
Just go!

552
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,096
Hey.

553
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,264
Why…

554
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,018
Here. 100,000 won.

555
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,187
You still won't sell them?

556
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,982
It's 200,000 per bottle.

557
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,486
Are you trying to get rich

558
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,656
by selling them
in someone else's apartment?

559
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,865
Why?

560
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,117
Am I not allowed to get rich?

561
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,078
I want to make money and live here too.

562
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,164
You called me a guard dog.

563
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:24,917
Go bring the money.

564
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,001
If you don't want to,

565
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,753
then scram!

566
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,926
Okay, I'll just go bring more money.

567
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:42,810
Did you see how he got scared
and ran away when I barked?

568
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:47,982
What?

569
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,359
Did I do something wrong?

570
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,611
That jerk looked down on me first.

571
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,529
No.

572
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,156
People don't carry
that much cash these days,

573
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,451
-so let's take jewelry as payment too.
-Right.

574
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,830
The building representative
seems like she'd have jewelry, right?

575
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,165
I swear I'll get them from her.

576
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,752
With all that's going on,
we should earn as much money as we can.

577
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,381
We have to send Seung-hui to college too.

578
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,679
Ma'am, listen.

579
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:22,224
You should stop following
the building representative's orders

580
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,310
and clean this place instead, okay?

581
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,354
And we're giving you expensive pastry
and water, so be thankful.

582
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,449
Let the unjust ones commit injustice,

583
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,161
leave the filthy ones filthy,

584
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:46,749
let the just ones practice justice,

585
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,960
and leave the holy…

586
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,254
My arm!

587
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,175
…ones holy.

588
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,343
Amen.

589
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,388
-Amen.
-Amen.

590
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,646
Is Ms. Yoon all right?

591
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,857
-What?
-I saw a wound on her hand.

592
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,027
So I'm worried she might be infected.

593
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:19,948
And it seemed like something was going on
with her and that military man.

594
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:22,910
Right?

595
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,011
We have flash grenades, and…

596
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,890
You got a lot of things.

597
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,642
We have handcuffs too.

598
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,190
And…

599
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,861
What is it? A walkie-talkie?

600
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,614
He said he can't give us guns
and gave us these instead.

601
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,158
How do I turn this thing on?
Hey, turn it on.

602
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,536
So I can find out what's going on outside.

603
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,791
Seo-yoon, you're here. Have some snacks.

604
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,751
Okay.

605
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:16,964
Let's do this later.

606
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,925
If Jung-kook sees this,
I'm sure he'll feel uneasy again.

607
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,762
Did you have a good prayer?

608
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,348
Oh, yes.

609
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,483
Are you worried because you can't get out?

610
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,361
That's not why…

611
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,196
You went outside once

612
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,908
with Han Tae-seok,
and got blood all over your body.

613
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:49,204
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

614
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,497
I'm okay.

615
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,749
This…

616
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,210
When did you get this wound?

617
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,964
I got scratched by my friend…

618
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,300
a while ago.

619
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,844
When you went to the dorm?

620
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,431
Then isn't that an old wound?

621
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,600
It won't heal easily.

622
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,355
Mr. Kim, don't worry too much.

623
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,442
If something happens, I'll tell you first.

624
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,652
Come on, do you think
I'd bite you or Yi-hyun?

625
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:24,990
Okay…

626
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:32,748
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

627
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,667
And what is this one?

628
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,631
What the heck?

629
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:23,840
You got up at this hour?

630
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:24,800
Sir.

631
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,303
Please let me live here.
My mom is infected.

632
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,722
How can I trust you?

633
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,267
Go somewhere else.

634
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,269
I'm really fine.

635
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,062
I was outside all day long.

636
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,605
And look at this.

637
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,109
I'm really fine.

638
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,570
I will clean, do the laundry,
and do everything else.

639
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,196
And I brought food.

640
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,990
I brought all the food we have.

641
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:52,411
You and your wife are really nice people.
You two are very kind.

642
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,496
Please help me.

643
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,542
-Hang on.
-Okay.

644
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,505
When it comes to food,
the more the better.

645
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,174
We don't know how long
we'll have to stay here.

646
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,136
Where would he sleep?
We don't have any extra rooms.

647
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,721
What if he attacks us at night?

648
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,098
-Gosh.
-I'll leave.

649
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,185
Where would you go?

650
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:21,773
I'll go to the fourth floor first.

651
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,776
If that doesn't work,
I'll go to other units.

652
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,777
And in return…

653
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,782
just give me some food.

654
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,681
Ma'am.

655
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,936
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

656
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,772
The other houses may not accept you.

657
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,276
If that doesn't work,
I'll go to the basement lounge.

658
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,237
I think it'll feel better
to stay there alone.

659
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,032
Be careful.

660
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,910
People are getting meaner and nastier.

661
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:27,964
Thank you.

662
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,774
What now?

663
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,276
I found something.

664
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,280
Something you'd be
very happy to hear about.

665
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,121
What did you find here?

666
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,165
Something you need right now.

667
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,458
What's the passcode?

668
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,003
It's 8888.

669
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:16,722
Things are going well
because we're cooperating.

670
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:20,267
What's in there? How do you know
when you don't even know the passcode?

671
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,104
I saw someone
putting something in here secretly.

672
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,605
The ones from the second floor?

673
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,984
Did they hide food in here?

674
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,652
You'll be shocked if you see this.

675
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,239
Did you eat anything?

676
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,468
Who's in there?

677
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,596
I told you, you shouldn't live here!

678
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,354
Mister, who are you?

679
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,064
Let me see your face.

680
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,328
Can anyone hear me out there?

681
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,663
First Lieutenant Lee Ji-soo?

682
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,959
Hey, Han Tae-seok!

683
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,129
I'm sure they didn't give up
on this place.

684
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,757
They probably need time
to organize things.

685
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,554
Right, we might run out of batteries.
Let's try again later.

686
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,770
-Hey.
-Yes?

687
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:50,148
Since we're up here,
tell me about your baseball days.

688
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,734
When I won?

689
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,153
I got in during the third inning…

690
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,905
Not that. Tell me about yourself.

691
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,116
What did you depend on,
if it wasn't a religion?

692
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,620
You said people need something
to depend on.

693
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:12,796
You.

694
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,008
-What?
-To be honest…

695
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,303
I felt totally lost back then.

696
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,223
I acted like I was fine in front of you.

697
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:27,018
But I really thought I was nothing
when I couldn't play baseball anymore.

698
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:31,231
Then after I heard what you said
and fell to the ground…

699
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,652
I thought, "Am I going to die like this?"

700
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,656
And suddenly, my mind was clear.

701
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,661
I realized that it wasn't a big deal.

702
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,581
I found peace in my heart, thanks to you.

703
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,837
Why are you saying that in front of me?
That's embarrassing.

704
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,257
If you're grateful,
then return the favor in secret.

705
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,343
I've always been grateful.

706
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,249
You two are together.

707
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,126
-What's going on?
-Why do you care?

708
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:38,715
Na Soo-min was hiding
in the apartments, infected.

709
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,051
Is it true that you two hid him?

710
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,851
Can I go inside for a second?

711
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,192
Mr. Na.

712
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,736
Can you hear us?

713
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,451
There's no noise,
so I don't think the disease occurred.

714
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,049
Soo-min!

715
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,071
Mr. Na, are you okay?

716
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,623
Please help me.

717
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:58,211
I really didn't bite anyone.

718
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,214
I only looked
at that building representative.

719
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:02,674
I swear.

720
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,679
I have to see my kids.

721
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,853
The infected must be in quarantine, right?

722
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,027
Just hang in there a bit.

723
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,945
We'll check on things and be back soon.

724
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:29,534
Please protect Hyun-kyung
so she won't end up like me.

725
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,912
I didn't make the thumping sound.

726
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,052
It's not too late.

727
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:57,353
You two can be accused of being infected
because you made contact with them.

728
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,690
I also heard you made contact with
someone in the early stages of infection.

729
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,484
We should trust each other and--

730
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,612
You want our support
to become the resident representative?

731
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:11,659
Is this the right time to talk about that?

732
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,369
Then when is the right time?

733
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,082
There's no "right time" in making money.

734
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,049
You know that Oh Joo-hyung
is a lunatic, right?

735
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:32,764
How can you fight Mr. Oh
if you're so soft?

736
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,191
Is Mr. Oh home?

737
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:47,153
You should step outside for a moment.
It won't be a pretty sight.

738
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:57,247
I heard you found Na Soo-min.

739
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,250
I put in some effort
for the safety of the apartment.

740
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,593
Drink a bottle each.

741
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,847
I heard the infected feel more thirsty
when they drink water.

742
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,642
You've been with Mr. Na, so I'm worried.

743
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,521
So you're looking
for the infected among us?

744
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:27,193
Then you should drink too.

745
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,164
Thank goodness.

746
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,834
All three of us are healthy.

747
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,212
You should do something, Detective.

748
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:31,049
That's the only way to prevent
any potential damages.

749
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,885
You want to remain healthy
when you meet your family, right?

750
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,094
In order to do so,

751
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:39,474
you must also do
what you don't want to do.

752
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,603
There is something you can do,
so why are you avoiding it?

753
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:46,856
What…

754
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:51,694
What can I do?

755
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,364
Arrest the infected
who are pretending to be humans.

756
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,200
And restore order here.

757
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,648
That jerk must be throwing up.

758
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,942
Shouldn't we throw up too?

759
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,237
It did taste a bit bitter.

760
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,157
I never threw up before. How do I do it?

761
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,701
Just wait a bit.

762
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:53,298
Min-ji became like that
because she took drugs, right?

763
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:00,763
These are the drugs the fitness trainer
was secretly selling.

764
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,059
Did you spike the drinks with this?

765
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,812
You were the one
who put the drinks in the gym, right?

766
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,189
To get everyone in the building infected.

767
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,067
Because if all of the residents
either die or get the disease,

768
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,445
you can be cleared of your murder charge.

769
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:18,031
How could you come up
with such a crazy idea?

770
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,365
No.

771
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,909
I just need you two dead.

772
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,786
The rest are just bonuses.

773
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,790
More people should be infected
for the cure to come out soon.

774
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,250
This is just ridiculous.

775
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,003
You're confessing your crimes now, right?

776
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:36,591
So just go home and never come out.

777
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,676
If you get accused
of being infected and die,

778
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,095
it'll just be your loss!

779
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:47,143
Just stay home and live quietly
until the cure is developed, okay?

780
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,188
You killed Park Min-ji too, right?

781
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,481
No.

782
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,358
I didn't kill anyone.

783
01:00:54,567 --> 01:01:00,281
You two should just shut up and stay home
if you don't want to kill someone.

784
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:05,536
If not, just go outside and ask
that Lieutenant Colonel guy for help.

785
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,829
But the thing is…

786
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,043
This…

787
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,130
What are you doing?

788
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:19,550
What's wrong with you?

789
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,806
Why did you take that? Spit it out!

790
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,558
It's bitter.

791
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:31,312
It's an indigestion reliever
I took when I played baseball.

792
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,608
What is this? Is this food?

793
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,986
Indigestion meds. I had a stomachache
when I was nervous about my game.

794
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:43,282
I was worried about what you'd do,
so I replaced them.

795
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,901
Damn it!

796
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,783
And you've been caught
on the dashcam taking the drugs out.

797
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:26,909
Mr. Oh,

798
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,912
you can't get away with it this time.

799
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,249
So what?

800
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,543
What do you mean, "so what"?

801
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,087
A killer should be in quarantine too.

802
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:50,433
Sae-bom.

803
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,978
I'm really sorry, but…

804
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:56,981
I can't get the disease.

805
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,400
Mr. Kim.

806
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,446
Oh Joo-hyung committed murder.

807
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,492
That has nothing to do with us.

808
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,952
What matters now
is if you're infected or not.

809
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,497
You've been in contact
with the infected all this time.

810
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,791
And Ms. Yoon, you got scratched by one.

811
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,877
I think you two should be in quarantine.

812
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,395
We're getting a rare shot,
so we'll get better soon.

813
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,647
We should get well soon.

814
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,399
We're getting the shots already?

815
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,526
This is nice.

816
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:42,610
Hey.

817
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,153
It'll be done in no time.

818
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,995
There were a lot more infected
than I thought.

819
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:56,833
Did all of you take Next?

820
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:00,378
This shot greatly improved my condition.

821
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:01,796
Well done.

822
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,714
You should give it to your wife too.

823
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,007
I should.

824
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:08,469
I heard that Material 13
is hard to produce.

825
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,387
Yes.

826
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,180
We can't make a lot of it.

827
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:15,851
We should maintain
Martial Law for a while.

828
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,938
We must maintain the lockdown
to reduce the number of the infected,

829
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,314
and then release the cure.

830
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:25,528
It would be troublesome to let those
who may have killed someone live.

831
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:26,946
You're right.

832
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,366
Whether the issue gets solved or not,

833
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:33,035
it's better to get rid of those
who may cause problems.

834
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:36,747
People like you.

835
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,209
What are you talking about?

836
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,503
You took the cure
that just began clinical trials

837
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:44,714
by using your money and power.

838
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,675
You should be responsible
for your wrongdoings.

839
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,347
What are you going to do about it?

840
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:38,059
Thanks to all of you,
I can get more help in collecting data.

841
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,201
Have a good time.

842
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:29,360
WONJUNG DORMITORY

843
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,989
Lieutenant Colonel,
there's a problem at the CEO's ward.

844
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:36,909
A mass infection among
the politicians in high positions…

845
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:40,204
They stole Candidate Material 13
and got injected with it.

846
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,709
But that failed
at the second clinical stage.

847
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,628
We were discarding all of it…

848
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,005
I guess they didn't know.

849
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:54,510
They're in high positions,
so tell them to capture them alive.

850
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,096
We have to use them
as clinical test subjects.

851
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,000
Honey.

852
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,298
I'm thirsty.

853
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:34,550
Young-in.

854
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,555
We're almost there now.

855
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,384
I'm running out of patience.

856
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:20,679
Are you thirsty too?

857
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:24,350
They hide their thirst well,
and we can't tell just by looking.

858
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:28,646
Be careful.
You must never trust those people.

859
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,524
Should we look for the infected?

860
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:35,528
You just need to say the woman
on the fifth floor seems infected.

861
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:38,906
When I'm in danger,
I'll take that drug too.

862
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:41,325
I'm sure there will be casualties.

863
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:42,660
I only have one choice.

864
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:44,578
You killed him.

865
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:53,420
