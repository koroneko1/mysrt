00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,445
The sports. The church boy haircut.

159
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,072
He's your perfect straight boy fantasy.

160
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,740
‐ [laughs] Oh, trust me.

161
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,535
Victor is much more than just
a handsome jock.

162
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,328
STEVIE:
He's a handsome ex‐jock.

163
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,746
‐ Yeah. Thank God.

164
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,040
Now I don't have to sit
with the basketball girlfriends

165
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,668
and do the whole
"Go Grizzlies" dance.

166
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,378
[all laughing]

167
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,921
CORYN:
Kill me dead.

168
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,173
[band laughing]

169
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,974
‐ Oh, wow.

170
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,101
Felix, it looks so much better in here.

171
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,980
‐ Mmm‐hmm. First time in years
my mom's actually thrown stuff away.

172
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,066
I do kind of miss the leaning tower
of pizza boxes, though.

173
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,527
DAWN: Felix? Is that you?
‐ Uh‐huh.

174
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,696
DAWN:
I just made schnitzel!

175
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,823
‐ Mmm.
‐ I‐‐ Oh!

176
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,575
Oh, I didn't know we had company.

177
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,494
I... I'm so sorry about the clutter.

178
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,080
You caught us
in the middle of our spring cleaning.

179
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,373
‐ That's our story
and we're sticking to it.

180
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,875
Mom, this is Lake.

181
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,627
‐ Oh, gosh. You're Lake!

182
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,588
You're the Lake!

183
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,882
LAKE: Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
‐ Oh, God! [laughing]

184
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:48,969
Oh! Oh, and you're so gorgeous!

185
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,554
Oh!
‐ Okay, Mom, uh,
don't break my girlfriend.

186
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,681
[laughs]
‐ Okay. Okay. I know. I'm sorry.

187
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,684
I'm sorry. I just, I know how much
you mean to my son.

188
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,436
Would you like to stay?

189
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,063
Because I just made some schnitzel.

190
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,232
‐ Homemade German? I am so in.

191
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,692
DAWN:
Oh, great. That's great.

192
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,986
Honey, will you come to the kitchen
and help me,

193
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,447
so I can gush about your girlfriend
in private?

194
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,032
[laughs]

195
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,826
‐ That went great. Right?

196
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,745
Yeah, I mean, I, I, I, I thought it would,
but I wasn't really sure,

197
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,080
but that actually went really good. I‐‐
‐Yes, it, it did. It did.

198
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,541
It went great. Your mom is awesome.

199
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,210
‐ Okay.

00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,221
‐ Thank you, guys. We're gonna take five,
and we'll be right back.

216
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,226
[clapping]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Whoo! Yeah!

217
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,354
‐ So, what did you guys think?

218
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,939
‐ Oh, I loved that last one.

219
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,483
‐ It was really, really good.
[laughs]

220
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,152
‐ Victor?

221
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,198
‐ Uh, it‐it was cool.

222
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,704
‐ Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

223
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,038
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

224
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,043
‐ Okay. What's up with you?

225
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,712
‐ Nothing. It's just...

226
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,964
a little weird to hear you
and your friends talk about me

227
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,008
like I'm some sort of dumb jock.

228
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,135
‐ They were just joking around.

229
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,470
‐ I'm sorry. I'm just...

230
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,806
messed up right now.
And it's not your fault.

231
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,850
It's just...

232
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,060
I'm, I'm gonna head home.

233
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,354
‐ Okay.

234
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,150
‐ You guys really do sound great, though.

235
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,491
Uh, hey, I have a lot of homework,

236
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,536
so I'm gonna get going.
But, uh, I'll see you tomorrow?

237
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,705
‐ Yeah. Sure.
‐ Okay. All right. Bye, guys.

238
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:22,748
‐ Yep.
MIA: Bye.

239
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,336
‐ Actually, I think I'm gonna
head out, too.

240
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:30,255
I gotta get up at the ass crack of dawn
for practice tomorrow.

241
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,882
You mind hanging with Mia?

242
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,467
LUCY: Yeah, of course.
‐ Oh, okay.

243
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,801
‐ Cool. Well, thank you.

244
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,934
‐ Hey, Shelby.
SHELBY: Oh.

245
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,394
You have a little extra pep
in your step today.

246
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:48,524
‐ Just feeling good about
where I'm at in my life. You know?

247
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,359
ISABEL:
Armando and I were intimate.

248
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:56,365
We're just separated. We're still married,
so it's not a sin. [laughs]

249
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,743
Although I guess he would be
the judge of that. [laughs]

250
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,246
[clears throat]
We're having dinner

251
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,748
to talk about getting back together.

252
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,333
We have our problems, but, I, I,

253
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,710
I really want things to work out.

254
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,629
‐ What kind of problems?

255
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:15,759
He... He doesn't really know
how to talk about his emotions.

256
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,636
‐ Yeah, it's like since
I started coming here,

257
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,264
I feel way more in touch with my feelings.

258
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,474
You know? And‐‐ thanks.

259
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,353
And it just feels so good to not have
everything bottled up inside.

260
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,146
I feel like I'm growing as a person,

261
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,942
which feels dumb to say,
since I'm in my forties.

262
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,027
‐ Oh, no. It's not dumb.

263
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,905
Having a kid come out,
it changes you.

264
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,534
I mean, last month,
I went to drag queen bingo.

265
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,787
‐ How was that?
‐ It's... fun.

266
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,623
I barely recognize
the woman I used to be.

267
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,877
All because my kid was brave enough
to say "I'm gay."

268
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:53,463
FATHER LAWRENCE:
He is? When did he share this with you?

269
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,674
‐ A couple months back.

270
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:59,052
Armando has been surprisingly
accepting of all of this,

271
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,763
considering his machismo.

272
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,849
But I am struggling.

273
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,227
And I, I know...

274
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:11,064
I know that Victor didn't choose
to be this way...

275
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,192
‐ You're a good mother.

276
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,776
That's very clear.

277
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,529
But I think you're, you're right

278
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:18,906
to express your disapproval,

279
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,949
if you want Victor to know God's love.

280
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,328
‐ Oh.

281
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,455
‐ You sound disappointed.

282
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,584
‐ That's what I was always taught.

283
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:34,171
I just thought maybe the church
was a little more flexible nowadays.

284
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:38,133
‐ Do you think God is in the business
of providing loopholes? [chuckles]

285
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,010
ARMANDO:
I just thank God for giving me the courage

286
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,137
to come here, and...

287
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,722
to love my son for who he is.

288
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,308
‐ Oh... [laughs softly]

289
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,853
Meeting's starting.
‐ Right.

290
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,277
‐ [grunts] Oof.

291
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,159
‐ I thought you were done with basketball.

292
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,245
‐ Andrew, what are you doing?
You following me now?

293
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,163
‐ Come on. Let's go.

294
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:14,628
All right.

295
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,969
You live for this.

296
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,307
‐ [sighs] Listen.

297
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,851
How many times do I have to tell you

298
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,936
I'm not gonna be part of a team
that doesn't want me?

299
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:34,106
‐ And how many times do I have to
tell you they will come around?

300
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,691
‐ Right.

301
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,694
Because I am "the least gay
gay person alive."

302
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,948
‐ I'm guessing that was
a stupid thing to say.
‐ No.

303
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,157
No, it was perfect.

304
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,243
Please, tell me what's the exact level
of gay I should be.

305
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,663
What is a perfect level of gay
that will keep everyone happy?

306
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,749
Because apparently,
I'm too gay for the locker room,

307
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,710
but I'm not gay enough
for Benji and his friends.

308
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,503
So, where do I belong?

309
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,509
‐ You belong on a basketball court.

310
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,721
‐ [sighs] Let's say I do come back.

311
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:11,185
What happens if one day I do
want to be more "gay gay?"

312
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,729

I didn't think you were gonna come.

your scene, but um‐‐

00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,096
I'm really sorry about all those
stupid jokes.

474

If basketball makes you happy, well...

way harder than it looks.

Lakey. Hi! Did you watch?

00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,720
I crushed it on Good Morning Atlanta.

498
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,639
I interviewed Sarah Jessica Parker
over Skype,

499
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,307
and she said I had pretty eyes.

500
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,478
Hey, what's wrong?
‐ Nothing.

Congratulations on the show.

You really are the second best

‐ Hey, uh, we need to talk.

ISABEL:
I am so sorry I'm late.

511
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,930
I changed four times
before coming here.

512
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,434
What do you wear to a sort of date
with your husband

513
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,644
who you're sort of separated from,

514
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,855
but definitely had full‐on sex with?

ARMANDO:
[laughs] Well, uh...

516
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,735
I always liked you in green.
‐ Oh. Well, thank you.

517
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,905
I'm happy we're doing this.

518
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,573
I miss you.

‐ I miss you, too.

00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,869
Okay, Mando, I'm just gonna jump right in.

521
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,329
‐ Okay.

522
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:59,875
‐ The affair with Roger...

523
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:04,880
It broke something,
and that is my fault.

524
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,590
And I am so sorry that I,

525
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,134
I pressured you so hard to get over it.

526
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:12,471
‐ No. But our problems
started before that.

527
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:16,183
Yeah, I‐I think the real reason
we separated was because

528
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:18,435
we were stuck in a pattern,

529
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:21,480
and the only way to get un‐stuck
is if we both change.

530
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:27,986
That's why I keep asking you
to come to PFLAG with me.

531
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,321
And every time you say no,

532
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:33,075
it just feels like
you don't want to change.
‐ I do want to.

533
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,870
I went to see Father Lawrence yesterday,

534
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,705
to talk about everything.

535
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,290
‐ How'd it go?

536
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,878
‐ He said if... Victor chooses this path,

537
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,797
that he will never know God's love.

538
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,802
And I'm thinking, how can that be?

539
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:56,807
He is such a good son.
He is such a good person...

540
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:58,642
Why is this happening to him?

541
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,353
‐ Is‐Isa, it's not happening to him, okay?

542
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,063
It's just who he is.

543
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:07,442
You know, this whole thing with Victor,
it's...

544
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,778
It's made me really look at myself,

545
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,114
and really try and change.

546
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:20,789
But if you're not going to change with me,

547
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,462
I don't know what the future holds.

548
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:39,433
‐ Andrew. What are you doing here?

549
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,187
‐ Lucy broke up with me.

550
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,063
She spent one night talking to you,

551
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,274
and she broke up with me.
‐ [sighs] Oh, my God.

552
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,942
I'm so sorry.

553
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:53,530
‐Lucy, she asked me if anything
had ever happened between us,

554
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,782
and I felt like I had to be honest.

555
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:59,203
But I really never meant to‐‐
‐ Mia...

556
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:00,704
‐ Yes?

557
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:03,040
‐ It's okay.

558
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,752
‐ It is?
‐ Yeah.

559
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:10,672
‐ Why is your hair pink?

560
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,885
‐ I was trying to make things
right with Victor.

561
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:18,388
Which is actually your fault, too.

562
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:21,099
‐ Why is that my fault?

563
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,563
‐ For as long as I can remember,

564
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:29,107
anytime I wanted to take the easy way out,

565
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:32,986
there was always this annoying voice
in the back of my head,

566
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:36,114
pushing me to do better.
To be better.

567
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:38,992
You know whose voice that is?

568
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,749
Even when you're not around me,
I always hear you.

569
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:49,628
So, when Lucy ended it,

570
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,338
I figured, hey.

571
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,382
I've taken a million shots with you,

572
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:56,093
but I am about to take a million and one.
