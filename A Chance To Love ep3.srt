1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,420
Dude

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,800
I have no idea what's going on between them

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:04,960
But

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,720
Pete won't come and check on him?

5
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,120
They used to love each other so much

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,580
What did you just say?

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,200
I said

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,460
You're just

9
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,420
An unloved child

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,220
Why didn’t you go to the party with mom?

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,920
Did she report that to her favorite son?

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,320
It’s you

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,020
You’re the son that she loves most

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,100
Don’t make me laugh

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,320
It’s because you’re not free today

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,380
That’s why she told me to come

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,120
You’re overthinking

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,160
How can she love a stepson like me

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,180
more than her real son?

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,040
If you want to keep acting

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,340
Do it somewhere else

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,960
I’m sick of it

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,760
You’re always like this

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,660
You should pay more attention to your family

25
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,680
Just do whatever you want

26
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,360
Someday

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,480
I will tear off your mask

28
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,340
That day won’t come

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,880
That day won’t come

30
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,300
What did you just say?

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,980
I said

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,120
You are

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,120
An unloved child

34
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,290
He’s not disgusting…

35
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,350
But he called me an unloved child, didn’t he?

Can

60
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,450
What’s wrong?

61
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,890
Can!

62
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,030
No! I didn’t kiss!

63
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,030
What’s wrong?

64
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,390
No

65
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,730
Nothing’s wrong

66
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,330
That’s right

67
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,510
I’m eating breakfast

68
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,490
Are you sure?

69
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,410
Sure

70
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,950
I’m just eating my breakfast

71
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,310
Sure?

72
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,990
Sure

73
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,430
Alright everyone

74
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,410
You guys probably understand about this

75
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,050
About today...

76
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,690
What I wrote on the board...

77
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,190
Please wake your friend up

78
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,210
If he’s going to sleep then don’t disturb other people

79
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,570
Can

80
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,550
Can!

81
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,790
No! I didn’t kiss!

82
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,930
It seems like you really miss your girlfriend

83
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,610
Why don’t you just drop the class and stay with her?

84
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,830
I…I don’t have any girlfriend

85
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,630
Also, I don’t want to drop the class

86
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,110
Let’s continue with the class

87
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,270
Are you serious?

88
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,750
Can was daydreaming and yelling in the class?

89
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,290
You’re amazing

90
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,450
I’m serious

91
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,310
He suddenly yelled in class

92
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,390
Even though he likes to yell and annoy others

93
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,730
But today he’s even worse

94
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,830
I think he’s crazy

95
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,170
I’m not

96
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,250
I just…

97
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,270
I didn’t sleep that much last night

98
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,850
What did you do then?

99
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:33,990
Bro

100
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,810
I have something to think about

101
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,770
Someone like you?

102
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,510
Apart from eating

103
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,090
And talking too much

104
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,550
I don't think you've used your brain much

105
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,210
So, what were you thinking about?

106
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,070
Maybe I can help you

107
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,230
That’s right

108
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,910
Tell us

109
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,130
Maybe we can help

110
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,390
Why would I tell you guys?

111
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,210
I won’t say a word!

112
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,910
Wait, Can!

113
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,610
Damn it

114
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,470
I still don’t know who he kissed and turned him into this

115
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,950
Exactly

116
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,730
Who would want to kiss someone like Can?

117
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,990
Come on

118
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,410
Look at Techno

119
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,450
Someone already has eye on him

120
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,290
Someone might like Can too

121
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,630
Even though he’s talkative

122
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:24,990
But…

123
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,090
You cannot even think about other good things about him

124
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,750
Wait, Bro. What were you saying again?

125
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,130
Who has eye on Techno?

126
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,090
Why would I tell you?

127
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,610
You again?

128
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,590
I still didn’t clear things up for what you did

129
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,690
Do you know that my life is such a mess now?

130
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,030
My sister scolded at me

131
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,490
Teacher also told me to drop the class

132
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,170
My friends were laughing at me

133
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,590
Also…

134
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:22,670
You kissed me

135
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,650
Where’s the guy named Ae?

136
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,250
You’re Ae’s friend?

137
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,150
No

138
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:33,930
Huh?

139
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,090
There's no reason for me to be friend with a guy from Thai program

140
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,410
Hey!

141
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,310
Are you here to mess with my friend?

142
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,930
If you’re here to mess with him, I’ll punch you in the face first

143
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,550
Whatever

144
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,590
You’re all pathetic

145
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,790
I don’t like it when other people insult my friend

146
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,330
You can call me stupid, annoying, dirty

147
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,190
Just do it

148
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,790
But you have no rights to insult my friend

149
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,330
What’s your problem?

150
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,530
Why are you so hostile towards everyone?

151
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,870
Who made you become like this?

152
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,890
Did the world hurt you so badly that’s why you become like this?

153
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,270
Maybe I’m like what you said

154
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,490
I said many things

155
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,590
Which one are you referring to?

156
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,430
An unloved child

157
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:17,930
Are you crazy?

158
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,350
Do you want to die?

159
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,830
Are you too stupid to know that you’re not supposed to cut off like that?

160
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,850
I’m sorry

161
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,290
What?

162
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,330
Please

163
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,390
I’m sorry

164
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,070
I know that I just knew you

165
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,810
I shouldn’t call you an unloved child

166
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,930
I’m sorry

167
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,530
Please

168
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,150
Forgive me

169
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,690
But you started it first

170
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,710
You’re foul-mouthed

171
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,830
But I didn’t mean to blame it on you

172
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,570
It’s my fault

173
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,830
Please don’t be mad at me

174
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,970
Or else I won't be able to sleep tonight. I will have a nightmare for sure

175
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,130
I don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings

176
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,690
Please

177
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,370
Let’s make peace

178
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,270
What did you do?

179
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,710

202
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,350
Why did you just come back?

203
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,030
I waited for you for such a long time

204
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,510
I miss you

205
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,970
I miss you too

206
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,590
Are you here alone?

207
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,010
Yes

208
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,950
Dad is not here. He’s still at work

209
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,630
Mom went out to see grandmother

210
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,090
I’m so lonely. I’m home alone

211
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,710
Phupha

212
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,150
You’re here

213
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,130
Don’t rush out just like that

214
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,650
I’m already old

215
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,570
I cannot keep up with you

216
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,110
Then don’t follow me

217
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,030
I didn’t ask you to do that

218
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,350
What does she mean by rushing out?

219
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,910
When you abruptly ran out of the room like that

220
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,330
No one’s home?

221
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,630
No one comes back yet

222
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,370
Vadee said she will go to another house first

223
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,810
She left Phupha with me

224
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,990
Everyone left me alone again

225
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,590
Don’t say that, Phupha

226
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,910
Come with me

227
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,250
I don’t want to

228
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,510
I want to stay with uncle Tin

229
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,270
Okay

230
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,310
I will take care of him

231
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,230
Okay

232
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,050
Thank you so much

233
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,330
Let’s go and play over there

234
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,370
Uncle Tin, it wasn't fun at all to hang out with mom

235
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,930
I wanted to come back home

236
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,290
I missed dad

237
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,150
I missed you too, uncle Tin

238
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,570
It’s so cold there

239
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,910
Why?

240
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,870
You didn’t have any friends there?

241
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,490
No

242
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,310
I don’t want any friends

243
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,370
I just want dad to hang out with me

244
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,150
Do you feel lonely?

245
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,630
How about you?

246
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,690
Should I be lonely?

247
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,470
Of course

248
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,970
If I'm not here with you

249
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,910
You must think of me, okay?

250
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,110
My hair is messy now

251
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,810
Really?

252
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,610
When will dad come back home?

253
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,130
Why?

254
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,450
Because I miss him

255
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,910
You love him a lot, don’t you?

256
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,210
I love him so much

257
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,090
I love him this much

258
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,030
I love dad so much

259
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,990
I like my name too

260
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,310
Because Phupha means

261
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,090
The love that I have for someone

262
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,500
That love is strong and eternal

263
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,860
Dad!

264
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,620
I miss you so much

265
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,040
I miss you too

266
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,950
Thank you, Tin

267
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,450
For what?

268
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,230
Taking care of my love

269
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,460
Have you eaten yet?

270
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,500
Yes

271
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,580
Why did I suddenly think of him?

272
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,970
I know now who he’s like

273
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,010
He’s like a 5 years old kid

274
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,430
Hello

275
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,890
I have something for you to search for me

276
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:22,970
Ae!

277
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,310
Stop it

278
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,090
Are you going to keep drinking until you die?

279
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,650
I will drink until I die. Isn’t that great plan?

280
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,350
Pete won’t be happy to see you like this

281
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,350
He’s not here with me

282
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,250
He’s not here. Do you hear me?

283
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,870
He’s not here with me

284
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,010
I told you to stop

285
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,830
Leave me alone

286
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,070
Damn it

287
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,830
What should I do?

288
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,790
Mai

289
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,550
Right here

290
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,650
What’s up

291
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,830
Can you help me?

292
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,210
I can’t stop him

293
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:10,750
Hey!

294
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,010
What’s wrong with you, shorty?

295
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,310
I don’t know how long he’s been drinking like this

296
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,930
Normally he never drank

297
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,490
He always took care of his health

298
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,870
Look at him now

299
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,910
All you do is lecturing him

300
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,870
Do you think he will listen?

301
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,090
He’s drunk

302
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,790
What do you expect me to do?

303
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,690
What the hell are you doing, asshole?

304
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,730
Come with me, shorty

305
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,390
What are you doing?

306
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,050
Come with me

307
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,190
Let me go

308
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,980
Mai!

309
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,270
Come here

310
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,950
Get the ball for me, Pond

311
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,750
Just get it

312
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,270
Fine

313
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,550
Keep your eyes on him

314
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,890
Don’t fight with him

315
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,260
He's out of his mind now

316
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,720
I know

317
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,970
Look at my friend

318
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,890
He’s no better than a dog

319
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,430
Just leave me alone, asshole

320
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,350
I don’t want to bother you

321
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,250
If you’re not my friend

322
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,750
Give it to me

323
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,290
What are you going to do?

324
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,230
Wait

325
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,050
Mai, don’t

326
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:35,450
Mai!

327
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,650
You like to play football, don’t you?

328
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,680
Get up!

329
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,860
Why don’t you come back and play the sport that you love?

330
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,840
How long are you going to let yourself fall apart?

331
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,580
My friend, Ae, won't be weak like this

332
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,410
You’re not a loser before

333
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,810
Do you think your boyfriend will be happy to see you being pathetic like this?

334

Tell me

377
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,340
Shit! What happened?

378
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,760
Shorty!

379
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,820
How dare you kick me off the bed?

380
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,020
Why not?

381
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,240
How come you’re sleeping on my bed?

382
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,640
Last night

383
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,700
You two wouldn’t stop hugging each other

384
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,060
That’s right

385
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,600
Last night, you hugged me

386
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,220
And something more

387
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,600
Shit! We’re doomed!

388
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,480
How come you’re here?

389
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,360
That dude

390
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,060
Your wife called me to come

391
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,820
He’s not my wife

392
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,080
Where’s your uniform?

393
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,720
Mai

394
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,560
I asked you to help him

395
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,680
Not to add insult to injury

396
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,520
If Pond didn’t threaten me that he will ask Dear to come instead

397
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,420
I won't come here at all

398
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,900
I didn’t ask for your help

399
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,320
Shorty

400
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,360
You should talk to me nicely

401
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,080
I told you already

402
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,180
I didn’t ask for help

403
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,780
You two, calm down

404
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,600
We’re friends

405
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,220
Ae

406
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,380
What did you tell us what friends are for?

407
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,960
You like to help other people, right?

408
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,380
Then why don’t you care about us?

409
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,020
We are very worried about you

410
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,740
Look at Pond

411
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,660
He’s so freaking worried about you

412
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,100
Have you thought about our friends?

413
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,360
We all know that you’re suffering

414
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,080
Do you think about them?

415
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,720
Do you know how they feel?

416
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,360
Huh?

417
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,020
We are very worried

418
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,880
Shorty

419
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,060
I’m not telling you to stop feeling sad

420
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,580
But please rely on us to help you

421
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,920
Understand?

422
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,780
Do you know what makes me angry the most?

423
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,680
You didn’t ask me to drink with you!

424
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,460
Damn it

425
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,440
What a waste

426
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,340
Damn it. You didn't even ask me to join you

427
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,240
How can you do that to me?

428
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,840
You’re always like this, asshole

429
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,180
You’re going to heal your heart

430
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,000
But you won't let me accompany you?

431
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,160
Damn you

432
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,880
I can’t believe it that you would kick the ball at Ae like that

433
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,720
Because he loves football so much

434
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,840
So, I need to use it to wake him up

435
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,080
Do you think…

436
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,500
he can think clearly now?

437
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,000
I don’t know

438
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,480
Damn you

439
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,700
I asked you for help

440
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,200
I don’t know

441
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,680
My job is to get him out of the bar

442
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,220
He’s wasting too much alcohol

443
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,940
He doesn’t know the pleasure of drinking

444
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,200
Obviously

445
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,780
Who would be such a drunker like you?

446
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,960
Normally it’s Ae who takes you out of the bar

447
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,600
So, you wanted to take a revenge on him, right?

448
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,240
Do you think I don’t know that?

449
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,100
Don't you know who I am?

450
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,860
I'm, Pond, Mr. know it all

451
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,560
You miss it. Come and get me

452
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,500
Come and get me if you dare

453
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,440
Can

454
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,280
Can

455
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,560
What?

456
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,680
Don’t bother me now

457
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,620
I don’t want to lose

458
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,440
Can you come with me?

459
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,460
I don’t want to go. I’m lazy

460
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,180
I’m going shopping. Can you come with me to carry all the stuff?

461
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,300
I don’t want to. I won’t go

462
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,220
It’s my holiday

463
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,980
I’m too lazy

464
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,260
Are you coming or not?

465
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,980
No, I'm not

466
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,800
Fine

467
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,100
I will tell mom

468
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,560
Where you hide the porn magazine

469
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,900
On the bookshelf, second row

470
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,600
Inside your textbook

471
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,380
Mommy

472
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,200
Okay, my lovely sis

473
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,740
Calm down

474
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,140
Tell me where you want to go

475
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,540
I’ll take you there

476
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,900
Come on

477
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,140
Lemon

478
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,620
Do you know what you’re going to buy yet?

479
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,500
What’s the matter?

480
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,460
I cannot accept this

481
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,940
What are you talking about?

482
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,180
What can you not accept?

483
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,080
Pimple is right in front of your face. Can’t you see it yourself?

484
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,920
What are you doing?

485
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,460
Cover up your pimple so you will look more human-like

486
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,580
I don’t want to

487
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,960
I know that I’m stupid but at least I know that you shouldn’t apply makeup when you have pimple

488
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,060
You’re seriously stupid

489
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:16,020
This one can both reduce and cover pimples

490
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,400
Like this

491
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,140
Apply just a little bit

492
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,900
That’s it

493
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,860
It smoothly covers it

494
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,140
I told you

495
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,100
Well…

496
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,400
Can I have it?

497
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,120
I’ll take it as my reward for carrying stuff for you today

498
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,100
I’m off

499
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,740
It’s mine!

500
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,340
I have to use it to cover my pimple too!

501
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,760
Can!

502
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,960
I want this one

503
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,100
Let's go

504
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,740
Let's pay

505
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,540
Let’s go

506
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,240
Give me your hand

507
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,440
This one seems fun

508
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,840
This one too

509
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,120
This one!

510
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,660
Can I play?

511
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,220
Please

512
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,080
Can I play, please?

513
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,560
Give me the coin

514
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
This one looks fun

515
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,400
No! Let’s go

516
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,980
Get all the bags and let’s go

517
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,700
Quickly!

518
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,360
You are too slow

519
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,580
I want to go home now

520
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,800
I’m tired

521
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,900
I’m hungry

522
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Lemon

523
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,420
Why did you buy so many things?

524
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,600
And you won’t carry anything by yourself

525
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,280
My arms and my back hurt

526
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,140
My arms hurt so much

527
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,340
Every time I see you

528
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,100
Why do you always look so weird?

529
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,880
How come you’re here?

530
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,260
Don’t you have any other question?

531
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,600
You suddenly show up

532
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,740
It’s not a coincidence, right?

533
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
It’s a coincidence

534
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,080
Tell me the truth

535
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,200
Are you here to take revenge because you’re mad at me since last time?

536
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,100
Hey!

537
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,540
Who tell you to sit down?

538
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,420
I want to

539
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,400
Fine

540
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,060
Just do whatever you want

541
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,880
What if it’s not a coincidence?

542
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
What the hell?

543
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,180
You just said it’s a coincidence

544
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,860
What if I tell you that…

545
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,920
I want to see you

546
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,600
What are you going to do?

547
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,900
What’s wrong with you?

548
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,220
I’m just joking

549
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,380
My heart is skipping a beat

550
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,980
I’m here to do an errand

551
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,500
What are you doing here?

552
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,780
It’s my business

553
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,180
Don’t stick your nose into my business

554
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,440
Who are you here with?

555
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,820
I told you

556
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,260
Don’t stick your nose into my business

557
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,180
Have you eaten yet?

558
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,260
Tin

559
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:26,960
I’m hungry

560
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,040
Tin

561
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,340
I told you not to bother me

562
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,360
That’s right

563
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,820
These are my girlfriend’s stuff

564
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,900
Girlfriend?

565
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,220
Why not?

566
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,840
Do you think someone like me don’t have a girlfriend?

567
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,260
You should go back where you came from

568
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,980
Can!

569
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,960
Where were you?

570
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,080
I called you but you didn’t pick up the phone

571
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,140
Opps

572
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,800
Hello

573
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,600
You are Can's friend?

574
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,080
I’m Lemon

575
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,640
I am Can’s sister

576
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,960
Sister?

577
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,500
Not girlfriend?

578
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,640
No!

579
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,240
Of course not!

580
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,720
Just sister

581
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,860
A guy like him cannot find any girlfriend

582
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,810
Give me that

583
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,270
Look up and look into my eyes

584
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,650
Look up!

585
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,630
You can cry only because of me

586
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,930
