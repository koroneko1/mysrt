00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,040
NETFLIX PRESENTS

4
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,560
Priming the detonator now.

5
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
Don't trigger until we are safe.

6
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Hot chocolate?

7
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,120
I'm Naomi.

8
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,320
I work for the police.

9
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,000
What's your name?

10
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,200
You don't need to be afraid.
You're safe here.

11
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,080
Anything else you want?
Cookies, maybe?

12
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,320
Can you tell me what happened on board?

13
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Were you traveling with your parents?

14
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,760
Worldwide, the markets are showing
an 8% surge,

15
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,120
driven mainly by airline stocks.

16
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,560
Analysts predict
a strong course correction

17
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,560
which means the markets might face
some instability for some time.

18
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
In spite of the market's current high,

19
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,960
it's still a risky moment
in terms of investment opportunities.

20
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,640
This volatility is also confirmed

21
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,760
by the fact
that gold is at a new seven-year high.

22
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,360
The situation resembles earlier periods
of an overheated market…

23
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,440
Hello.

24
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,240
Hello.

25
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,080
Where's your mom?

26
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,400
She'll be here soon.
She told me to check our bags.

27
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,760
Wait, I'll help you.

28
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,960
Thank you.

29
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,640
What have you got in there? Rocks?

30
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,720
-Hello, little man.
-I've checked the luggage.

31
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,040
No problems.

32
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,680
You're awesome.

33
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,480
-Elias?
-Yes?

34
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,040
I love you.

35
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
See you in a bit, Mom.

36
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,080
There you are! Sweetheart.

37
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,120
There you are. You did great.

38
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,240
Is this yours?

39
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,160
Yes.

40
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,480
I have a prescription.

41
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Mommy will be right back. You stay here.

42
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,400
-Okay, I promise.
-Good.

43
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,840
Excuse me?

44
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,640
It's daytime in America now.

45
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
Look, we are here.

46
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,400
It's night here.
And New York is over there, to the west.

47
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,880
It's day there now. We're flying this way.

48
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,040
But the earth turns this way.

49
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,640
So night will be five hours longer for us.

50
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,320
We'll land at night,
even though it'll be day here.

51
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,280
Wow.
That was a real scientific presentation.

52
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,080
-Isn't your mother back yet?
-She's taking her medicine.

53
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,800
But there's a doctor in America,
Dr. Brown, who can help her.

54
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,560
He'll kill off her bad blood
and plant new bone marrow.

55
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,000
So she'll start making new, healthy blood.

56
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,120
I'm a scientist, too. A physicist.
I'm going to a convention in America.

57
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,240
-I'm Elias.
-I'm Farid.

58
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,720
-Do you have siblings?
-No, no siblings.

59
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,520
-Do you have a favorite team?
-Dragons.

60
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,160
Cool.

61
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,920
Hey, Mom. This is Farid.

62
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,880
He helped me with the luggage.

63
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,040
-Would you like to sit down?
-No, thanks.

64
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
It's a bright boy you got there.

65
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,440
He sure is.

66
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,880
Come on, honey.

67
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,680
Here, Mom.

68
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,560
Rainer, there's no need to be rude.

69
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,440
Those are our compartments.

70
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,720
Just sit, dear.

71
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,720
-Are you comfortable?
-Yes, I'm fine.

72
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,720
So, would you like some coffee, gentlemen?

73
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,360
-Oh yeah. I'll take--
-Black, two sugars?

74
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,640
-You're the best, Julia.
-And one with lots of milk?

75
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,840
Bastian?

76
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,360
Yes, right.

77
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,640
Robert, the guy in 1A is all yours.

78
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,680
The new guy fits all the clichés.

79
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,720
-Are you jealous?
-Excuse me?

80
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,640
Well, now you're not the only one
after the copilot.

81
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,000
The safety instructions

82
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,920
have been placed in the seat pocket
in front of you.

83
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,160
We are third in line for takeoff

84
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,960
and are expected to be in the air
in a few minutes.

85
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,600
Please fasten your seatbelts
and secure all baggage

86
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,760
under your seat
or in the compartments above.

87
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,160
Ensure that your seats and tray tables
are in the upright position.

88
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,680
So?

89
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,680
No idea.

90
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,920
What are we going to do?

91
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,320
You wait in the car. I'll get help.

92
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,160
Someone's freaking out.

93
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,280
Everything is fine, honey.
Go back to sleep.

94
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,080
Hey, Michael. Do you need help?

95
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,520
No worries. I've got it.

96
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
Answer! Where is he?

97
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,560
It's gonna be all right, sweetheart.

98
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,640
We're turning around.

99
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,000
No.

100
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,680
Everything is fine, sweetie.

101
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,360
They are just avoiding a storm.
Don't worry.

102
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,080
Look ahead.

103
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,080
Elias, cut it out.

104
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,240
Put it back.

105
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,440
-We can hide down here.
-Stop it right now. Put it back!

106
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,640
Peace be upon you.

107
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,720
Elias, I said stop it!

108
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,680
Move!

109
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,480
That was just my son.

110
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,640
-No!
-Get up.

111
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,880
It's all right.

112
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,800
It's all right.

113
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,920
It's all right.

114
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,960
"Rejoice

115
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,800
community of…

116
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,720
Muslims."

117
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,200
"Rejoice, community of Muslims."

118
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,000
"In our blessed martyrdom,
Allah the Almighty has allowed us

119
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,280
to carry out an attack on godless Europe."

120
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,520
I have been forced to read this message.

121
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,960
We have nothing to do with the hijacking.
Please help us. Allah akbar.

122
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,080
Read it how it's written.

123
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,080
Already?

124
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,320
You can't do that.

125
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,480
Go back to your seat!

126
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,040
-I thought you were dead.
-It's fine, honey.

127
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,600
We have to turn the plane around.
It'll be fine.

128
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,880
Go!

129
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,040
Don't look.

130
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,000
Don't look.

131
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:17,960
Fuck.

132
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,080
-What are you doing?
-I study aerospace engineering.

133
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,960
Sit down! They'll kill all of us.

134
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,360
Brother, why New York?

135
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,880
-I'm going to a convention.
-Me too.

136
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,520
Nonsense, they're not terrorists.

137
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,080
Why? Because they don't have beards
and pray towards Mecca?

138
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,040
They want to crash the stock market.

139
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,360
Like the bombing a few years ago,
the soccer club.

140
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,680
I've spent a few hours
in a flight simulator, but I…

141
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,400
It will be all right. I promise.

142
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,360
Did you drink blood?

143
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,080
You have to take your medicine.

144
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,560
Hey, everything okay in there?

145
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,040
That wasn't me.

146
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,560
They've got the autopilot on.

147
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,760
Don't.

148
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,200
Let them jump first.

149
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,600
-Turn the plane around.
-What?

150
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,400
I said turn the plane around!

151
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,880
But we're way closer to Europe!

152
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,640
Shit!

153
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,840
Turn around!

154
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,960
Now!

155
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,080
Fuck!

156
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,600
Open the door. Elias!

157
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,480
Can you hear me?

158
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,480
Listen.

159
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,480
You're right. Don't open the door.
No matter what, you're safe in there.

160
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,360
We'll make it. I promise.

161
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,640
Here. It's all right. Okay?

162
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,640
Your baby has been crying
for two hours. Everything all right?

163
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,600
I'm here.

164
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,040
I was hoping you'd come back.

165
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,760
You killed my son. Do you know that?

166
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,440
He bit me.

167
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,120
He had no control over it.

168
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,240
But you do.

169
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,600
No one does.

170
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,040
The evil is too strong.

171
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,840
We are all cursed.

172
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,800
We bring nothing but suffering
to this world.

173
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,920
No! No, stay here!

174
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,520
Come back in. They'll be back!

175
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,320
-Go back.
-I won't leave you alone.

176
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,080
Come! Hurry up!

177
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,280
Help me!

178
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,320
Wait!

179
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,760
Hide. Get in there.

180
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,960
There's no deity but God.
Muhammad is the messenger of God.

181
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,280
Leave her alone!

182
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,880
I have to kill your mama. She's evil.

183
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,200
You're the evil one!

184
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,920
Don't move!

185
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,760
Can you do that?

186
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,640
Don't move!

187
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,640
Can you shoot someone?

188
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,880
Come on!

189
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,960
We are cursed.

190
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,280
We cannot allow this evil
to keep spreading.

191
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,400
This evil cannot keep spreading!

192
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,800
We have to stop it.

193
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,120
You have the evil within.

194
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,760
And you cannot

195
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,920
control it.

196
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,560
Everything okay?

197
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,760
-I want to see my mom!
-No.

198
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,480
Elias, stay here.

199
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,720
Out of the way!

200
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,240
-Mom!
-Elias, stay here!

201
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,840
Let's get out!

202
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,240
We need help!

203
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,560
Help!

204
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,480
Did he bite you?

205
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,320
Did he bite you?

206
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,120
Ingelore?

207
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,560
Ingelore?

208
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,920
Ingelore, where are you?
I'm looking for my wife.

209
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,080
Give it to me.

210
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,760
Out of the way!

211
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:16,560
Let me through!

212
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,640
Let me through!

213
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,120
-I need to find my wife.
-Where is she?

214
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,560
The monster got her!

215
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,160
She's not a monster!

216
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,640
Hey, not through here.

217
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,480
Hey, kid! What's wrong with your mother?

218
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,760
-She doesn't have leukemia.
-I never said that.

219
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:30,160
-Don't hurt her, please.
-I won't, I promise. What's her name?

220
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,840
-Nadja.
-Okay. You stay here. Watch him!

221
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,280
Sure.

222
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,680
Mama, watch out! They want to kill you!

223
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,400
Mama! Can you hear me?

224
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,320
They want to kill you!

225
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,200
Nadja? Can you hear me?

226
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,680
Elias sent me. We don't want to hurt you!

227
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,880
Ingelore!

228
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:03,800
Ingelore!

229
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,760
Ingelore. What happened to you?

230
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,640
Oh no, this can't be.

231
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,080
No!

232
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,760
Give it to me! Come on!

233
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,440
-Wait! Hold on.
-You killed my wife!

234
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,480
Hey! Stay here! Stop him!

235
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:13,840
Don't do it!

236
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,800
No!

237
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,800
Don't shoot!

238
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,400
We can't let them come up.

239
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,400
You have to help her!

240
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,560
He bit me.

241
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,960
I can't feel my fingers!

242
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,440
Shit.

243
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,000
Stay here.

244
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:19,520
Oh my God. Elias! Get some help, quick!

245
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,360
Quick!

246
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,680
Help me!

247
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,200
We need heavy people
to weigh down the hatch!

248
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:28,960
No!

249
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,640
Don't bite him!

250
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,120
Stop, go away! Don't drink his blood!

251
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,040
Elias, get back. He's dangerous.

252
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,320
He wants to be healed, just like you!

253
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,240
-No! Don't!
-Calm down!

254
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,920
I'm right here.

255
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,560
My hand got caught in the cargo hold door.

256
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,120
Your mom helped me.

257
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,120
Come.

258
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,640
Elias. Come.

259
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,080
Turn the plane around.

260
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,240
-Do it!
-I have to check our route. We're too low.

261
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,040
-Mom.
-What's going on?

262
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:56,120
She wants us to fly to New York.
But we're too low and short on fuel.

263
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:59,800
We have to divert to the nearest airport,
or we'll crash into the sea.

264
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,320
-Turn that plane!
-We can't make it to New York.

265
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,680
Do you understand?

266
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,920
It's dark down there.

267
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,320
Come on, let's go!

268
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,560
They wanted to blow down the door.

269
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,880
Watch out, it's on!

270
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,560
Not anymore.

271
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:56,560
It's gonna be fine. We'll wait until dark
and catch the next plane to New York.

272
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,640
Mom, look how far we've come.

273
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:04,480
Mom! Please, we'll can do it.

274
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,240
Dr. Brown will make sure
we get the Cytarabine.

275
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:30,080
We'll have enough time
to plan the next flight.

276
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,440
Shit.

277
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,760
Fuck!

278
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,800
-What's wrong?
-I don't know. Something's wrong.

279
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,920
-Bastian!
-What's going on?

280
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,080
Get down.

281
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,000
Wait, I'll help you.

282
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,120
Hey, what are you doing?

283
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,760
We can help them!
We can hide them down there!

284
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:10,360
If we open the door,
we'll never get it shut again.

285
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,920
We can't land.

286
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,360
What do you mean?
You want to crash the plane, or what?

287
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:34,520
They'll hide in the cargo bay
until dark and then get out, all of them.

288
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,240
We have to inform officials.

289
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,920
And tell them what?
We have vampires on board?

290
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,600
No, we have to…

291
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,880
We have to land and then jump.

292
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:46,960
Here. If we attach this to the fuel tank,

293
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,160
it'll blow up the whole plane.
How do we get there?

294
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:57,080
-That's the fuel tank.
-Fuck. Shit.

295
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:58,760
What?

296
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,600
The detonator has no timer.
Is there a remote?

297
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:02,760
-Yeah.
-Where is it?

298
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:03,680
Curtiz had it.

299
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,280
-Where is that arsehole?
-In the rear cargo hold.

300
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,080
Okay.

301
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,440
-Does this lead to the back?
-Yes.

302
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,400
Man!

303
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:20,880
Shit! It's way too narrow.

304
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,520
Can we detonate manually?

305
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,640
Yes. But then we'll blow up too.

306
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,120
You land the plane.

307
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,600
And as soon as you're out,

308
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:35,720
I'll blow it up.

309
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,880
No, Mama!

310
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,640
-Yes, Elias.
-We can get you out of here.

311
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:43,320
-You can hide in here.
-Elias, we have no other choice.

312
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,120
-I can fit. I can get the remote.
-Elias, it's over!

313
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,520
Do you hear me?

314
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,200
Forgive me, please.

315
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,480
I can get past with this.

316
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,320
Elias--

317
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,600
Stay here, Elias! Shit!

318
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:06,760
Fuck.

319
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,200
No! That's suicide!

320
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,960
He'll make it. Look.

321
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,600
That's the remote control.

322
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,400
Elias, can you hear me?

323
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,760
The cell phone is the remote control.

324
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,840
Be careful. Don't press the big button.

325
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,480
Elias, come back.
Elias, you hear me? Come back.

326
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:48,960
Elias, run!

327
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:55,040
No!

328
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,480
Shit!

329
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,840
How hard is it to land the plane?

330
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,920
What? Why? We'll make it.

331
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,360
I entered the coordinates.
We fly to the destination automatically.

332
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:27,840
And the landing?

333
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:32,040
You have to stay in the air corridor
and brake. No problem at all.

334
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,680
-Can you handle it?
-What?

335
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,080
With contact to ground control,
anyone can, even with one hand.

336
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,520
You'll have to look after my son.

337
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,080
What do you mean?

338
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,160
Please, just promise me.

339
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,120
I promise.

340
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,600
Hey, what are you doing? No!

341
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,720
Mama! Help me!

342
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,840
Go away! No!

343
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,280
No!

344
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,640
Come on!

345
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,240
Come on!

346
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:15,200
Come on!

347
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:18,960
Come and get me!

348
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,560
No. Elias.

349
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:32,280
Mama!

350
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,360
Talk to me, please.

351
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,600
Shit!

352
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:52,760
Autopilot.

353
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,400
No! Go away!

354
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,680
Stay with me.

355
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,800
Where's Farid?

356
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:37,320
You mean Farid al Adwa?

357
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,480
He's still on the plane.
The police have him under control.

358
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,880
You have to get him out.

359
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,200
No matter what Farid told you,
he's one of the bad guys.

360
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:48,400
No! You have to get Farid out
to save him from the vampires.

361
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:51,080
-The plane is full of them.
-Calm down. What happened?

362
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,080
You have to get Farid out of there
before sunset.

363
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,520
We need your help.

364
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,560
Can you tell me
how many kidnappers there are?

365
01:44:58,640 --> 01:44:59,480
They're all dead!

366
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,720
-Dead? How?
-They are all monsters!

367
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:05,400
You have to get Farid out of there
before the sun goes down!

368
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:09,120
-No! Stop it!
-Calm down.

369
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:11,280
Let me go!

370
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,680
Let go of me!

371
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,360
Let…

372
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:18,800
You have to

373
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,320
save

374
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:21,920
Farid.

375
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:10,720
No. Please! Don't!

376
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:43,000
You have to get Farid out!
Where's my teddy?

377
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:44,840
Where's my teddy?

378
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:45,960
My bear!

379
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,000
Elias! I'm here!

380
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:22,920
-I'm here! Elias!
-Farid!

381
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,400
No!
