1
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:36,458
Some of this story is adapted
from the legend of Ayothaya.

2
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,333
A long time ago...

3
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,916
beyond all imagination...

4
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,458
in the center of the earth

5
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:48,958
was Mount Meru,
which was as tall as the clouds.

6
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,750
At the time, all the land was one.

7
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:03,583
It was divided
into small and big kingdoms.

8
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:12,166
One of them was called Ayothaya.

9
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,291
It was located on a rich and abundant land

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,583
surrounded by converging rivers.

11
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:25,000
It appeared as if an island
had risen up from underneath.

12
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,125
Ayothaya was originally a small city

13
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:32,500
that was established by powerful demigods.

14
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,333
Later,

15
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:44,000
the Kinnara, or male human-birds,
took over

16
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:48,375
and nurtured and developed it
to become a huge kingdom.

17
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,708
But after a series of wars,

18
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:58,166
the Kinnara army was defeated
by the mighty Garuda army.

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,583
The Kinnara became slaves to the Garuda

20
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,208
for thousands of years.

21
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,375
Then, 200 years ago,

22
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,625
a young slave rose up

23
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:20,250
to lead the Kinnara
across the Great Sidantara Ocean

24
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,541
and establish a new kingdom
in the faraway Himmaphan Forest...

25
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:30,458
well known for being home
to remarkable legendary animals

26
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,000
that no one had ever seen.

27
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,416
North of Ayothaya

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,250
stretched the Singkonkiri Mountains.

29
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,333
Beyond the mountains

30
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:51,125
was an inhospitable land
as hot as the fires of hell.

31
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,875
The horrifying land...

32
00:03:56,166 --> 00:04:00,291
was occupied by savage, ruthless monsters

33
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:05,500
called the Rakshasa.

34
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,500
These monsters were vicious, savage,

35
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,375
and skilled in every form of combat.

36
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,000
They attacked and routed
the other kingdoms

37
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:20,708
until they finally crossed
the Singkonkiri Mountains,

38
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:26,375
heading straight 
for the last kingdom standing,

39
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,416
which was... 
Ayothaya, the Garuda's kingdom.

40
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,041
Vayu, Varee, heed my commands.

41
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,625
-Yes, sir.
-Both of you shall

42
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,750
fly ahead to the Singkonkiri Mountains.

43
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,000
If you see anything suspicious,
report back immediately.

44
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,875
Yes, sir.

45
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,166
The rest of you will be on guard duty.
We're spending the night here.

46
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,291
THE SINGKONKIRI MOUNTAINS

47
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,333
It's cold. Are you cold, Vayu?

48
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:59,291
It would be nice to have a campfire
in such cold weather.

49
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,125
Hey, Varee. No!

50
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:05,083
-Do not start a fire.
-I know, I know. I didn't mean it.

51
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm not stupid like you, bro.

52
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,666
By the way,

53
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:14,333
a hundred years ago,
if King Subunpon hadn't abdicated

54
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,958
and become a monk,
this wouldn't have happened...

55
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,041
Sir, I can smell the Rakshasa army.

56
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,791
Vayu, we can't defeat them.

57
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,291
Your big wings make you
the fastest flier in the army.

58
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,333
Go tell the master.

59
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,708
-But what about you?
-No buts.

60
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,833
Hurry, come on. Go!

61
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,500
Bring it on, assholes.

62
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,958
I have a blade for each of you.

63
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,708
Get back. He's mine.

64
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:56,958
Get back.

65
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,125
Get back.

66
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,750
Dumbass!

67
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,250
Sir, the Rakshasa have crossed the border.

68
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,458
I know. Hurry, show me the way.

69
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Pichai. Bawon.

70
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,666
Form a two-pronged attack.

71
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,583
-Left and right.
-Yes, sir!

72
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,666
Varee! Varee!

73
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,416
Where are you, my brother?

74
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,166
Men, retreat! Let's go!

75
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,416
AYOTHAYA'S INNER COURT

76
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:21,000
KING SURIYAINTRA

77
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,666
AYOTHAYA'S KING

78
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,166
It was hot and sweaty, but worth it!

79
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,708
Such beautiful diamonds
for such little effort.

80
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,833
Look at this!

81
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,333
I told you.

82
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,791
King Suriya-indra knows next to nothing.

83
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,625
There are no Kinnari
in Ayothaya these days.

84
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,875
The Minister.

85
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,083
Hand them over.

86
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,166
Get out of here!

87
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,083
You vagrant Garuda!

88
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,666
Finally!

89
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,708
Varee? You're not dead?

90
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,333
Damn you!

91
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,916
Sorry to disappoint.

92
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,625
No! I was worried sick.

93
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,000
Despite your foul mouth,
you're still my dear younger brother.

94
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,166
Isn't that right, bro?

95
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,625
This is to show my love.

96
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,500
Stop! No need to love me that much.

97
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,750
Varee! How did you survive?

98
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,458
What happened?

99
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:24,125
Sir, I gave it my all
but I still couldn't defeat them.

100
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,375
When they breathed fire at me,

101
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,208
I jumped into the water to hide.

102
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,166
To my surprise, they didn't come after me.

103
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,250
They just stood there watching.

104
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,875
So, I escaped through a crevice...

105
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,666
and found my way out to this river.

106
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,041
All right. I'm glad that you're okay.
Get up.

107
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,000
I think

108
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,041
they were just scouts.

109
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,916
If so, the main army of the Rakshasa

110
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,791
will be here soon.

111
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,000
A lot of our soldiers
are injured right now.

112
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,750
We need to stop and rest.

113
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,500
I think we should do two things.

114
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,750
First we must notify Ayothaya
to get ready.

115
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,791
Our second task
is to search for King Subunpon,

116
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,666
who has abdicated
and become a monk in the forest.

117
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,083
We'll ask him to come back
and lead the army

118
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,375
to protect Ayothaya.

119
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,250
Sir, I would like to volunteer
to go to Ayothaya.

120
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,375
Great, Pichai.

121
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:34,333
Once the soldiers have recovered,
I'll return immediately. 

122
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,750
So, Bawon, it is up to you 
to seek out King Subunpon

123
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:43,041
and convince him to return to Ayothaya.

124
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,833
Yes, sir. Right away.

125
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:55,291
FOREST ON AYOTHAYA'S BORDER

126
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,375
Garuda bones?

127
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,916
Greetings, Your Majesty.

128
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:50,500
Is that you, Bawon?

129
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,833
AYOTHAYA'S OUTER WALLS

130
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,125
Stop!

131
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,750
No one is allowed to fly in here.

132
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,791
Please open the gate. I have urgent news.

133
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,791
Who are you?
Don't you know the Garuda's laws?

134
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,750
My name is Pichai.

135
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm the right-hand soldier
of Phya Watchara,

136
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,541
reconnaissance commander.

137
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:20,375
I have urgent news for Ayothaya.
Please hurry and open the gate.

138
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,833
No! The Defense Minister has ordered

139
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,791
not to open the gate at night.

140
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,041
Come back again in the morning.

141
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,916
It would be too late.

142
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:35,583
I have to notify King Suriya-indra
right now. Open the gate!

143
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,041
Or I'll have no choice but attack.

144
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,541
You can try!

145
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,833
Isn't that Phya Watchara?

146
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,541
I am Phya Watchara,

147
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,458
-reconnaissance commander of Ayothaya.
-Move, move.

148
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,583
Open the gate

149
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:33,000
so my army can enter.

150
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,416
Wait!

151
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,500
Commander, what's the hurry?

152
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,916
Why aren't you guarding the border?

153
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You could be severely punished
for abandoning your post.

154
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,458
Don't you realize?

155
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,958
Let me explain, Minister.

156
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,958
I have not abandoned my post.

157
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,708
The Rakshasa army has crossed the border.

158
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,583
Haven't you received news?

159
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:02,125
Nonsense. Nobody came to notify me.

160
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,666
What? Impossible.

161
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,708
I sent Pichai here a while ago.

162
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,416
-Why--
-All right.

163
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,625
I'll notify the King myself.

164
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,333
Phya Watchara,

165
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,083
bring your soldiers in to rest.

166
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,375
You, open the gate!

167
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,500
The enemy is at the doorstep,

168
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:35,083
why are the people of Ayothaya
still not preparing anything?

169
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,916
What happened to you, Pichai?

170
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:02,166
Your Majesty,
it's time to drink your medicine.

171
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:06,208
No. I don't want to. I'm not sick.

172
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,458
You must drink it in order to get well.

173
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,958
No. I said no. Get out!

174
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,791
Very good, Your Majesty.

175
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,625
Now, press your finger here.

176
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,125
Just like that. Beautiful.

177
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,708
Thank you, Your Majesty.

178
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,125
Over my dead body!

179
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,583
Over my dead body!

180
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,750
During this war,

181
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,166
the King has seen fit to appoint

182
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,000
the Defense Minister

183
00:21:55,083 --> 00:22:00,500
as the commander-in-chief
of Ayothaya's army.

184
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,208
He shall have

185
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,625
absolute power to make any command.

186
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,375
Signed and stamped with the Royal Crest,

187
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:13,875
King Suriya-indra, this 110th year

188
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,625
of the King's reign.

189
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,250
Long live the King!

190
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:29,375
Now it is time
to hear my plan to protect Ayothaya.

191
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:35,375
CITY WALL ON THE SOUTH

192
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,041
Damn, I'm bored.

193
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,666
Hey, stop fooling around!

194
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,541
If the master sees you,
you'll be punished severely.

195
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,125
Come on. Relax, Vayu.

196
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:54,833
You know that the Rakshasa
would never come through this way.

197
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,625
Yeah, you're right.

198
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:01,833
That Defense Minister must be
out of his mind

199
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:05,958
to assign formidable soldiers like us
to guard the south fort

200
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,916
and place incompetent soldiers
at the front line.

201
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,500
We will be defeated for sure.

202
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,916
Yeah. Our master disagreed
with the Defense Minister so many times,

203
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,916
but he refused to listen
and even threatened to put us in jail. 

204
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,958
I'm very curious
why King Suriya-indra entrusted

205
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:27,541
that stupid Minister to take charge.

206
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,166
Speaking of His Majesty,
since we've been back,

207
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,833
we have yet to see him.
Something strange is going on.

208
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,208
We've been told not to use cannons,

209
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:45,250
since King Suriya-indra is sick
and doesn't want to be disturbed.

210
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:49,541
We have to ask for permission beforehand.
There'd be no time during an attack.

211
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,875
I agree with you, sir.

212
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,125
Even a naive child can see

213
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,875
that this plan is poorly conceived.

214
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,375
I suspect that the Defense Minister 
is a spy for the Rakshasa.

215
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:04,958
Impossible!

216
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,166
He's a Garuda, after all.

217
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,833
Why would he spy for an enemy
that wants to eradicate his own species?

218
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,000
Greed, sir.

219
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,958
Greed can motivate someone to do anything.

220
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:21,958
If that's true,
Ayothaya could cease to exist.

221
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,791
The Rakshasa are here!

222
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,500
What should I do?
I'm afraid to fire the cannon.

223
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:02,125
Soldier, fire the cannon!

224
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:05,416
-Hurry!
-But the Minister said we're not allowed--

225
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,125
Fuck! Give it to me. I'll take the blame.

226
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,916
Everyone stationed at the cannons,

227
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,875
fire!

228
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,708
Yes, sir!

229
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:24,083
Come on, assholes.

230
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,625
I'm gonna blow your asses away!

231
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:43,666
Phya Watchara, you disobeyed royal orders.

232
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,625
I didn't mean to, sir.

233
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:47,458
It was an emergency,

234
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,666
I didn't have time to ask for permission.

235
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,000
-Or--
-The arrogance!

236
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,458
See what this is?

237
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:56,625
This is the King's sword
of absolute power, given to me

238
00:26:56,708 --> 00:27:00,083
to harshly punish
whoever disobeys my command.

239
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,291
But I didn't--

240
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:05,375
Soldiers, escort him 
to the underground jail.

241
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,666
Sir.

242
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,916
Sir.

243
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:12,625
-As for all of you...
-Yes, sir.

244
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,041
Return to your stations
on the south fort now,

245
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,583
or I'll throw you in jail with him!

246
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,666
-Sir!
-Pichai? What happened?

247
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:35,416
Why are you here?

248
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:39,583
Sir, I was trying to deliver
a message about the war

249
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:41,750
just as you had ordered.

250
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,625
But once I crossed the city walls,

251
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:46,208
I was attacked by a shadowy figure
and knocked out.

252
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,291
When I regained consciousness,
I found myself locked in here.

253
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,291
A shadowy figure?

254
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:53,958
Yes, sir. I couldn't see it clearly.

255
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:56,250
But it was too big and tall
to be a Garuda.

256
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,791
After drinking this special medicine,

257
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:07,041
you'll be resting peacefully.

258
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:22,583
Who do you think you are?
Intruding in the King's sleeping chamber

259
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:25,625
-is punishable by death!
-Minister.

260
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,250
We parted ways only recently,

261
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:31,166
yet you don't recognize me?

262
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,041
King Subunpon! Your Majesty.

263
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:39,291
I failed to recognize you.
Please forgive me.

264
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:43,166
Planning to kill the King
deserves the death penalty.

265
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,458
-Bawon, grab him.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

266
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,500
-Your Majesty. Please let me explain.
-Let's go, Minister.

267
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,666
-Your Majesty.
-This way to jail. Move!

268
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,208
Put him in jail for now.

269
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:55,291
I'll come back for him later.

270
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:59,750
Your Majesty, it's not what it looks like!
Please!

271
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,833
My little brother, are you okay?

272
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,625
I brought you the antidote
that will save you.

273
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,916
Over my dead body.

274
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,541
Over my dead body!

275
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,666
Don't, Suriya-indra! Run!

276
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,166
I'll help you, brother!

277
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,041
No!

278
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,583
Your Majesty.

279
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:35,208
Arise, Watchara and Pichai.

280
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,041
You are both free from punishment.

281
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,291
Let's go protect Ayothaya
from the Rakshasa.

282
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,250
I'll protect it with my life.

283
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,333
-Soldier.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

284
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:50,666
Bring the Defense Minister here
and secure him tightly.

285
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:52,708
-Don't let him out.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

286
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,666
Come on, Watchara.

287
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,333
Let's plan this battle.

288
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,541
-Come!
-No!

289
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,125
Let me go! Let me go this instant!

290
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:08,500
How dare you do this to me?
You dirty little mutts.

291
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,416
When I get out--

292
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,166
Brother.

293
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,083
Suriya-indra.

294
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,500
I would like to fight alongside you

295
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:45,333
and all our soldiers to protect Ayothaya.

296
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:51,291
You're doing the right thing,
Suriya-indra.

297
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:55,958
The King has a duty

298
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:59,041
to protect the land and people
with his life.

299
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:01,041
How touching!

300
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:14,333
Your Majesty,
the Rakshasa army approaches.

301
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,708
The Dark Monster.

302
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:35,416
Capture Ayothaya
and kill every last Garuda!

303
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:28,958
Die! You damned Garuda!

304
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,125
Die!

305
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:11,041
Your Majesty, don't you remember me?

306
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:15,083
You must be the mole.

307
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:20,750
Yes! I am Noir, a Rakshasa,

308
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:24,083
and the top soldier under
our great commander Dark Monster.

309
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:27,375
I've been possessing
this brown-nosed Garuda

310
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:29,541
for quite a while.

311
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:33,125
What fools!
I had you tricked this whole time.

312
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,208
You bastard!

313
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:39,291
Die!

314
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:04,583
What? Two against one?

315
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:07,000
Gotta go. Bye.

316
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,250
Brother!

317
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,125
Finally, we meet again.

318
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:11,458
This time, Ayothaya will be mine.

319
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:22,125
Men, take him!

320
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:52,208
Men, retreat to the south fort. Quick!

321
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,291
Sir, what should we do next?

322
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:08,666
We should reserve our small force
for the time being.

323
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,750
We'll figure out a way to get past them

324
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,750
to find some allies
and recruit more soldiers,

325
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,125
then come back for Ayothaya.

326
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:20,666
But they surround all of the walls.

327
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:27,166
We're going to fly across
the Great Sidantara Ocean.

328
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:31,250
It is immensely vast,
and who knows where the end is?

329
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:35,375
They say even the greatest Garuda
couldn't make the journey.

330
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,250
No Garuda has ever flown across.

331
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,791
We will fly across!

332
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,791
Soldiers,

333
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,958
gather all your strength

334
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:51,583
and prepare 
for the toughest flight of your life.

335
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:34,375
They'd been flying for quite some time,

336
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:38,208
but still couldn't cross
the Great Sidantara Ocean.

337
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,250
Some of the Garuda soldiers

338
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,833
were so exhausted
that they fell into the ocean.

339
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,708
The rest couldn't afford
to help those that fell.

340
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:51,041
Below them were hundreds of Naga...

341
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:56,125
and Anantanagaraj,
the seven-headed King of the Naga,

342
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:58,458
that looked to the fallen Garuda

343
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,208
for their next meal.

344
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:50,625
Finally, after a long, tough flight
of seven days and seven nights,

345
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,583
their perseverance bore fruit,

346
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:56,125
as nine of them survived

347
00:40:56,333 --> 00:41:00,125
the crossing of the vast
Great Sidantara Ocean

348
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,833
and arrived at a mysterious remote land.

349
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:14,708
What the hell is this?

350
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:18,541
What the hell?

351
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:30,250
Hurry, Vayu.

352
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,666
Fly away!

353
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,125
I have no more strength.

354
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,416
I can't even lift my wings.

355
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,291
Just run!

356
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:41,958
-See you.
-Wait for me!

357
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:47,166
-Get on that tree! Hurry!
-Yes, sir.

358
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:58,166
What are they angry about?

359
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,083
Hey, my head!

360
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,916
-My head!
-Come on.

361
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,750
It's better than falling down there
and being crushed.

362
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:08,666
What the hell?

363
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:15,958
Watch out.

364
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,625
Hey, Vayu,

365
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,625
the trees are consoling each other.

366
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:50,375
What? Whoa!

367
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:52,541
They're making very weird sounds.

368
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:55,125
What are they saying, Pirun?

369
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:58,625
They're wondering what we are.

370
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:01,500
Sir, I'll try to converse with them.

371
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,875
Those weird trees told them

372
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:09,875
that the place was Himmaphan Forest.

373
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:15,083
The place where they landed
was home to the Kochasri.

374
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:19,333
To the east dwelled the Norasingha.

375
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:25,375
As for the south, it was the kingdom
of the intellectual Kinnara.

376
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:32,500
So the Kinnara moved out here.

377
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:38,500
Yes, sir. The trees said
the Kinnara's king is Kinnarajan.

378
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:41,875
Kinnarajan?

379
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:45,000
I have an idea.

380
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:48,250
If we can get all these Himmaphan
creatures to be our allies,

381
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,750
then we'll have a strong army.

382
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:54,250
We'll be able to go get Ayothaya
back from the Rakshasa.

383
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,833
What do you guys think?

384
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,958
If I may speak freely, sir,

385
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:03,166
they are wild creatures, free and fierce.

386
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:06,250
I don't think they would agree
to be our allies

387
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,791
unless we force them.

388
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:13,500
But there are only nine of us.
We can't defeat them.

389
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,250
You're right, Pichai.

390
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,166
We have a small force,

391
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:20,916
so we must use our intelligence
to defeat them.

392
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:26,000
However, right now, we're exhausted
from flying across the ocean.

393
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,375
We need to rest and revitalize ourselves.

394
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,000
I agree, sir.

395
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:34,916
My stomach is rumbling
louder than a battle drum.

396
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:37,583
Well, in this wild forest,

397
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,291
where can we get food?

398
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,625
Sir, look!

399
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:02,875
This magic fruit is called Makalee Pon.

400
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:08,791
We'll survive! Hurray!

401
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:13,333
TERRITORY OF HALF-ELEPHANT-HALF-LION

402
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:49,208
Pirun, tell the King of the Kochasri

403
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,500
that we mean no harm.

404
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,166
Attack!

405
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:59,208
King of the Norasingha,
I came here to ask for your help.

406
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:00,416
I came here--

407
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,958
Please, King of the Norasingha...

408
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,708
King of the Norasingha!

409
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:33,583
Let go of my hand.

410
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:35,458
Never!

411
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,250
We'll go down together.

412
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,583
Commander Watchara.

413
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:35,458
King of the Norasingha.

414
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:36,666
What's on your mind?

415
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,750
I'm worried about Ayothaya. 

416
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:49,291
I don't know what's happening there.

417
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:57,875
Then we should move against
the Kinnara as soon as possible.

418
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:36,916
The exit to the labyrinth is closing.

419
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,833
Hurry up, men!

420
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,625
What?

421
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:44,625
What the hell?

422
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:59,250
Hurry! The mountain pass is closing.

423
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:11,833
Get them!

424
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:21,333
Everyone, cut off your wings.

425
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:22,708
Do it!

426
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:26,333
What? Sir, what do you mean?
We're nothing without our wings. 

427
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,750
A wingless Garuda has no honor.

428
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:31,875
We don't have a choice.
It's the only way to survive.

429
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:51,666
Sir!

430
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,541
Move! Come on! Find the gold.

431
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:11,708
You slaves!

432
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:13,625
Chain them securely.

433
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:15,208
When the time comes,

434
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:18,583
I'll send them to be our slaves.

435
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,708
Enough. That's enough for now.

436
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:32,250
Your Majesty, why must you be so stubborn?

437
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:36,958
Tell me the location
of Ayothaya's hidden treasure.

438
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:42,041
Then I'll let you fly freely once more.

439
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:43,666
Otherwise,

440
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:47,791
I'll make you a cripple for life.

441
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,375
My life may be coming to an end,

442
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:56,791
but Ayothaya will stand for a long time.

443
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,416
I will never tell you
the location of the hidden treasure.

444
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:04,875
Go fuck yourself, you monstrous Rakshasa!

445
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:07,625
The arrogance! Hey.

446
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:09,708
Cut his wings off!

447
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,333
Gold? Where is all the gold?

448
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:35,875
It's been over 200 years

449
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,875
since we fled slavery

450
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:41,583
and came here to establish a new kingdom.

451
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:44,416
A free and peaceful kingdom

452
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,000
without killing or corruption.

453
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:50,916
Now, our peace is threatened

454
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,833
by our old enemy, the Garuda.

455
00:53:54,250 --> 00:54:00,166
We have to go to war
to protect our land from the invaders.

456
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,625
Wait, Father!

457
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:05,500
-Kanoknaree.
-I heard that Phya Watchara, their leader,

458
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:09,708
wishes to arrange a summit to discuss
the fight against the Rakshasa.

459
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:13,416
Father, I think we can avoid this war.

460
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,833
A summit?
The Garuda once killed us brutally

461
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:21,083
and took Ayothaya from us.

462
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:24,625
They enslaved us for thousands of years.

463
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:27,250
I will never meet with them--

464
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,000
-But, Father, listen--
-Enough!

465
00:54:29,083 --> 00:54:30,791
Even though you're my daughter,

466
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:37,666
you don't have the right to speak freely
in this meeting. Soldier!

467
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,458
Put her in a cell.

468
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:42,625
Father, please, listen to me.

469
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:45,541
Let go of me. Let go.

470
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:55,916
It's so delicious.

471
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,458
Who lit that bonfire?

472
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:34,041
Kanoknaree, why are you crying?

473
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:37,958
Sakunnee? How did you know I was here?

474
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:41,625
-I know, I know.
-Yeah, that's right.

475
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,791
You're so tiny

476
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:47,166
that you can easily
move through the labyrinth.

477
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,250
Sakunnee, please help me.

478
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,750
Take this

479
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:55,291
and find the Garuda army.

480
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:59,958
Once you find them, give this message
to Phya Watchara, their leader.

481
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:01,916
Can you do that for me, my friend?

482
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:05,083
Of course!

483
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:09,291
How do I know which one is Phya Watchara?

484
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,458
Yes, I forgot to tell you.

485
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:15,958
You will recognize
Phya Watchara of Ayothaya

486
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:20,958
by the scar across his face.

487
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,333
Scar, scar.

488
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,291
Scar, scar.

489
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:56,458
Go away, Rakshasa assholes.

490
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:08,000
Scar, scar.

491
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:10,333
What are you?

492
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:14,250
Phya Watchara,

493
00:57:14,416 --> 00:57:16,875
my mistress wanted me
to deliver this to you.

494
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:22,833
The entrance map. Who is your mistress?

495
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,041
Kanoknaree.

496
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:28,750
Kanoknaree? It's really her.

497
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:30,708
Wait.

498
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:33,875
I have something for your mistress.

499
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:38,375
Gift, gift.

500
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,208
Were you successful?

501
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:44,833
Did you find him?

502
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:48,750
Gift, gift.

503
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:52,208
It's really you.

504
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,041
According to the map,

505
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:28,333
this waterfall
is the entrance to the Kinnara kingdom.

506
00:58:28,416 --> 00:58:30,166
We're all going in at the same time.

507
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:42,250
Hold hands so we don't get separated.

508
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:52,750
Hold my hand, not my mouth!

509
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,125
Come on, same thing.

510
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:14,666
Invaders!

511
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:17,916
Men, take control of the tower!

512
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,166
Yikes! My wings aren't spreading.

513
00:59:43,416 --> 00:59:46,250
Cover me! I'll deactivate this.

514
01:00:10,916 --> 01:00:12,500
Sir!

515
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:16,083
They're relentless in their attack
We're going to fall.

516
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:17,791
A little longer.

517
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:19,708
I've almost deactivated this.

518
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:21,125
Almost there.

519
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,416
I did it!

520
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:40,625
Phya Watchara is here, sir.

521
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:53,958
I can't believe

522
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,291
that after we moved out here,

523
01:00:57,375 --> 01:01:00,208
a bloodthirsty species like yours

524
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:02,416
would still come attack us.

525
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:04,333
Go ahead,

526
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:05,833
I've lost.

527
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:08,375
Have your way with us.

528
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:22,291
Please accept my respect, Your Majesty,

529
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:25,000
King of all Kinnara.

530
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:26,958
We come here in peace.

531
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:30,000
And yes, our ancestors used to
attack you and your people.

532
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,541
But I never thought
it was the right thing to do.

533
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:39,708
Ayothaya was attacked by the Rakshasa
and we fled here.

534
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:45,500
I humbly request your strong Kinnara army
to be our allies

535
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,708
in taking back Ayothaya.

536
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:50,375
It wasn't my intention
to invade your kingdom.

537
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:54,750
All right, I accept your goodwill.

538
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:58,000
As for being your allies,

539
01:01:58,333 --> 01:02:01,500
I can't make that decision on my own.

540
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:03,083
This is a serious matter

541
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:06,250
that concerns the life and death
of our species,

542
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:10,416
so it must be discussed
with my military commanders.

543
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,875
I can't give you an answer right now,

544
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:15,791
not until we have met
and come to a decision.

545
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:19,666
I really appreciate it, Your Majesty.

546
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:21,916
I await your decision.

547
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:23,791
No matter what the decision is,

548
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:26,541
we'll gladly accept it

549
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:29,500
and treat you with the respect
you deserve as King.

550
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:46,125
Kanoknaree, I came here to help you.

551
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:48,208
You.

552
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:59,333
That girl looks good enough
to be a royal dancer.

553
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,333
Catch her and bring her
to the royal palace. Hurry.

554
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:05,791
-Come be a royal dancer.
-No!

555
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:09,583
-No! Let go of me!
-Come!

556
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:12,000
Help! Somebody help me!

557
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,750
Kanoknaree?

558
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,041
My dear!

559
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:20,250
Hey, you think you can escape?

560
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:32,208
Help! Let go of me!

561
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:35,250
Stop! Let go!

562
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:37,000
Let her go!

563
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,541
Kid, move! Move out of the way!

564
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:41,583
No!

565
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:43,833
-You're asking for trouble.
-Let's show him.

566
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:57,583
Buddhaisawan sword pose!

567
01:04:07,416 --> 01:04:08,416
No!

568
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:10,875
Kanoknaree, I'm here.

569
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:13,916
-Father!
-Catch that impudent slave!

570
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:19,333
No! Let go of me!

571
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:21,625
Father! Help!

572
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,250
No!

573
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:38,958
I've been holding on to this for 200 years

574
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:42,250
with the hope of returning it
back to its owner.

575
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:46,791
I've been dreaming of you every night
since that day.

576
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,083
I never thought

577
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:52,291
that we'd ever have the chance
to meet again.

578
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,583
What an amazing invention!

579
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:14,416
If my father decides to join forces,

580
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:19,708
I'll ask him to create one
for each of you. Okay?

581
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:22,541
That would be amazing.

582
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:25,208
As wingless Garuda,

583
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:27,166
we are like tigers without claws.

584
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,291
Can your father really create
mechanical wings for all of us?

585
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:36,375
He's been an excellent craftsman
since the time he was a slave.

586
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,583
The Great Sanphet Royal Palace in Ayothaya

587
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:41,500
was entirely made by my father.

588
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:44,166
I remember as a child,

589
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,875
before the major Kinnara evacuation,

590
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:51,458
I snuck into the secret evacuation tunnel
one night.

591
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:56,125
I saw my father making
a huge and complex invention.

592
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,208
He said

593
01:05:58,291 --> 01:06:01,500
it was a deadly weapon.

594
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:08,166
I hope we'll never need it,

595
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:11,291
because it's unimaginably powerful.

596
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,458
What is the invention?

597
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:14,708
It is...

598
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:29,833
Look! A smoke signal!

599
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,333
Look at the smoke carefully.

600
01:06:35,416 --> 01:06:37,250
If it resembles a Kinnari,

601
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:40,375
it means they don't agree
to be your allies.

602
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:43,666
But if it looks like a Garuda,
then they agree.

603
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:51,500
No!

604
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:52,958
Wait.

605
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:55,333
There's another one.

606
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:00,666
-What does that mean?
-I don't know, either.

607
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:03,666
Well, then we should go ask
for clarification. Let's go.

608
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:10,041
Your Majesty, what do those
smoke signals mean?

609
01:07:10,166 --> 01:07:13,208
The council didn't come
to a unanimous decision.

610
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:14,166
So...

611
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:17,916
I accept your offer and agree to join you

612
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,916
as a favor
for helping my daughter in the past.

613
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,333
Thank you, Your Majesty.

614
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,250
But listen,

615
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:29,125
I have two conditions.

616
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:31,083
First,

617
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:34,250
only Kinnara will be involved
in this battle.

618
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:36,666
No Kinnari are allowed.

619
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:39,583
-Especially you, Kanoknaree.
-But, Father--

620
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:41,125
I agree.

621
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:42,458
And the other condition?

622
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:47,125
After we take back Ayothaya,

623
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,333
you and your Garuda

624
01:07:49,416 --> 01:07:55,083
will never set foot on
or invade Himmaphan Forest!

625
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:24,250
Kanoknaree, we'll probably never see 
each other again in this life.

626
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:44,041
Payuha, take the wheel.

627
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:45,666
Lower all sails.

628
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:49,083
Sir, we're stuck on a rock
and can't go any further.

629
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,125
Some of our boats have sunk.

630
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:53,291
Tell the oarsmen
to get the boats out of here

631
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,291
-before they sink.
-Yes, sir.

632
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:02,916
The oars are stuck.

633
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:04,375
We can't move.

634
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:09,625
I'd like to volunteer
to investigate underwater.

635
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:11,458
Please be careful, Varee.

636
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:39,375
King of the Naga!

637
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:45,708
Anantanagaraj!

638
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:49,625
Hello and goodbye!

639
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:52,833
Come on, Varee. Grab my hand!

640
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,208
Pull me up! Hurry!

641
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:12,000
Oh, shit. What's he doing?

642
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:29,333
How is this possible?

643
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:31,416
It's incredible.

644
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,750
Anantanagaraj said

645
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:42,541
the Rakshasa army
has taken control of every land.

646
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:45,416
They are pouring poison

647
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:47,125
into the Great Sidantara Ocean

648
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:49,500
hoping to destroy
all sea-living creatures.

649
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:54,416
Once the ocean dries up and turns to land,

650
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,875
they will bring their army across
to attack the Himmaphan Forest,

651
01:10:57,958 --> 01:10:59,958
the last territory to conquer,

652
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:02,416
and take over the whole world.

653
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:06,875
Anantanagaraj, we're evacuating
your Naga to a safe place

654
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:11,041
and shall deliver this dire news
to the Himmaphan Forest.

655
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:15,666
My soldiers and I will stop this disaster.

656
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,458
At the cost of your lives,

657
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:20,166
we will go on to attack
and crush the Rakshasa.

658
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:23,833
We will take back Ayothaya!

659
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:36,291
These Garuda are so weak.

660
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,958
Since you're no longer useful...

661
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,416
Attack!

662
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,416
Split into three groups.

663
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,458
We'll attack simultaneously!

664
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:46,416
Fire wall!

665
01:12:57,416 --> 01:13:00,708
Watch out for the fire wall. Go around!

666
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:57,375
Men, spread out and find the Dark Monster.

667
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:58,625
Yes, sir.

668
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:49,958
The bastard took ordinary Garuda
as hostages.

669
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:58,291
Ayothaya's gold taste really good.

670
01:14:58,416 --> 01:14:59,291
Dark Monster!

671
01:15:01,583 --> 01:15:04,250
You shall die!

672
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:20,291
Put down your weapons,

673
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:24,500
or I'll pour this oil
and kill these Garuda.

674
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:49,458
Varee!

675
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:27,250
Help! It's hot!

676
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,791
Hang in there, Varee.

677
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:31,291
You can't die.

678
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:36,625
You must take back Ayothaya.

679
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,458
Vayu.

680
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,583
No! No!

681
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:06,791
Varee!

682
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:31,666
You. Who are you?

683
01:17:45,041 --> 01:17:46,375
How are you holding up?

684
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:49,708
Kanoknaree? How did you get here?

685
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:53,500
I left the Himmaphan Forest
disguised as a Garuda.

686
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:57,291
You didn't notice
there was one extra soldier in your army.

687
01:17:58,166 --> 01:18:00,416
How stupid of me.

688
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,458
I'm impressed you found a way
into this secret tunnel.

689
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:06,625
Remember, my father, Kinnarajan,

690
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,875
built the Sanphet Palace,

691
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:14,333
we made our escape
through this very tunnel 200 years ago.

692
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:20,416
Kanoknaree, I'm so glad
to see you once again.

693
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,750
If you hadn't come to my aid,

694
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:25,250
I would have been killed
by the Dark Monster.

695
01:18:26,791 --> 01:18:29,541
The tunnel is collapsing.
Let's get out of here!

696
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:33,333
Wait. I remember something.

697
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:37,083
In this tunnel,
my father left an invention

698
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:38,958
from before our evacuation.

699
01:18:39,041 --> 01:18:41,333
I came here to find it.

700
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:45,625
There's no time. Let's go.

701
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:47,708
Hot!

702
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:51,583
Help! Help!

703
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:09,125
What?

704
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:30,291
The Naga are here to help us!

705
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,166
Attack!

706
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:02,625
To my surprise, they didn't come after me.

707
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:05,083
They just stood there watching.

708
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:27,916
Varee sacrificed himself for us.

709
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:31,666
We must take back Ayothaya!

710
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:33,416
Hang in there.

711
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:36,083
Our mission is not yet accomplished.

712
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:52,916
It's still alive?

713
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:57,000
Wait here. I'll take him.

714
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:48,916
Aim!

715
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:29,916
Nothing seems to hurt him.

716
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:33,000
Sir, let me try again.

717
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:40,291
Don't you test me,

718
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:42,500
Anantanagaraj.

719
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:07,000
Pirun!

720
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:38,791
You.

721
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:10,958
Kanoknaree!

722
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:18,166
Kanoknaree!

723
01:24:22,708 --> 01:24:25,333
Kanoknaree. Kanoknaree! No!

724
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,375
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

725
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:49,625
No! Kanoknaree! You'll be fine.

726
01:24:57,375 --> 01:24:59,125
There.

727
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:01,666
-Our hope.
-What is it?

728
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:06,125
Do you remember
I told you about my father's invention

729
01:25:06,208 --> 01:25:09,708
that I saw when I was a child?

730
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:12,291
I built this killing machine just in case.

731
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:15,333
If the Garuda catch us
during the evacuation,

732
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:18,291
they'll have to kill us all.

733
01:25:18,416 --> 01:25:22,750
Whenever a Kinnara's blood
flows into its mechanism,

734
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:26,333
this weapon will appear

735
01:25:26,416 --> 01:25:28,833
and destroy all of Ayothaya.

736
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,750
Luckily, at that time,

737
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:34,291
there was no need to use it.

738
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:37,250
The evacuation was successful.

739
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:21,916
The time has come, Watchara.

740
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:25,125
Aim this arrow towards the target

741
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:29,291
through the eye of the killing machine.

742
01:26:29,416 --> 01:26:32,375
This arrow will control the direction

743
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:34,916
of its destructive power.

744
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:38,750
Remember, you only have one chance.

745
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:41,083
I... I...

746
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:44,583
Kanoknaree! No!

747
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:45,833
No!

748
01:26:45,916 --> 01:26:47,583
Don't leave me!

749
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:17,000
Aim this arrow towards the target

750
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:19,208
through the eye of the killing machine.

751
01:27:19,416 --> 01:27:22,250
This arrow will control the direction

752
01:27:22,333 --> 01:27:24,666
of its destructive power.

753
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:33,166
Remember, you only have one chance.

754
01:27:41,041 --> 01:27:43,958
You missed, Phya Watchara!

755
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:19,208
Buddhaisawan sword pose!

756
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:53,916
Finally, the Dark Monster is killed.

757
01:29:55,333 --> 01:29:59,625
The Garuda can take back their kingdom.

758
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:02,458
Once the war ends,

759
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:05,583
all are saddened

760
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:09,833
to see the once-exquisite Ayothaya

761
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:13,041
reduced to rubble

762
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:16,500
with mountains of corpses.

763
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:20,041
Even more depressing

764
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:24,958
is the news that King Subunpon

765
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:27,958
was among the prisoners

766
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:31,166
driven to the kingdom of the Rakshasa.

767
01:30:31,416 --> 01:30:34,708
No one news has been heard of him since.

768
01:30:49,916 --> 01:30:54,083
One day,
I'll lead our army to attack the Rakshasa

769
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:57,541
and rescue King Subunpon.

770
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,666
Good luck. Bye-bye.

771
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:08,166
Bye.

772
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:10,583
-See you.
-Bye.

773
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,041
I feel sad

774
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:19,916
that we lost so many
brave Himmaphan soldiers

775
01:31:20,125 --> 01:31:22,583
who fought alongside us.

776
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:38,416
All wars,

777
01:31:39,083 --> 01:31:43,875
even the ones waged for a just cause,
are cruel.

778
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:50,375
When will all living beings
learn how to live together peacefully?

779
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,916
Eventually,

780
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,250
Ayothaya is restored
to her former exquisite glory.

781
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:16,375
Statues of the Himmaphan creatures

782
01:32:16,458 --> 01:32:18,625
that fought to regain Ayothaya

783
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:21,750
are placed at the city's gates,

784
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:24,500
the palace steps, temples

785
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:27,375
and other buildings.

786
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:31,208
That's why you see
sculptures of Kochasri...

787
01:32:33,083 --> 01:32:34,416
Norasingha...

788
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:38,583
Naga...

789
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,375
Kinnara...

790
01:32:44,333 --> 01:32:45,958
Kinnari...

791
01:32:48,166 --> 01:32:50,250
and Garuda adorning Ayothaya.

792
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:54,375
It is to commemorate their bravery

793
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:57,875
during that Great War

794
01:32:58,333 --> 01:33:00,083
even until today.

795
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:05,291
After Phya Watchara

796
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:09,583
was enthroned as King,

797
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:14,541
he waged countless wars
against the Rakshasa

798
01:33:14,625 --> 01:33:17,416
until he was killed on the battlefield.

799
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:23,250
He couldn't help the former King,

800
01:33:23,625 --> 01:33:27,541
once his master, who remains in prison

801
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:29,125
even until today,

802
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:33,250
over a thousand years later.

803
01:33:46,875 --> 01:33:51,916
"SUBUNPON"
