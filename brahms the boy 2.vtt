[siren wailing in distance]

01:19.947 --> 01:22.783
[siren grows louder]

01:23.684 --> 01:25.753
[siren fades]

01:28.289 --> 01:29.190
Jude?

01:30.258 --> 01:31.959
[beeping]

01:31.992 --> 01:34.162
Jude. I'm home.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.763
[beeping continues]

01:37.631 --> 01:38.799
[sustained beep]

01:43.036 --> 01:44.972
Turn off the video games.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.040
[keys clattering]

01:56.884 --> 01:58.486
[singsongy] Jude.

01:59.820 --> 02:00.621
Gotcha!

02:02.356 --> 02:03.691
-[roars]
-[squeals]

02:03.724 --> 02:05.526
Shit!
[giggles]

02:05.559 --> 02:09.029
[scoffs] Another prank?
Why do you have to
keep doing this?

02:09.062 --> 02:10.631
I got you good, didn't I?

02:10.664 --> 02:12.200
You think
you're funny, huh?

02:12.233 --> 02:14.202
Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Okay.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.370
-[phone buzzes]
-Saved by your dad.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.207
-Hi.
-Dad.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.974
What's up, mate?

02:21.008 --> 02:23.043
You being the big man
of the house and taking care
of your mum?

02:23.076 --> 02:24.845
More like scaring
his old mom.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.447
I used the shoe trick.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.716
The shoe trick.
Now, let me see.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.685
No, I think
you must be mistaking me
with someone else, mate.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.787
Real sneaky, you two.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.323
I can't stay long, love.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.525
I've gotta take some clients
out for dinner.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.960
But I just wanted to check in
on my two favorite people,

02:39.993 --> 02:42.730
and let you know
that I miss you both
and I love you guys so much.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.332
Love you, Dad.
Bye, kiddo.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.266
Later!

02:47.201 --> 02:50.504
You know, it's the third time
this week you've been late.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.340
I know, I know.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.342
I've just got to
finish these deadlines,
then I'm done. I promise.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.009
When I get back,

02:56.043 --> 02:59.179
maybe I can find a way
to make it up to you.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.382
Well, Friday night,
we do have the nanny.

03:01.415 --> 03:04.552
Oh. Well, then I will see you
on Friday night, lady.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.421
If you're lucky.
[chuckles]

03:07.455 --> 03:09.056
-Night.
-Good night, love.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.693
Were you really scared, Mom?

03:13.894 --> 03:15.829
I was.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.698
But next time,
let's get your dad.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.701
[sighs] Okay.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.704
Looks like Mr. Brown
could use a cuddle.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.008
Mom.
Hmm?

03:28.041 --> 03:30.344
I'm too old to still sleep
with a teddy bear.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.413
Well, I won't tell
if you won't.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.448
Good night.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.484
Good night, Mom.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.900
[door closes]

03:54.435 --> 03:56.003
[floor creaking]

04:01.942 --> 04:02.943
[thudding]

04:07.915 --> 04:09.517
[clattering]

04:22.330 --> 04:23.364
Jude?

04:37.378 --> 04:38.812
[loud clattering]

05:07.408 --> 05:10.143
If you're trying
to scare me again,
it's not funny.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.081
Okay.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.657
Mom!

05:23.691 --> 05:25.092
What are you doing?
[scoffs]

05:25.826 --> 05:26.727
Mom, don't!

05:27.561 --> 05:29.730
[screaming]

05:30.831 --> 05:33.901
[screaming continues]

05:33.934 --> 05:35.836
-No! No!
-[alarm blaring]

05:35.869 --> 05:36.770
Jude!

05:38.372 --> 05:39.339
Jude!

05:40.441 --> 05:42.376
[shouting]

05:44.545 --> 05:46.514
-[shouting continues]
-[man groans]

05:49.082 --> 05:51.351
Mommy!

06:09.970 --> 06:12.372
[woman]
I thought we could take a look
at some of those toys today.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.911
Or perhaps there's something
you'd like to talk about?

06:23.784 --> 06:26.386
You don't like coming here
very much, do you?

06:30.658 --> 06:32.660
But you do understand
why you're here?

06:37.064 --> 06:39.099
You know, Jude,
if you'd like to go,

06:39.132 --> 06:41.569
all you need to do is to say,
"I'd like to go now."

06:51.178 --> 06:54.915
Five months isn't
an unusual time for this kind
of selective mutism.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.551
I've seen children
stop talking for much longer

06:57.585 --> 07:00.087
from much less severe trauma.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.556
Encourage him to communicate,
but try not to force it.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.391
It has to come from him.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.860
The more we force things,
the more he's gonna pull back.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.930
And how are the two of you
holding up?

07:11.364 --> 07:13.166
We're good, yeah.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.135
As well as we can be.

07:17.304 --> 07:20.574
We're really just trying
to focus on Jude's recovery
right now.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.676
Well, I commend
your dedication.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.845
But Jude is looking
to you now.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.648
And if you're
not getting better,
he won't get better.

07:30.818 --> 07:31.785
Thank you.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.505
[sighs]

07:52.339 --> 07:53.574
Another headache?

07:57.177 --> 07:58.546
It's not that bad.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.021
I thought the doctor
had some good things to say.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.357
Yeah.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.328
I think Jude
is a little better.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.866
No. I meant, actually,
about us healing too.

08:21.234 --> 08:24.337
Well, I'm... fine, really.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.007
You never leave the house.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.377
You have nightmares
every night,

08:31.612 --> 08:33.814
and you don't even
let me touch you.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.350
I'm... not having
this conversation again.

08:37.384 --> 08:40.888
We've never had
this conversation.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.591
You've never talked about
what happened or how you feel.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.662
What if we went away?

08:48.696 --> 08:50.631
Out of the city,
someplace quiet.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.668
You're already
homeschooling Jude.
I can work wherever.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.304
I think it would be
a good chance for us
to have a fresh start.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.613
I'll think about it.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.554
What is it, sweetheart?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.076
[gasps]

09:36.109 --> 09:38.612
-Liza!
-[choking]

09:38.646 --> 09:39.913
Liza, be quiet!

09:39.947 --> 09:40.914
Liza.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.082
Liza.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.784
Liza. Liza. It's okay.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.385
[Liza gasping]

09:45.418 --> 09:47.520
It's okay. You're all right.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.491
[Jude crying softly]

09:51.524 --> 09:53.426
[Liza]
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.663
It's okay.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.435
[whispering]
I can't do this anymore.

10:27.728 --> 10:31.064
[chain squeaking]

10:40.908 --> 10:42.609
Hiya! I'm Pamela.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.012
Oh, I'm glad you found it.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.613
Shall I show you the house?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.215
And what's
this little man's name?

10:48.248 --> 10:49.649
[Liza] Jude.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.451
He's a little shy.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.687
[Pamela]
Oh, well, I bet we'll be
best of friends in no time.

10:55.723 --> 10:58.358
This used to be a guesthouse
of a much larger property.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.660
But after the owner of
the manor house passed away,

11:00.694 --> 11:03.731
some city man, no offense,
came and scooped it up.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.332
I think
he was gonna restore it,

11:05.365 --> 11:07.467
but I imagine the job
got too much for him.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.169
Lucky for you folks,
though.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.403
Some time
in the countryside.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.839
It's perfect.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.340
I'll give you a little tour
if you like.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.176
No. I think we can
handle it from here.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.711
Oh. All right.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.412
Thank you.
Take care.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.848
Cheers. Bye-bye.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.919
[door opens, closes]

11:25.953 --> 11:28.088
So, what do you think?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.489
It's beautiful.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.391
Yeah? You sure?
Yes.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.561
And what about you,
big boss?

11:35.528 --> 11:36.429
[chuckles]

11:37.130 --> 11:38.631
All right.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.601
I vote we try a little...

11:43.036 --> 11:44.571
nature exploration!

11:46.273 --> 11:48.375
-[man] Isn't it beautiful?
-[Liza] Yeah, it's so quiet.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.476
Look at the sun.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.914
Smell the air.
That's fresh air.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.217
I bet we'll see loads
of rabbits come spring.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.319
-Maybe even some deer, huh?
-[Liza] Yeah.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.456
[man]
Watch your step, mate.
It's slippery.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.065
[Liza] What's that?

12:12.099 --> 12:13.600
That must be
the main house.

12:15.668 --> 12:16.770
Let's check it out.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.990
Look at that.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.459
Wow. Now, that is
what I call a house.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.593
Come here.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.164
Come on, Jude.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.465
[child's voice, faint]
Jude.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.466
Wow.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.271
This place must've
been quite something
back in the day.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.372
"Glennview Estate."

12:54.107 --> 12:56.443
[child's voice]
Jude, come play with us.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.180
Jude.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.818
Come here, Jude. Over here.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.286
Jude.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.021
Come over here.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.962
Now, Jude.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.167
We'll have to look it up.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.235
Old house like this probably
got some real history to it.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.374
[chuckling] Sean.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.449
Jude, Jude. Help me, Jude.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.885
Jude, Jude, Jude.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.222
Yes, Jude.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.173
[Sean]
Yeah, forget the guesthouse.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.574
I'm moving in here.

14:01.608 --> 14:02.842
What do you say, Jude?

14:03.676 --> 14:04.577
Jude?

14:06.914 --> 14:08.415
Jude!
Jude?

14:09.516 --> 14:10.417
Jude!

14:11.919 --> 14:13.653
Mate, don't run off
like that, please.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.923
You can't run off like that,
not out here.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.591
What's that?

14:18.625 --> 14:19.792
Did you just find that?

14:21.094 --> 14:22.029
Can I take a look?

14:23.931 --> 14:26.533
Oh, my goodness.
It's filthy. Look at it.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.069
Whereabouts
did you find it?

14:32.305 --> 14:33.740
Do you wanna keep it?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.944
Okay. Let's get it
cleaned up first.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.881
All right. Can't wait to have
this guy in the house.

15:05.072 --> 15:05.973
Can I see?

15:09.076 --> 15:10.110
"Rules."

15:12.079 --> 15:12.980
Huh.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.254
I bet you have
a story to tell.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.160
Looks like
he wants a friend.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.282
He looks like
he was broken before...

15:53.120 --> 15:54.988
and put back together again.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.130
Okay, let's go to bed now.
Hmm?

16:04.897 --> 16:06.666
Come on, mate.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.668
You sure you got everything
you need there, little fella?
Yeah?

16:08.701 --> 16:10.770
You just
make yourself at home.
Put your feet up.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.472
There's nice, cold beer
in the fridge.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.807
I could use
some of those pj's.

16:14.841 --> 16:15.875
[Liza chuckles]

16:53.946 --> 16:57.950
[piano: "Brahms Lullaby"]

17:15.368 --> 17:18.071
["Brahms Lullaby" continues]

17:25.612 --> 17:27.280
You dressed him yourself.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.987
That sounds lovely.

17:39.126 --> 17:39.992
Are you hungry?

17:41.461 --> 17:42.429
Okay.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.833
I'll make pancakes.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.640
["Brahms Lullaby" continues]

17:58.745 --> 18:02.915
I guess it's about time for me
to start my morning commute,

18:02.949 --> 18:06.253
all the way down the hallway.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.455
I really hope
there's no traffic, guys.

18:08.488 --> 18:11.558
You wanna stop by the office
for lunch today?

18:11.591 --> 18:14.827
Did I mention that I was
just down the hallway?

18:14.861 --> 18:16.396
I'll try to sneak by.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.997
Goodbye, Judester.
Mwah.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.600
And goodbye, uh...

18:21.534 --> 18:23.370
Did we come up
with a name for him yet?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.207
[pen scratching on paper]

18:30.810 --> 18:32.845
"Brahms." Wow.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.282
Like the composer?

18:35.315 --> 18:37.217
That's quite the name.
How'd you come up with that?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.760
Oh, he told you.
Right, yeah.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.462
Well, of course, he did.
Silly me.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.665
All right. Bye, gang.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.467
Goodbye, Brahms.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.537
Well, what should we
start with today,

18:57.570 --> 18:59.005
math or history?

19:01.341 --> 19:02.209
[door closes]

19:07.814 --> 19:08.715
Okay.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.025
[child's voice] Over here.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.327
[Liza] Wait up!

19:22.862 --> 19:24.063
Right here.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.401
This way.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.845
Jude!

19:38.878 --> 19:41.248
I told you not
to run off like that.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.654
This is where you found him?

19:47.687 --> 19:48.888
-[barking]
-[screams]

19:52.725 --> 19:54.327
Oz, get in here.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.496
This is private property.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.365
I'm sorry. We're staying
at the guesthouse.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.032
We were just on a walk.
I didn't know.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.934
Of course you didn't.
You're the new family.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.537
Sorry, I get a lot of people
snooping around up here.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.606
I'm Joseph. Joe.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.442
Um, I tend the grounds
around here.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.644
Part guard, part gardener.
This is Oz.
[Oz whimpers]

20:12.279 --> 20:13.546
I'm Liza.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.282
And this is Jude.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.951
[Oz growling]

20:18.985 --> 20:21.288
[growling continues]

20:21.321 --> 20:23.556
We can put the doll back.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.392
Do you want us--

20:25.425 --> 20:26.759
No, no, no, no.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.130
Keep it. No one's
gonna miss it out here.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.099
Just me and Oz these days.

20:33.132 --> 20:34.767
Unless, of course,
you'd like to put it back?

20:36.969 --> 20:38.638
He's a little quiet.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.741
Don't worry about that.
Not much of a talker meself.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.278
People think I'm crazy
for living out here on my own,

20:45.312 --> 20:47.280
but I'm more sane
than any of them.

20:47.314 --> 20:50.417
The real crazies are living
in the city, packed together
like a bunch of cattle.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.118
Thank you,
but no, thank you.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.821
You didn't really have to
walk us all the way back.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.789
Ah, I don't mind.
We're neighbors now.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.658
I suppose I'll be seeing
quite a bit of you.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.826
[Sean] Hey there.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.429
That's a healthy-looking
12 gauge.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.430
Or a 12 bore.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.966
I was worried about you.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.435
This is Joseph.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.470
Joseph, this is
my husband, Sean.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.071
Hiya.
Joseph--

21:12.104 --> 21:14.307
I tend the grounds round here.
Keep the troublemakers out.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.008
Caught these two red-handed.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.444
Yeah, these two are trouble,
all right.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.812
Well, thanks
for escorting them back.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.851
Right. I'll be off, then.
Let me know if you
need anything, yeah?

21:25.852 --> 21:27.687
Yeah. Nice meeting you.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.955
Pleasure was all mine.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.724
See you soon, little fella.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.964
Bringing home the local strays
already, huh?

21:37.997 --> 21:39.399
He's right there.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.876
[Oz growling]

21:49.909 --> 21:53.179
[Liza] Look, he insisted on
walking us all the way home.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.382
Come on, Oz. Come on.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.749
Nice of him, I guess.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.987
Who the hell buries a doll
in the woods like that?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.955
Maybe some weird little kid
put it there.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.290
I don't know, sweetheart.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.493
Yeah, but you weren't there.
You didn't see it.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.928
His entire wardrobe,
in this...

22:10.196 --> 22:11.798
coffin thing.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.033
Okay.
So, what do you wanna do?

22:16.369 --> 22:18.738
-You wanna take the doll
away from him?
-Yes.

22:20.407 --> 22:21.374
No.

22:24.611 --> 22:25.978
I don't know.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.347
I just think
it's all a little bit...

22:28.381 --> 22:29.382
creepy.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.386
I really don't think
it's the doll
that's the problem here.

22:34.286 --> 22:36.389
What does that mean?

22:36.423 --> 22:38.357
Nothing. Let's just
finish the dishes, yeah?

22:38.391 --> 22:39.859
I've got some work to do
before we go to sleep.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.397
No, I wanna hear
what you were about to say.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.033
What's the problem?

22:50.369 --> 22:53.773
Sometimes I feel like
you use Jude...

22:55.442 --> 22:59.045
to avoid talking about
what happened to you.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.247
And I don't think
that's healthy
for either of you.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.056
[Jude's voice] Mommy!

23:11.991 --> 23:13.593
You know, I nearly died...

23:15.394 --> 23:17.597
in some random,
senseless burglary.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.100
And I'm actually aware of that
every single day of my life.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.035
Yes, but that's over now.
[kettle whistling]

23:23.069 --> 23:24.303
Li--

23:29.108 --> 23:30.977
[Jude] Dogs bark.
You didn't like the dog?

23:33.813 --> 23:35.081
The dog.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.148
Dogs bark.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.952
I know what you mean.
He was kind of scary.

23:39.986 --> 23:40.987
Liza, I'm sorry.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.254
Shh, shh, shh.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.128
[Jude chattering]

23:49.161 --> 23:50.497
Holy shit.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.634
Should we just
leave him alone?
Do you wanna open the door?

23:54.667 --> 23:56.603
No, I wanna go in. I wanna
see if he'll talk to us.

23:56.636 --> 23:57.770
Okay. Let's go.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.206
So, all this is yours?

24:01.140 --> 24:02.975
[Liza] Hey, sweetheart.

24:03.009 --> 24:06.312
We were just outside,
and we thought we heard
you talking.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.515
Were you talking
to Brahms?

24:10.650 --> 24:12.151
Great.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.553
So, what were you guys
talking about?

24:23.395 --> 24:24.964
The dog from this morning.

24:24.997 --> 24:25.865
Did he scare you?

24:35.908 --> 24:37.109
[Sean]
"Brahms doesn't like him."

24:37.143 --> 24:38.044
Oh.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.847
Well, that's...

24:42.014 --> 24:43.049
that's great.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.253
We'll let you get back
to Brahms.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.658
Good night.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.994
Thinking about
watching a movie,
if you're interested.

25:00.432 --> 25:01.367
Oh, yeah.

25:01.901 --> 25:02.835
Sure.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.511
I guess we're
keeping that doll.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.847
Are you kidding?
I love that creepy thing.
[chuckling]

25:14.881 --> 25:18.117
[growling]

25:24.090 --> 25:26.793
[growling continues]

25:31.230 --> 25:35.635
[creaking]

25:43.475 --> 25:46.112
[faint whispering]

26:12.939 --> 26:15.007
[whispering continues]

26:17.944 --> 26:19.245
[whispering stops]

26:25.417 --> 26:26.485
[screams]

26:26.518 --> 26:29.588
[gasps]
[man grunting]

26:29.622 --> 26:31.958
Liza, it's okay.
Honey, it's okay.
Look at me.

26:32.524 --> 26:34.160
It was just a dream.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.395
Look at me.
It's fine. You're okay.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.798
[panting]
Jude.

26:38.831 --> 26:39.932
Jude, I'm sorry.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.868
He's mine!

26:44.136 --> 26:45.137
You okay?
Another nightmare?

26:46.305 --> 26:47.640
Where's Jude?

26:47.674 --> 26:49.008
He slept in his room,
love.

26:53.312 --> 26:54.213
[Liza sighs]

26:59.551 --> 27:01.620
This is the first time
he's slept in his own bed.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.292
[kisses] Come on.

27:06.325 --> 27:07.459
Let's go back to bed.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.301
[door closes]

27:22.408 --> 27:25.544
[Oz whining]

27:28.480 --> 27:30.116
[Sean] Here you go.
Do you want two, yeah?

27:30.149 --> 27:31.718
Does Brahms want two?

27:33.219 --> 27:35.387
Hey, good morning.
You're up.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.156
I let you lie in.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.891
It seemed like
you could use it.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.463
Thank you.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.431
Cooked up
a little Full English.

27:46.432 --> 27:47.366
Here you go, love.

27:49.936 --> 27:52.171
What's this?
Oh, that. Yes.

27:52.204 --> 27:56.308
Well, apparently, Brahms
is handing down rules now,

27:56.342 --> 27:58.244
including
he'd like his own food.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.586
"Always and forever"?

28:48.627 --> 28:50.562
Oh, dear.

28:50.596 --> 28:52.098
What happened
to Mr. Brown?

28:54.466 --> 28:57.069
Jude, buddy,

28:57.837 --> 28:58.905
did you do this?

29:01.607 --> 29:02.809
Come on, mate.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.877
It's not very nice
to blame him now, is it?

29:04.911 --> 29:07.713
Look, we're not mad at you.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.016
But this is no way
to treat your things.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.920
And it's never okay to lie.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.288
So, did you cut up
Mr. Brown?

29:20.793 --> 29:23.595
Okay. Then why don't you
go to your room and finish
your homework there?

29:23.629 --> 29:25.631
And then when you're ready
to tell me what happened,
you can come out.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.777
You can leave
the doll here.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.513
[Sean] Jude.

29:41.547 --> 29:42.982
You heard your mum.
Leave the doll, please.

29:58.530 --> 30:01.167
Maybe it's a good thing.
He's getting his anger out.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.936
[door creaks, closes]

30:03.970 --> 30:05.537
It's pretty violent.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.412
[static hissing]

30:47.914 --> 30:49.615
[hissing continues]

31:14.540 --> 31:15.774
Really?

31:22.814 --> 31:24.383
That wasn't funny.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.385
You're supposed
to stay in this room

31:26.418 --> 31:28.921
and not come out again until
you're ready to apologize.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.999
Fine. You can stay in here
for the rest of the day, then.

32:20.639 --> 32:21.540
Aaah!

32:24.110 --> 32:25.644
[sighs]

32:28.380 --> 32:29.815
[exhales]

32:48.000 --> 32:50.969
[rhythmic thumping]

32:53.839 --> 32:56.175
[footsteps]

32:58.710 --> 33:00.046
[running footsteps]

33:00.079 --> 33:01.313
[door closes]

33:01.347 --> 33:02.314
[lock clicks]

33:02.348 --> 33:03.949
Jude,

33:03.982 --> 33:05.884
your father and I
said no doll.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.057
Okay, I am gonna
count to three,
and if this door isn't open...

33:12.191 --> 33:13.459
One...

33:13.492 --> 33:14.826
two...

33:14.860 --> 33:15.761
three.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.936
[gasps]
What are you doing here?

33:48.894 --> 33:51.130
[knocking]

33:54.366 --> 33:55.601
[Sean] Hey.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.269
I have someone here
who wants to apologize.

33:59.037 --> 33:59.938
Come on.

34:02.441 --> 34:03.309
Hey.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.923
Thank you for apologizing.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.798
Okay. Let's get you
to bed, yeah?

34:26.832 --> 34:28.267
Go brush your teeth.
Good boy.

34:33.972 --> 34:34.906
You okay?

34:37.476 --> 34:38.977
Not good.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.948
I could've sworn
I saw somebody go
into his room, and then--

34:42.981 --> 34:44.550
You didn't. It's fine.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.017
Honestly, his pranks
are getting out of hand.

34:47.486 --> 34:49.221
Yeah, but I thought
everything would be better

34:49.255 --> 34:51.790
once we got out of the city.

34:55.494 --> 34:56.828
I don't know what to do.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.133
I just feel like
I'm letting you and Jude down.

35:02.268 --> 35:03.902
You're not
letting anyone down.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.305
Please don't be sorry.

35:06.338 --> 35:07.606
You'll feel better
after some sleep.

35:07.639 --> 35:08.640
Yeah.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.476
Good night.

35:10.509 --> 35:11.577
All right.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.511
[sniffles]

35:19.618 --> 35:21.787
[door opens, closes]

35:31.797 --> 35:36.335
I understand that some
of Jude's recent behaviors
would be upsetting.

35:36.368 --> 35:42.107
But the doll clearly is
providing him with a safe
outlet to process his trauma.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.511
Now comes the hard part,
where he might try
to act out some more.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.812
[Sean] Act out?

35:46.845 --> 35:48.347
Listen, what if we just
got rid of the doll?

35:48.380 --> 35:49.948
How bad would that be?

35:49.981 --> 35:51.383
[doctor]
I urge you to be patient

35:51.417 --> 35:53.985
and allow him
to have his friend.

35:54.019 --> 35:57.055
He's found a place
with this doll
where he feels safe.

35:57.088 --> 36:00.158
And the last thing we want
to do is take that away.

36:00.192 --> 36:02.728
I'll send you some links
with further information.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.663
Okay. Sounds good.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.365
Thanks, doc. We'll speak
to you soon, yeah?

36:06.398 --> 36:07.499
Okay. Take care.

36:07.533 --> 36:08.767
[computer beeping]

36:10.569 --> 36:12.471
[Sean] Perfect.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.673
There you go. Nice.

36:17.709 --> 36:18.944
Come on, Jude.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.681
That's it. Once.
Then move it on.

36:22.714 --> 36:23.615
Perfect.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.391
[Joe] Hello, Jude.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.728
What you got there?

37:10.929 --> 37:12.731
Okay.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.099
You thought of a name
for him yet?

37:16.234 --> 37:17.135
What is it?

37:19.505 --> 37:23.008
[pen scratching on paper]

37:26.945 --> 37:28.547
Course it is.

37:28.580 --> 37:32.017
Because that's his name,
isn't it?
What else would it be?

37:34.753 --> 37:37.022
You've scrubbed up well,
little man.

37:40.292 --> 37:42.694
So, I see
you've found yourself
a new family.

37:52.438 --> 37:54.172
[Joe] How're you doing,
little fella?

38:00.779 --> 38:03.114
Just look at that expression
on his face.

38:03.148 --> 38:06.618
It's like he's got a secret
that only he knows.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.622
-[door closes]
-Do you ever notice that?

38:13.525 --> 38:14.960
Can I help you?

38:14.993 --> 38:16.161
Hello there.

38:16.194 --> 38:19.297
I was just looking for Oz,
my daft dog.

38:19.331 --> 38:20.766
We haven't seen him.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.267
All right, never mind.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.869
Pretty good idea
where he'll be, anyway.

38:24.703 --> 38:25.804
Right, I'll be off.

38:27.038 --> 38:27.906
You be good now.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.212
Come on.
It's time to go inside.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.794
[Liza] You left Jude
outside all alone?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.396
[Sean]
I just left him for a second.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.370
[snoring]

39:20.959 --> 39:22.961
[breathing deeply]

40:38.036 --> 40:39.805
[gasps, screaming]

40:39.838 --> 40:41.673
[gasping]

40:41.707 --> 40:43.408
[Jude] What happened?
I'm sorry.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.710
I just saw it.
It was just there.

40:45.977 --> 40:47.646
-I'm sorry.
-[Sean] My God, Liza.

40:47.679 --> 40:48.379
What are you doing?

41:02.528 --> 41:05.196
[typing]

41:16.875 --> 41:18.309
Jude?

41:49.440 --> 41:52.110
"I'll always be with you"?

41:54.045 --> 41:56.181
"They will be sorry."

42:06.091 --> 42:07.458
[gasps]

42:11.897 --> 42:12.798
Sorry.

42:14.265 --> 42:16.067
I didn't know
you were standing there.

42:20.305 --> 42:21.439
Why are you wearing that?

42:26.645 --> 42:27.579
Dinner's in 15.

42:39.324 --> 42:41.793
[footsteps]

42:45.764 --> 42:49.467
[clock chiming]

42:57.175 --> 43:00.178
No. It's just the three of us
for dinner tonight, Jude.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.082
No, not tonight.

43:04.115 --> 43:05.784
Does it really matter,
Liza?

43:15.260 --> 43:16.161
Your mum said no, mate.

43:21.266 --> 43:23.434
So, I was thinking
of inviting Liam out,
and the family.

43:24.803 --> 43:27.773
Felt like maybe
we could use some company.

43:27.806 --> 43:31.677
No? You wanna see
your Uncle Liam, Auntie Mary
and your cousins?

43:31.710 --> 43:34.913
I think it'll be fun.
He's always a good laugh,
isn't he?

43:34.946 --> 43:36.481
I think he'd love
to get out of the city.

43:38.884 --> 43:40.018
Not really guests.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.286
They're family.

43:41.319 --> 43:42.954
Yeah?

43:42.988 --> 43:45.123
Your dad and I make the rules
in this house, not your doll.

43:51.496 --> 43:53.231
Mm-mmm. Eat it.

43:54.666 --> 43:55.967
All right, come on.
Enough.

43:56.001 --> 43:57.535
No, it's fine.

43:57.568 --> 44:00.038
You can sit here
until you decide
you can eat your food.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.810
Just do as your mum says,
please.

44:13.819 --> 44:15.453
[Sean whispering]
Look, I can handle this.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.056
[Liza whispering]
It's okay. It's fine.
You have work to do.

44:35.941 --> 44:38.576
Well, if you
won't talk to me,
will the doll?

44:40.578 --> 44:43.882
That's because Brahms
is not a person.

44:46.217 --> 44:47.986
He's not real.

44:48.019 --> 44:50.856
He doesn't need any food.
You do.

44:58.429 --> 45:01.032
The doll and his rules
do not run this house.

45:14.245 --> 45:16.314
Fine.
Stay here all night, then.

45:25.156 --> 45:27.959
[inhales, exhales]

45:27.993 --> 45:31.496
[loud clattering]

45:32.630 --> 45:33.564
[gasps]

45:47.112 --> 45:48.079
What?

45:50.748 --> 45:52.083
Jude.

45:52.117 --> 45:53.018
Jude.

45:54.419 --> 45:56.421
Liza, what in the hell
happened?

46:09.334 --> 46:11.669
Look, I believe you,
I do.

46:11.702 --> 46:13.471
It's just...

46:13.504 --> 46:17.275
So, some scary drawings.

46:17.308 --> 46:19.811
It's not really surprising,
is it? Considering what
he's been through.

46:20.711 --> 46:22.747
The drawing of the dog.

46:22.780 --> 46:23.815
The dog?

46:24.515 --> 46:25.683
There is no dog here.

46:25.716 --> 46:28.253
There was one. And others.

46:28.286 --> 46:31.689
Sean, there was a drawing
of Jude standing over
our dead bodies

46:31.722 --> 46:33.791
and he was holding a gun.

46:33.825 --> 46:36.962
So you're saying he ripped
pages out of his book?

46:37.829 --> 46:39.164
No, I--

46:40.298 --> 46:41.967
I don't know what happened.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.303
I just know that I want
that doll out of our house.

46:45.336 --> 46:48.273
[Sean]
Look, you need to slow down.
I need to think about this.

46:48.306 --> 46:50.475
[Liza]
No, I don't want it here.

46:50.508 --> 46:52.978
I don't like
what it's doing to Jude.

46:55.981 --> 46:56.814
What?

46:57.849 --> 46:59.650
I mean, all of this.

47:01.219 --> 47:03.288
This is a lot
for a little kid,
don't you think?

47:03.321 --> 47:05.490
This isn't a light table,
for starters.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.493
Are you asking me
if I did this?

47:08.526 --> 47:11.029
Somebody's done this.
You're the only person
in here with him.

47:11.062 --> 47:14.665
[Liza] No! Something
is happening to him.

47:14.699 --> 47:17.202
And it started with that doll.

47:17.235 --> 47:19.905
[Sean] Fine.
We'll get rid of the doll
in the morning, okay?

47:21.672 --> 47:23.875
[Jude] What are we gonna
do about them, Brahms?

47:27.245 --> 47:29.680
Oz! Where are you, boy?

47:40.558 --> 47:43.294
Come here, Oz. Come here, boy.

47:46.731 --> 47:48.967
[flies buzzing]

47:58.376 --> 47:59.777
Oh, Oz.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.724
Lovely. I need that.
Thank you.

48:14.625 --> 48:15.593
Ready?

48:15.626 --> 48:17.428
Yeah. Let's do it.

48:20.798 --> 48:22.067
Morning, mister.

48:24.135 --> 48:25.070
[Liza] No.

48:30.241 --> 48:31.142
Sean.

48:34.312 --> 48:35.280
Jude!

48:36.281 --> 48:37.315
Come on, buddy!

48:37.348 --> 48:38.849
It's not funny, Jude!

48:41.452 --> 48:42.587
I'll go this way.

48:42.620 --> 48:45.256
You head off that way.
Okay.

48:45.290 --> 48:46.624
We'll circle round.
We'll meet back at the house.

48:47.625 --> 48:48.759
Jude!

48:49.794 --> 48:51.262
Jude!

48:51.296 --> 48:52.497
[Sean] Jude!

49:22.360 --> 49:24.229
[flies buzzing]

49:46.017 --> 49:48.386
[voices whispering]

49:54.025 --> 49:56.061
[door closes]
[whispering stops]

49:56.094 --> 49:57.695
[running footsteps]

49:57.728 --> 50:00.065
[faint laughing]

50:03.201 --> 50:04.235
Jude?

50:24.555 --> 50:25.890
[creaking]

50:30.361 --> 50:31.362
Jude?

50:32.530 --> 50:34.232
[faint whispering resumes]

50:34.265 --> 50:35.800
Jude.

50:44.909 --> 50:45.876
Jude?

50:48.113 --> 50:50.047
[voices whispering]

50:50.081 --> 50:52.917
Jude? Is that you?

50:52.950 --> 50:54.485
Jude, what are you doing?

50:55.286 --> 50:56.221
[gasps]

50:58.156 --> 51:00.458
[rodents squeaking]

51:00.491 --> 51:03.094
Jude, where are you?

51:14.805 --> 51:16.073
[chuckling] Look, Mommy.

51:17.842 --> 51:19.009
Over here.

51:21.346 --> 51:23.148
Come play with us, Mommy.

51:26.751 --> 51:28.319
-[bats screeching]
-[Liza screams]

51:30.655 --> 51:33.057
[gasps]

51:33.090 --> 51:35.693
[voices chattering, laughing]

51:46.704 --> 51:48.873
-[scraping]
-[dirt falling]

52:23.508 --> 52:24.709
Jude?

52:43.928 --> 52:47.432
[wood creaking]

52:51.536 --> 52:53.371
[creaking]

53:22.933 --> 53:23.901
Jude.

53:32.610 --> 53:34.345
I'm sorry I scared you.

53:34.379 --> 53:37.415
We were just playing, Mommy.
It's so good
to hear your voice.

53:37.448 --> 53:39.617
[loud thud]

53:46.257 --> 53:47.492
[gasps]

53:48.759 --> 53:50.561
There you are.

53:50.595 --> 53:52.397
Been looking all over for you.
Didn't you hear us calling?

53:52.997 --> 53:55.032
[Liza] No.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.468
[Sean] Jude.
What the hell are you doing
in here? It's not safe.

53:57.502 --> 53:58.436
I'm sorry, Daddy.

53:59.670 --> 54:00.938
Jude, he's--

54:02.139 --> 54:03.408
You're talking.

54:03.441 --> 54:04.975
Right, let's go.

54:05.009 --> 54:06.777
We're not really supposed to
be in this part of the house.

54:06.811 --> 54:07.678
Come on.

54:12.149 --> 54:14.151
[Liza] It's so nice
to hear you talking.

54:24.495 --> 54:26.531
[Liza] Joseph,
what happened in this house?

54:28.366 --> 54:31.302
Jude, why don't you go
show Brahms the music room?

54:32.202 --> 54:33.137
Stay close, mate.

54:34.972 --> 54:35.873
There, uh--

54:37.542 --> 54:41.346
There was a family that
lived here a long time ago.

54:41.379 --> 54:43.514
Had a son, went a bit mad.

54:43.548 --> 54:45.115
Killed a little girl.

54:45.149 --> 54:48.519
Got burnt up in fire.
Wore a mask to hide it.

54:48.553 --> 54:50.821
Lived inside the walls
of the house for 30 years.

54:50.855 --> 54:52.323
Never came out.

54:52.357 --> 54:53.524
The Heelshires?

54:54.158 --> 54:55.560
Yeah, the Heelshires.

54:57.161 --> 54:58.128
And?

54:59.630 --> 55:02.099
And the parents
committed suicide.

55:02.132 --> 55:03.167
Drowned themselves.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.869
It's a very sad story.

55:05.736 --> 55:07.538
[Liza] And the son?

55:07.572 --> 55:11.141
[Joe] Well, it all
got a bit messy after
the parents had gone.

55:11.175 --> 55:14.379
He killed a man,
very nearly two others,

55:14.412 --> 55:16.514
before he was killed himself.

55:17.915 --> 55:19.717
But they're all dead
and buried now.

55:22.487 --> 55:24.054
What's the son's name?

55:25.923 --> 55:28.058
[exhales]
His name was Brahms.

55:29.660 --> 55:31.529
[Sean]
Did you say Brahms?

55:31.562 --> 55:33.398
[Joe] I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to
keep it from you.

55:33.431 --> 55:36.066
I just didn't think
it'd ever come up.

55:36.767 --> 55:38.669
Thank you for telling us.

55:41.739 --> 55:43.273
[Liza] Come on, Jude.
It's time to go home.

55:48.379 --> 55:49.380
Hey, Joseph?

55:50.581 --> 55:51.882
[Sean]
Did you ever find your dog?

55:52.950 --> 55:54.251
Yes, I did.

55:54.284 --> 55:56.554
I'm afraid Oz was found
gutted in the forest.

56:01.025 --> 56:02.259
I'm sorry to hear that.

56:07.231 --> 56:09.734
So, your parents tell me
you've been talking again.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.839
Is this your new friend
Brahms?

56:14.872 --> 56:17.141
He seems like
a very nice friend.

56:18.943 --> 56:21.211
What are some of the things
you talk about?

56:21.245 --> 56:25.015
He... tells me
all sorts of things.

56:25.049 --> 56:28.453
Sometimes he tells me
about the other families
he's lived with.

56:28.486 --> 56:31.088
Oh. Has he lived
with a lot of families?

56:32.557 --> 56:35.359
He wants to live
with us now.

56:35.392 --> 56:38.529
He was very angry
that Mommy and Daddy
wanted to take him away.

56:38.563 --> 56:39.730
Oh.

56:39.764 --> 56:41.231
And when Brahms gets angry,

56:41.265 --> 56:44.902
does he say he wants to
hurt someone or something?

56:48.506 --> 56:52.109
Is there something he wants
to tell your mum and dad?

56:56.180 --> 56:59.216
Well, if Jude had something
to do with the dog's death,

56:59.249 --> 57:02.453
then this is a lot more
serious than we thought.

57:02.487 --> 57:05.122
The doll might be enabling him
to shift blame

57:05.155 --> 57:07.291
for all the bad things
that he might do.

57:07.324 --> 57:11.729
I think it would be
a good idea for me
to see him face-to-face.

57:11.762 --> 57:14.164
When do you think you can
bring him down to London?

57:14.198 --> 57:16.934
We've got guests coming today,
but we'll bring him
as soon as we can.

57:16.967 --> 57:18.803
All right, then.

57:18.836 --> 57:21.438
But I urge you,
keep a close eye on him
in the meanwhile.

57:44.328 --> 57:47.632
[no audible dialogue]

57:51.536 --> 57:53.437
[Sean] Jude! Everyone's here.

57:53.470 --> 57:55.439
-Anything goes.
Make yourself at home.
-[Mary] Thank you.

57:55.472 --> 57:58.142
This is just fabulous!
I love it.

57:58.175 --> 57:59.677
Hello.

58:03.413 --> 58:05.850
[Liam]
Well, look. There he is.

58:05.883 --> 58:08.719
You remember
your old Uncle Liam,
don't you?

58:08.753 --> 58:10.821
Hey.
[Will] What?
It's not my fault he's mental.

58:10.855 --> 58:12.056
[Mary] Shh, shh, shh.

58:13.323 --> 58:17.461
And...
who's this handsome chap?

58:17.494 --> 58:19.630
Brahms.

58:19.664 --> 58:22.466
Well. Hello there, Brahms.
Pleased to meet you.

58:22.499 --> 58:25.035
Any friend of Jude's
is a friend of mine.

58:26.937 --> 58:28.906
[Mary] Okay, children,
why don't we go outside
and play

58:28.939 --> 58:30.808
while we all have a catch-up.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.009
[Liam] Yes.

58:32.042 --> 58:34.078
[Will]
There's nothing to do outside.

58:34.111 --> 58:35.713
There's nature. All right?

58:35.746 --> 58:38.382
It's like a video game,
but real. Go, enjoy.

58:38.415 --> 58:39.917
[Sean] Come on, Jude.
Show them around.

58:42.687 --> 58:45.189
-Maybe I should go with them.
-Nonsense. They'll be fine.

58:45.222 --> 58:46.857
Just stay close
to the house, guys.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.561
This is so cool.
Shut up.

58:54.799 --> 58:56.000
I like your doll.

58:56.033 --> 58:56.934
Thanks.

59:00.537 --> 59:04.008
This place sucks.
There's nothing to do here.

59:04.041 --> 59:05.509
We could play croquet.

59:05.542 --> 59:07.077
I wanna play.
Come on.

59:07.111 --> 59:08.979
Don't touch him, Sophie.
He's mental.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.049
No, I'm not.

59:12.082 --> 59:15.385
My parents say
you talk to that doll,
like it's a real person.

59:15.419 --> 59:18.522
Because you went crazy
when your mum got attacked.

59:18.555 --> 59:20.725
And we're not supposed
to notice.

59:20.758 --> 59:21.926
Will!

59:21.959 --> 59:25.295
But they know you're mental.

59:25.329 --> 59:28.132
And I know you're mental.

59:28.165 --> 59:30.134
And your stupid doll,

59:30.167 --> 59:31.468
he's the most mental of all.

59:40.477 --> 59:42.146
He's fine, Liza.

59:43.681 --> 59:45.015
Have some wine.

59:47.618 --> 59:50.220
It'll do him good to hang out
with some other children.

59:50.254 --> 59:51.188
Yeah.

59:54.091 --> 59:55.159
I'm sorry.

59:58.696 --> 1:00:00.430
Ever since it happened,
I just...

1:00:02.633 --> 1:00:05.402
I can't seem to relax.

1:00:05.435 --> 1:00:07.304
Hey, you're with family now.

1:00:07.337 --> 1:00:09.139
You don't have anything
to worry about.

1:00:10.975 --> 1:00:12.509
And Will won't let
anything happen.

1:00:15.512 --> 1:00:16.781
Hey, you're breaking it!

1:00:16.814 --> 1:00:19.817
-Shut up, nutter.
-Stop it, Will!

1:00:19.850 --> 1:00:22.720
Oh, you're sticking up
for your nutter boyfriend now.

1:00:26.791 --> 1:00:29.259
Maybe I should
just smash your doll.

1:00:29.293 --> 1:00:31.929
Maybe that will
make you normal again.
Don't.

1:00:31.962 --> 1:00:33.998
[Mary chuckles]
We get to this party,

1:00:34.031 --> 1:00:35.866
and we have literally
just walked in the door,

1:00:35.900 --> 1:00:39.136
and his pants split
right in the bum.

1:00:39.169 --> 1:00:42.139
And not just a little tear,
the whole bum!

1:00:42.172 --> 1:00:43.708
I'm going to tell Mum!

1:00:43.741 --> 1:00:45.175
She'll probably be happy.

1:00:46.076 --> 1:00:47.644
Don't touch him.

1:00:47.678 --> 1:00:49.313
Or what?

1:00:49.346 --> 1:00:52.216
Or he'll make you wish
you never came here.

1:00:53.350 --> 1:00:54.685
Did you buy him purple boxers?

1:00:54.719 --> 1:00:56.520
[Mary] I did. [laughing]

1:00:56.553 --> 1:00:57.788
Kinky.

1:00:57.822 --> 1:01:00.524
It's good to see
that smile again, Liza.

1:01:00.557 --> 1:01:01.591
That old smile of yours.

1:01:04.361 --> 1:01:06.630
Give it back!
Nah, I don't think I will.

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:08.198
Give it back to her.

1:01:08.232 --> 1:01:11.001
Ooh, now your boyfriend's mad.

1:01:11.035 --> 1:01:13.003
Why don't you come get it
from me, mental?

1:01:13.037 --> 1:01:15.539
[Mary] I wouldn't worry
about this doll thing.

1:01:15.572 --> 1:01:17.742
Will used to be obsessed
with this blanket.

1:01:17.775 --> 1:01:19.076
Run, mental, run.

1:01:19.109 --> 1:01:20.344
Stop it, Will!

1:01:21.211 --> 1:01:23.247
[Mary] Obsessed.

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:27.651
Then one day I realized
that it was quite literally
a security blanket.

1:01:27.684 --> 1:01:29.720
I think this doll
could be the same thing.

1:01:29.754 --> 1:01:31.355
Come on, mental.

1:01:31.388 --> 1:01:33.824
You shouldn't worry about it,
is what I'm saying.

1:01:33.858 --> 1:01:36.160
Kids do all sorts
of weird things.

1:01:36.193 --> 1:01:38.162
They go through phases.

1:01:38.195 --> 1:01:39.563
And then poof, it's gone.

1:01:39.596 --> 1:01:41.866
[both grunting]

1:02:02.052 --> 1:02:04.488
[screaming]

1:02:08.325 --> 1:02:09.960
[Sophie screaming]

1:02:09.994 --> 1:02:12.729
-Oh, my God.
-What? What's going on?

1:02:13.263 --> 1:02:14.464
[Sophie] Will!

1:02:18.268 --> 1:02:19.636
Easy, on three.
One, two, three.
[Will crying]

1:02:19.669 --> 1:02:20.805
[Mary] Mind his head!

1:02:20.838 --> 1:02:22.439
Slowly. Slowly.

1:02:22.472 --> 1:02:24.241
[Liam] Mary, help
with his head, okay?

1:02:25.810 --> 1:02:27.945
[Mary]
Will, I'm coming in.
[crying continues]

1:02:27.978 --> 1:02:29.413
Sophie, get in the front.

1:02:57.674 --> 1:02:59.844
Sweetheart, why don't you
drink some of this?

1:02:59.877 --> 1:03:01.145
It'll help you sleep.

1:03:01.178 --> 1:03:02.779
A nap will do you good.

1:03:08.452 --> 1:03:09.353
Okay?

1:03:15.325 --> 1:03:16.193
There you go.

1:03:20.697 --> 1:03:21.731
Mommy.

1:03:29.173 --> 1:03:30.975
Everything's okay.

1:03:35.479 --> 1:03:37.381
He won't let me go.

1:03:37.414 --> 1:03:41.051
He wants me to live
in the big house
with him forever.

1:03:41.085 --> 1:03:44.922
He said
he'd kill you and Daddy
if I didn't do it.

1:03:47.024 --> 1:03:48.025
He said that?

1:03:52.897 --> 1:03:54.164
When did he say that?

1:03:56.100 --> 1:03:58.002
He says it all the time.

1:03:59.336 --> 1:04:01.705
I can't control him
anymore.

1:04:01.738 --> 1:04:03.773
He keeps getting stronger.

1:04:05.342 --> 1:04:06.810
Well,

1:04:06.843 --> 1:04:08.745
no one's gonna hurt
Mommy and Daddy.

1:04:10.247 --> 1:04:11.448
And no one's gonna hurt you.

1:04:12.549 --> 1:04:13.517
Okay?

1:04:50.487 --> 1:04:52.122
[beeping]

1:05:08.672 --> 1:05:09.773
[line beeps]

1:05:09.806 --> 1:05:11.241
Hey, Liza, it's me.

1:05:11.275 --> 1:05:13.978
We just saw the doctor.
I think Will's gonna be okay.

1:05:14.011 --> 1:05:16.146
So, I'll call you
from the car.

1:05:16.180 --> 1:05:17.347
All right.
I love you. Bye.

1:05:49.513 --> 1:05:51.481
[man] Not from around here,
are you?

1:05:51.515 --> 1:05:52.983
I'm staying
at the Glennview Estates.

1:05:53.017 --> 1:05:54.351
Glennview?

1:05:55.452 --> 1:05:58.588
Oh, you mean
the Heelshire place.
[laughing]

1:05:58.622 --> 1:06:01.225
Christ, you couldn't pay me
money to stop there.

1:06:02.292 --> 1:06:03.860
You what?
You don't know?

1:06:05.862 --> 1:06:08.798
Whole family went
completely mad out there.

1:06:08.832 --> 1:06:12.136
Something to do
with a son living
inside the walls for years.

1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:27.217
You see, but that's
not the only thing
that happened out there.

1:06:27.251 --> 1:06:30.954
There were other
tragedies before.

1:06:30.987 --> 1:06:36.393
Back in the '50s, a kid killed
his own mother and brother,

1:06:36.426 --> 1:06:38.695
convinced a doll
was speaking to him.

1:06:46.503 --> 1:06:48.305
And it's still going on.

1:06:48.338 --> 1:06:52.976
Last year,
that city man that bought it
after the Heelshires

1:06:53.009 --> 1:06:55.412
went a bit mad
and disappeared.

1:06:55.445 --> 1:06:57.414
Never heard from again.

1:06:57.447 --> 1:06:59.849
I saw him down the pub
one time.

1:06:59.883 --> 1:07:01.985
Old crazy Joe.

1:07:02.018 --> 1:07:03.320
Crazy Joe?

1:07:03.353 --> 1:07:04.988
That's what people
called him, mind.

1:07:05.021 --> 1:07:05.955
His name were Joseph--

1:07:43.593 --> 1:07:45.395
Oh, my God. Jude!

1:07:45.429 --> 1:07:46.396
Jude!

1:07:46.930 --> 1:07:47.831
Jude!

1:07:51.435 --> 1:07:52.302
Jude!

1:07:56.840 --> 1:07:58.475
Didn't have to be like this.

1:08:02.279 --> 1:08:03.180
[Liza] Joseph.

1:08:04.648 --> 1:08:05.849
Is Jude okay?

1:08:07.517 --> 1:08:09.619
Don't worry. He's safe.

1:08:11.955 --> 1:08:14.524
Safer now than he's probably
ever been in his life.

1:08:15.325 --> 1:08:16.260
Why are you here?

1:08:18.128 --> 1:08:20.297
I'm here because
he wants me to be.

1:08:21.298 --> 1:08:22.166
Who?

1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:24.468
Brahms.

1:08:27.537 --> 1:08:31.007
He doesn't like it like this,
but you've done it
to yourself.

1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:32.442
I just wanna know
where my son is.

1:08:32.476 --> 1:08:34.278
I will do anything you want.
Just give me my son.

1:08:34.311 --> 1:08:36.180
I want you to listen!

1:08:36.213 --> 1:08:38.615
He wants you to listen!

1:08:40.784 --> 1:08:43.119
You asked me why I'm here.

1:08:43.987 --> 1:08:45.655
It's the same reason
that you are.

1:08:46.723 --> 1:08:48.458
He called me.

1:08:48.492 --> 1:08:50.627
He calls out to the ones
that need him.

1:08:51.895 --> 1:08:53.463
The damaged ones.

1:08:53.497 --> 1:08:55.365
He looks inside you.

1:08:57.201 --> 1:08:58.302
It was just a whisper...

1:08:59.636 --> 1:09:00.970
at first,

1:09:02.038 --> 1:09:03.640
when I first came here.

1:09:04.241 --> 1:09:05.342
So quiet.

1:09:06.843 --> 1:09:09.012
And he was in pieces
when I found him,

1:09:09.045 --> 1:09:10.414
broken.

1:09:12.582 --> 1:09:13.917
And then the voice said...

1:09:14.651 --> 1:09:16.152
to put him back together.

1:09:18.755 --> 1:09:20.056
So I did.

1:09:25.929 --> 1:09:28.398
Then I heard him,
growing inside.

1:09:28.432 --> 1:09:29.266
You must've heard it.

1:09:31.601 --> 1:09:33.903
Jude sure has. Oh, yeah.

1:09:34.604 --> 1:09:36.706
I don't know what Brahms is,

1:09:36.740 --> 1:09:39.209
but you can stop this.

1:09:39.909 --> 1:09:41.545
It's too late.

1:09:41.578 --> 1:09:45.315
Brahms and Jude
are gonna be one,
and it'll be beautiful.

1:09:45.349 --> 1:09:47.517
Everybody thought
that I was crazy.

1:09:49.118 --> 1:09:50.854
They thought
the Heelshires were crazy,
but, oh, no.

1:09:52.289 --> 1:09:54.123
It's always been the doll.

1:09:58.027 --> 1:10:00.930
Even before the house,
before the Davies,
the ones before that.

1:10:00.964 --> 1:10:02.198
I found all their old letters.

1:10:02.232 --> 1:10:05.535
He knew that you were coming.

1:10:07.136 --> 1:10:09.939
He knew your boy
would find him.

1:10:11.475 --> 1:10:13.843
That's why he told me
to bury him.

1:10:13.877 --> 1:10:16.246
They're always so curious,
aren't they?
The little ones are like...

1:10:18.214 --> 1:10:19.583
like moths to a flame.

1:10:19.616 --> 1:10:22.252
Joseph, where is my son?

1:10:22.819 --> 1:10:24.688
I wanna see my son!

1:10:24.721 --> 1:10:27.457
He's in the big house!
[screaming]

1:10:39.436 --> 1:10:40.404
Jude!

1:10:45.141 --> 1:10:46.109
Jude!

1:10:49.613 --> 1:10:50.580
Jude!

1:11:12.469 --> 1:11:13.703
Jude.

1:11:15.939 --> 1:11:17.741
Jude?

1:11:17.774 --> 1:11:19.275
[voice whispering]
Over here.

1:11:22.512 --> 1:11:25.682
[voices whispering]

1:11:37.994 --> 1:11:39.629
[woman's voice]
This way.

1:11:44.701 --> 1:11:47.203
[hinges squeaking]

1:11:58.415 --> 1:11:59.583
We're just over here.

1:12:05.722 --> 1:12:07.424
[metallic thud]

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:28.378
[flames roaring]

1:12:36.252 --> 1:12:37.253
Jude...

1:12:48.031 --> 1:12:50.133
I know you don't
wanna hurt anybody.

1:12:52.536 --> 1:12:54.237
This isn't you, Jude.

1:12:57.807 --> 1:12:59.876
Please, put him down.

1:13:01.878 --> 1:13:03.480
It's going to be okay.

1:13:06.483 --> 1:13:07.717
Can I hold Brahms?

1:13:25.001 --> 1:13:27.103
I used to hold you
just like this.

1:13:32.175 --> 1:13:33.743
Let's just put him down.

1:13:45.655 --> 1:13:46.956
Hello, Mommy.

1:13:50.694 --> 1:13:52.862
Jude, put the gun down.

1:13:55.031 --> 1:13:56.533
We're very angry.

1:13:57.967 --> 1:13:59.836
You and Daddy
have been getting in the way.

1:14:02.371 --> 1:14:04.474
We're going to
live here now...

1:14:06.209 --> 1:14:07.544
because you can't protect us.

1:14:09.312 --> 1:14:10.647
Protect you from who?

1:14:11.548 --> 1:14:12.482
That dog.

1:14:14.183 --> 1:14:15.018
Will.

1:14:16.853 --> 1:14:19.288
-And those men
from that night.
-[screams]

1:14:21.324 --> 1:14:22.391
You're right.

1:14:23.993 --> 1:14:26.563
We do need Brahms
to protect us.
It's too late.

1:14:27.296 --> 1:14:29.232
You've given us no choice.

1:14:30.033 --> 1:14:31.835
Goodbye, Mommy.

1:14:31.868 --> 1:14:36.372
I know Brahms
is telling you what to say.

1:14:38.675 --> 1:14:41.978
Which is why we need to
take him home with us.

1:14:42.011 --> 1:14:44.514
Brahms needs to be
a member of our family.

1:14:46.349 --> 1:14:49.052
And what kind of a family
doesn't need a mother?

1:15:04.868 --> 1:15:07.136
[gasping]

1:15:07.170 --> 1:15:08.337
Mom?

1:15:16.512 --> 1:15:17.547
[Liza] Jude.

1:15:20.083 --> 1:15:20.950
[Joe] What have you done?

1:15:23.252 --> 1:15:24.220
What have you done?

1:15:25.388 --> 1:15:26.289
Stay back.

1:15:28.625 --> 1:15:31.761
It's me he'll punish.
I'm the one who didn't
protect him.

1:15:31.795 --> 1:15:32.996
[Liza] No, no.

1:15:33.029 --> 1:15:35.031
Joseph, Brahms can't
hurt you anymore.

1:15:36.299 --> 1:15:37.400
You don't understand.

1:15:38.034 --> 1:15:39.535
It will never be over.

1:15:53.082 --> 1:15:54.951
[notes playing]

1:16:18.608 --> 1:16:20.176
[Joe screams]

1:17:04.721 --> 1:17:06.522
[Jude] It's gonna be
all right, Brahms.

1:17:54.037 --> 1:17:56.072
[door opens]

1:17:58.007 --> 1:17:59.575
[chuckling]
Mom! You're home.

1:17:59.608 --> 1:18:01.244
Yes. I missed you.

1:18:01.277 --> 1:18:02.979
I missed you too.
Really?

1:18:03.012 --> 1:18:04.848
Perfect timing.
Hey.

1:18:04.881 --> 1:18:06.215
Hey, beautiful.
How was your day?

1:18:06.249 --> 1:18:07.851
It was good.

1:18:07.884 --> 1:18:10.720
I think we might
sign that author
I was telling you about.

1:18:10.754 --> 1:18:12.355
Yeah? Nice!

1:18:12.388 --> 1:18:13.589
All righty.

1:18:13.622 --> 1:18:15.524
This looks so good.
Thank you.

1:18:15.558 --> 1:18:17.761
Wait until you taste it,
because I'm pretty confident

1:18:17.794 --> 1:18:21.697
that this might be
the greatest coq au vin
ever made upon English shores.

1:18:21.731 --> 1:18:23.432
I'm not even joking.

1:18:23.466 --> 1:18:25.534
There's a whole
bottle of wine in here,
so I'm not sure if...

1:18:25.568 --> 1:18:27.170
No, okay.
I will give you some.

1:18:27.203 --> 1:18:28.938
Thank you.
All right.

1:18:28.972 --> 1:18:30.239
This looks so good.

1:18:30.273 --> 1:18:31.674
Thank you.

1:18:31.707 --> 1:18:33.877
Just two or three hours
of my day. Nothing much.

1:18:33.910 --> 1:18:35.444
[Sean chatters]

1:18:35.478 --> 1:18:36.913
[Liza]
Is it my turn tomorrow?

1:18:36.946 --> 1:18:38.481
[Sean] Yeah. Cheers.

1:18:39.749 --> 1:18:41.384
Good night, my man.
You sleep tight.

1:18:43.219 --> 1:18:44.788
[Liza]
I love you, sweetie.

1:18:44.821 --> 1:18:46.055
Love you too.

1:18:50.559 --> 1:18:51.460
Good night.

1:18:57.767 --> 1:18:59.402
[sighs]

1:19:48.952 --> 1:19:50.219
[whispering]
Good night, Brahms.

1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:53.622
I think we'll be happy here.

1:19:55.191 --> 1:19:56.893
If they learn the rules.
