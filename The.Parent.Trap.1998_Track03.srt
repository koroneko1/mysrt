00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,960
Resemblance?
Between you and me?

Now the other way.

156

Well, your eyes are much
closer together than mine.

157

Your ears...
well, don't worry,
you'll grow into them.

Your teeth

Oh, and that nose.
Well, don't worry, dear.
Those things can be fixed.

She and my dad split up

really beautiful.
- How do you know that?

299
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,690
Well, because my dad hadthis old picture

300

of her hidden in his
sock drawer.

301
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,100
He caught me looking at it,
like, all the time
so he gave it to me to keep.

302
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,700
Look, I'm really thirsty.

303
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,970
Sure you don't want to go
to the mess hall

304
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,810

or something?

happening?

306
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,750
I mean, think about it.

307
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,680
I only have a mother
and you only have a father.

308
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,650
You've never seen your mum
and I've never seen my dad.

309
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,090
You have one old picture
of your mum

310
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,030
and I have one old picture
of my dad.

311
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,700
But at least yours
is probably a whole picture,

312
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,000
mine's a pathetic little thing
all crinkled

313
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and ripped right down the
middle and...

314
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,700
What are you
rummaging in your trunk for?

315
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,310
This. It's the picture of
my mom.

316
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,880
And it's ripped too.

317
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,010
- Right down the middle?
- Right down the middle.

318
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,130
This is so freaky.

319
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,100
OK.

320
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,140
On the count of three,
we'll show them to each
other, OK?

321
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,310
OK.

322
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,780
One.

323
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,650
Two.

324
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,220
<i>(together)</i> Three.

325
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,990

326
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,660

331
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,010

332
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,050
and we were both born
on October 11,

333
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,820
then you and I are,
like, sisters.

334
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,260
Sisters? Hallie, we're,
like, twins.

335
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,940
I just don't know what to say.

336
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:27,370
- What's that you're holding?
- My locket. I got it when
I was born.

337
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,240
It has an <i>H</i> on it.

338
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,950
I got mine when I was born too
except mine has an <i>A</i> on it.

339
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,250
Now I've got goose bumps.

340
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,120
My God, so I'm not an only
child, I'm a twin.

341
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,430
I'm a twin. There's two of me,
I mean, two of us.

342
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,130
- This is, like...
- Mind-boggling.

343
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,870
- Totally.
- Completely.

344
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,900
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

345
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,780
<i>(Hallie)</i> Tell me, what's
Mom like?

346
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,140
Well, she designs
wedding gowns.

347
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,120
Really?

348
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,890
She's becoming quite famous,
actually.

349
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,690
A princess in Greece
just bought one of her gowns.

350
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,060
Wow.

351
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,790
You know what's interesting?

352
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,130
Neither one of our parents
ever got married again.

353
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,770
Has Dad ever been close
to getting remarried?

354
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,770
Never. He always says
I'm the only girl in his life.

355
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,370
Yeah. Mum's never come
close either.

356
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,720
I have a brilliant, beyond brilliant, idea.

357
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,490
I'm serious, I am a total
genius.

358
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,220
- You want to know what Dad
is like, right?
- Right.

359
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,390
And I'm dying to know Mom,
so what I'm thinking is...
Don't freak out, OK?

360
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,370
I think we shouldswitch places.

361
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,470
When camp's over,
I'll go back to London as you

362
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,470
- and you go back to
California as me.
- What?

363
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,340
Annie, we can pull it off.
We're twins, aren't we?

364
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,510
Hallie, we're totally and
completely,
100 percent different.

365
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,180
So? What's the problem?
I'll teach you

366
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,320
to be me and you
teach me to be you.

367

to know the difference
between us?

369

370

Come on, Annie.
I gotta meet my ma.

371
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,400
The truth is, you know,
if we switch,

372
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,840
sooner or later they'll have
to unswitch us.

373
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,410
And when they do they'll have
to meet again, face-to-face.

374
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,910
After all these years.

375
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,540
Thank you. I told you
I'm brilliant.

376

<i>(Annie)</i> OK. This is
Grandfather.

377
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,790
He's so cute. What do
we call him?

378
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,120
- Grandfather.
- Why didn't I think of that?

379
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,190
This is Martin. He's

380

- Mm-hm.

OK. Living room's first,
then over here is the

00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,310
Grandfather?

461
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,850
I'm home.- Is that my little girl?

462
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,320
That tall gangly thing?

463
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,860
- Yes. It's me.
- Oh.

464
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,530
Welcome home.

465
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:26,630
- Did you have a good time,
sweet pea?
- Uh-huh. Great.

466
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,500
What are you doing?

467
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,540
- Just smelling.
- Smelling?

468
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,670
- I'm making a memory.
- Oh.

469
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,040
Years from now, when
I'm all grown-up,

470
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,410
I'll always remember
my grandfather

471
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,880
and how he always
smelt of... peppermint and
pipe tobacco.

472
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,980
- Good to have you back.
- <i>(woman)</i> Annie?

473
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,060
Annie?

474
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,430
- Mother.
- You're back!

475
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:17,750
I can't believe it's you. - And I can't believe
it's you.

476
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,650
And with short hair.
Who cut it for you?

477
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,720
A girl I met at camp.
Do you hate it?

478
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,530
No, I absolutely love it.

479
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,490
You got your ears pierced?

480
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,030
Well, are there any other
surprises?
Bellybutton rings? Tattoos?

481
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,970
Oh, darling, what is it?

482
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,940
I'm sorry. It's just
I've missed
you so much.

483
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,780
I know. It seems like it's been forever.

484
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,420
You have no idea.

485
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,060
So, come on, tell me. Did you like everyone?
Was it fun?

486
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,600
Ah, Martin.

487
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,600
I found a stowaway
in your suitcase.

488
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,970
- <i>(whispers)</i> Oh, my God,
Cuppy.
- Cuppy?

489
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:13,540
He belongs to my friend.
The one I was telling
you about.

490
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,170
I can't imagine
how he got into my suitcase.

491
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,680
Well, since he's not
our Cuppy, shall we dispose
of the little creature?

492
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,510
No!

493
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,750
I mean, no.
I'll mail him to her.

494
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,520
She loves this thing a lot.
A lot, a lot.

495
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,720
She's, like, slept with
this thing
her entire life

496
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,990
and she could never be, like,
say, in a foreign country
without him.

497
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:37,900
No, no. I'll take care of it.
That will be all, Martin.
Thank you.

498
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,700

502

Annie just got home from camp.

503
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,490

OK. Hold on a moment.

508
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:28,980
Annie, would you hate
very much running down
to the studio with me?

509
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,250
No, I'd love it.

Wow.

519
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,790
That's incredible.
You designed that?

520
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,530
I had to do something
while you were at camp.

521
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,730
- You don't think it's too...?
- No, it's gorgeous.
I love it.

522
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,270
You know who would look
really beautiful

523
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,140
in that gown? I mean, like,
really beautiful.

524
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,610
- Who?
- You.

525
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:32,280
Me? You know what,
I think that time change
has made you a little loopy.

526
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,780
Come on.
Let's see what all the
fuss is about.

527
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,580
- OK. I'm here.
- <i>(man)</i>Ah, we're saved.

528
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,120
- Hi, Vendela.
- Hi.

529
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,120
Sorry, we don't know
what to do with the veil.

530
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,060
If she wears it
it covers the back of
the dress

531
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,290
and if she doesn't,
the dress looks...

532
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:49,760
Incomplete. You're right.
Can you try turning
sideways with your chin up?

533
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah. I see the problem.
Can I have the veil?
Annie, darling?

534
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,330
Pass me one of those hats
on display in the window.

535
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,770
- <i>(whispers)</i>Me?
- <i>(Elizabeth)</i> Yes.

536
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,710
- Which one do you like?
- The white one.

537
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,110
Me too.

538
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:14,050
Try this. Now throw the
veil straight back.

539
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,960
That's it. Now spin around,
I want to see the back
of the dress.

540
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,760
That's beautiful.
Did you get that? Just how it
falls just down there.

541
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,060
Don't worry about the bouquet.

542
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,860
You're married now,
you've got to learn to juggle.

543
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,930
Don't forget to look happy.
It is your wedding day.

544
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,100
My mom is too cool.

<i>( "Never Let You Go" by

So, doesn't designing
all these wedding gowns

550
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,700
ever make you think
about getting married again,

551
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,100
or at least make you think
about the F-word?

552
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,270
- The F-word?
- My father.

553
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,710
Oh, that F-word. Well, no,
actually,

554
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:12,710
because I didn't even wear a
wedding gown when
I married the F-word.

555
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,880
You didn't? Why not?

556
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,920
Why the sudden curiosity
about your dad, huh?

557
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,020
Well, maybe because
he's never mentioned,

558
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,050
and you can't blame a
kid for wondering.

559
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,920
Mother, you can't avoid
the subject for ever.

560
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,060
At least tell me
what he was like.

561
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,390
OK. He was quite lovely,
to tell you the truth.

562
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,030
When we met
he was actually
entirely lovely.

563
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,900
- All right?
- All right.

564
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,900
So did you meet him
here in London?

565
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,370
We met on the <i>QE2.
</i> - QE what?

566
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,240
The <i>Queen Elizabeth 2.
</i> It's an ocean liner

567
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,810
that sails from London
to New York.

568
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:46,380
'Cause I wasn't keen
on flying then
and neither was your father.

569
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,050
We met our first night
on board ship.

570
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,920
We were seated next to each
other at dinner.

571
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,080
- He's an American, you know.
- No kidding?

572
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,390
So, was it love at
first sight?

573
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,430
I knew you were going
to ask me all these
questions one day. Taxi!

574
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:06,730
<i>(Hallie) Dear old Dad.
I wonder what he's
doing at this very moment.</i>

575
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,410
Thanks.

576
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,420
Oh, gosh. It's him.

577
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,490
Hey, Hal!

578
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:31,190
Welcome home, kiddo.

579
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,800
- Get into these arms,
you little punk.
- Dad.

580
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,330
Finally.

581
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:50,140
Oh, I hope you had a lousy time at that
camp because

582
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,740
you are not going back.
I missed you too much.

583
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,810
What happened to you, Hal?

584
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,450
Something's changed.

585
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:00,850
Are you getting taller?

586
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,350
So, what's up, Dad?

587
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,960
I mean, how's Chessy
and everybody?

588
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,530
Great. Everybody's great.
Can't wait to see you.

589
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:14,330
Eight weeks really is
too long, Hal. A lot's been
happening around here.

590
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,940
A lot's happened to me
too, Dad.

591
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,870
I mean, I feel like
I'm practically a new woman.

592
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:24,310
What's the matter?
I cut myself shaving?

593
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:28,550
No, it's just...
just seeing you
for the first time.

594
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:32,220
I mean, you know...
in so long.

595
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,950
You look taller to me too,
Dad.

596
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,090
Come on, squirt.
Let's get home.

597
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,570
<i>(Dad)</i>Oh, by the way,
thanks for all those
newsy letters.

598

I'm really glad I bought you
all that personalized
stationery

599
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,280
you just had to have.

600

Dad, but we just...
- "We?"

601
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,480
Oh, me and my friend.
I met this girl at camp
and we got really close.

602
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,550
Great.

603
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:10,420
Practically like sisters.

604
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,490
- She was a lovely girl.
- "Lovely girl?"

605
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:17,160
What, all of a sudden you're
so proper?

606
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,530
- Still biting those nails,
I see.
- Dad, you noticed!

607
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:24,200
What do you mean, "noticed?"
You've been biting
them since you could chew.

608
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,270
But I've decided to stop, Dad.
It's a horrid habit.

609
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,570
"Lovely girl," "horrid habit."

610
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,980
What did I do, send you
to summer camp or
finishing school?

611
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,450
And why do you keep
saying "Dad"
at the end of every sentence?

612
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:38,080
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was doing it, Dad.

613
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,520
Sorry, Dad.

614
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,490
Do you want to know
why I keep saying "Dad?"
The truth?

615
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:49,060
'Cause you missed
your old man so much, right?

616
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,160
Exactly.

617
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,600
It's because in my whole life

618
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,070
I mean, you know,
for the past eight weeks -

619
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:02,270
I was never able to say the
word "Dad."
Never. Not once.

620
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:07,150
And if you ask me, a dad
is an irreplaceable person
in a girl's life.

621
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,250
Think about it. There's a
whole day
devoted to celebrating fathers

622
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,090
Just imagine someone's life
without a father.

623
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,050
Never buying a Father's
Day card.

624
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,220
Never sitting on their
father's lap.

625
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,190
Never being able to say,
"Hi, Dad!"

626
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:23,290
or, "What's up, Dad?"
or, "Catch you later, Dad."

627
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,330
I mean, a baby's first words
are always "Dada,
" aren't they?

628
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:30,570
Let me see if I get this.
You missed being able to
call me "Dad?"

629
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:34,070
Yeah. I really have, Dad.

630
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,680
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

631
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,520
Now you're starting
to sound like your old self.

632
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,570
<i>(dog barks)</i>

633
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,340
<i>(shrieks)</i> Hello, gorgeous!

634
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,580
Oh, look at you!

635
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,720
Oh, you grew.

636
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,150
Oh, we missed you so much.

637
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,490
Hey. Don't you dare
let your old man

638
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,420
talk you out of going back to
camp, OK?

639
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,230
You're a growing girl.
You need adventure.

640
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,360
OK.

641
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,430
You hungry? I made corn
bread and chili.

642
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,530
Why are you so quiet?
What's wrong?

643
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:37,400
Nothing. It's just I'm so
happy to be home.

644
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,970
Hey, did I hear
something about corn
bread and chili?

645
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:43,680
Yeah, it's on the stove. So...

646
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,680
Something's changed
about you, Hal. Hm.
I can't put my finger on it,

647
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,550
but something about you
has definitely changed.

648
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:55,190
Really? Well, it's just the
same old me.

649
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,550
- Honest.
- <i>(dog barks)</i>

650
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,660
Hi, Sammy!

651
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,630
What is wrong with you,
you goofball?
It's Hallie.

652
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:12,000
Oh, I probably just
smell like camp, that's all.

653
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,210
What's the matter with you?
It's like you didn't even
recognize her.

654
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:25,450
Wow, it's even better than
the pictures.

655
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:29,350
OK, kiddo.
What do you want to do
first, huh?

656
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:29,720
You want to eat and then
unpack, or we could
unpack and then eat.

657
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,330
Or we could eat while weunpack.

658
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,200
You mean I can eat in my room?

659
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,500
Yeah, it's a definite
possibility.

660
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,770
Hey, Hal. When you're done,
come on

661
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,470
down. There's someone I want
you to meet.

662
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:48,510
- OK, Dad.
- OK, Hal.

663
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:53,080
Look at you, always eating.

664
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,820
Did you tell her? - No.

665
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,750
Oh, Nicky.

666
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:04,820
Tell me what?

667
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,390
Hal, it is none of my business
how your

668
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,760
father makes a fool out of
himself, OK?

669
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,500
- He's a big boy. He can do
what he wants.
- OK, OK. So, who is she?

670
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:20,610
Her name's Meredith Blake. She's a publicist from San
Francisco.

671
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,170
Your father hired her
at the beginning of the summer

672
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,640
to do some publicity for
the vineyard.

673
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,850
If you ask me, she's doing a
better job of selling
herself than the grapes.

674
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:33,620
- What do you mean?
- <i>(Nick and Meredith laugh)</i>

675
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:37,090
Look, you and I both know
your father's not some
kind of suave, debonair,

676
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,290
bachelor-of-the-month type.

677
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,730
So I gotta ask myself,
what does a hot young thing
like that

678
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:44,460
see in a guy who walks around
with his shirttail hanging out

679
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,400
and a cereal bowl full
of chili.

680
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:47,730
Then I realized there's about
a million reasons why that
girl's giggling.

681
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:56,640
All of them are sitting at the Napa Valley
Community Bank.

682
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,140
You mean, you don't think
she even really likes him?

683
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,580
Ah, what do I know?

684
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,280
But I tell you one thing,
this one's got your

685
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,380
father eating out of the
palm of her hand.

686
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,190
They do everything together.
They ride together, they
swim together.

687
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,620
They go out to eat
dinner every night.

688
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:15,490
Do you know what?
Meet her. See for yourself.
Don't let me influence you.

689
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:16,290
There's my girl. Honey,
I want you to meet a
friend of mine.

690
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,640
Hal, this is Meredith Blake.

691
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,140
Hi.

692
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,180
Hi... Meredith Blake.

693
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:38,380
Wow, I can't believe
I'm finally meeting the
famous Hallie.

694
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,920
- I have looked forward
to this all summer.
- Really? Well, here I am.

695
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,820
Oh, Nicky, she's adorable.

696
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,490
You know, the way your
father talked about you,

697
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,560
I expected to meet
a little girl,

698
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,630
but you are so grown-up.

699
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,260
I'll be 12 soon.
How old are you?

700
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:55,230
26.

701
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:00,300
Only 15 years older than me.
How old are you again, Dad?

702
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,540
Wow, suddenly you're so
interested in math.
Look, I'm gonna go inside.

703
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,180
I'm going to get some
more chili, maybe a bottle
of champagne to celebrate.

704
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,850
What are we celebrating?

705
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:12,480
- Your homecoming, of course.
- <i>(phone beeps)</i>

706
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,350
Be right back.

707
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:18,660
Meredith Blake.

708
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,430
Hello, Reverend Mosby.

709
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:23,260
Mm-hm.

710
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,600
Of course. No, I understand
it's for a local charity?

711
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,230
Oh, yes, I am writing
it all down.

712
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,440
OK, it sounds very worthwhile,
I agree,

713
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:37,580
but unfortunately I see
that Mr. Parker will be out
of the country on those days.

714
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,850
Yes, absolutely.
I will be sure to mention
it to him.

715
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,680
Thank you.

716
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,680
So...

717
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,220
How was camp, Hal?
Was it fabulous?

718
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,460
- My dad's going out of
the country?
- Oh. No.

719
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,730
I just had to tell a little
white lie
to get him out of something.

720
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:58,260
You know, I have never heard
a man talk about his daughter

721
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,670
the way that Nicky talks
about you.

722
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,330
You two are obviously
incredibly close.

723
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,540
Well, you know, we're
closer than close.
We're all each other has.

724
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,670
<i>(shrieks)</i>

725
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,510
Sorry. Did I get you wet, Mer?

726
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,580
Just a little, Hal.

727
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:20,720
Hey, guess what.

728
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,390
Your daddy took me riding
the other day
and he let me ride your horse.

729
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,660
I hope that's OK with you.

730
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,430
Oh, sure.
Sprout's used to strange
women riding her.

731
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,970
Not that you're strange
or anything.

732
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:40,570
Actually, compared to
the others
you're relatively normal.

733
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:43,440
Others? What others?

734
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,840
- You want the 411?
- What's the 411?

735
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,880
The information,
the lowdown on other women.

736
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,420
Can't say I blame you.

737
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,920
I'd want to know if I was
number 28 -
I mean, 29 - in a man's life.

738
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,890
- I'm number 29?
- Yeah.

739
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:01,960
It's always the same routine.
Horseback riding through
the vineyards,

740
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,900
romantic dinners with his
special reserve
label wine. Moonlight swims.

741
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,470
Here we go.
A bottle of my special
reserve label.

742
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:11,640
So, did you girls find
something to talk
about while I was gone?

743
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,610
Does that mean yes? - It sure does.

744
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,650
<i>(phone rings)</i>

745
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:24,750
<i>(Elizabeth)</i>Will somebody
grab that, please?

746
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,380
- James residence. Annie?
- Yes, Martin?

747
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:32,460
Oh, dear, it sounds just
like you
on the phone.

748
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,330
I'm sorry. To whom did you
wish to speak?
Annie?

749
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:39,560
Of course. One moment, please.

750
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:43,770
A Mildred Plotka for you.
Sounds just like your twin.

751
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:47,000
My twin? Very funny.
Good one, Martin.

752
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:51,410
Hello? Oh, Mildred, darling.
Hi, how are you?

753
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:57,010
Hey. How's it going
over there?

754
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,550
<i>Oh, everything's quite
lovely here. We're
expecting a bit of rain today,</i> but, Mildred, can you hold on
for a moment?

755
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:02,620
OK, but hurry, Hal.
I've got to talk to you.

756
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,930
OK. Now I can talk.
Oh, my God, Mom's incredible.

757
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,900
I cannot believe I lived
my entire life
without knowing her.

758
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,430
She's beautiful and
fun and smart

759
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,370
<i>and I love the gowns
she designs.
</i> - But...

760
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:20,040
And I got her talking
about how she and
Dad first met

761
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,470
- and if you ask me there's
a whole...
- <i>Hallie!</i>

762
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,910
Stop! We've got a
major problem.

763
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,680
You're going to have
to bring Mother out here
immediately.

764
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,550
Immediately? Are you nuts?
I've only had one day
with her.

765
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:32,880
I'm just getting to know her
I can't. I won't.

766
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,390
But this is an emergency.
Dad's in love.

767
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:40,690
Get out of here.
Dad doesn't fall in love.
I mean, at least not seriously

768
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,930
Trust me, he's serious
about this one.

769
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,000
He's always holding her hand
and kissing

770
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,630
her neck and waiting on her
hand and foot.

771
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:50,130
- He is?
- It's disgusting.

772
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,440
You'll just have to break
them up. Sabotage it.
Do whatever you have to.

773
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,170
I'm trying, but, I mean,
I'm at a slight disadvantage.

774
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:59,480
<i>I only met the man
12 hours ago.</i>

775
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,810
<i>Hal, you've got to
get back here
to help me.</i>

776
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,720
Annie, I can't. I want more
time with Mom.

777
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,880
<i>(rustling)</i>

778
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,650
What's going on?

779
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,620
Annie, are you still there?
I can barely hear you.

780
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,420
- I'm here, what are you...?
- <i>Operator, operator.</i>

781
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,760
- I think I lost you, Annie.
- <i>Hello?</i>

782
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,460
Thanks for all the help, Hal.

783
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,800
Ahem.

784
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:25,800
Hi. I had a phone call
from a friend at camp.

785
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,140
Yeah, it's an old
camp tradition, talk to your
friend from inside a closet.

786
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,610
Kind of stupid, I know, but...

787
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:33,740
So, breakfast, anyone?

788
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,990
OK. Here we go.
Most important meal
of the day.

789
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:45,520
Eggs, sunnyside up.
Bacon, side of toast.

790
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,830
And in case you're really
hungry, a stack of humongous
chocolate chip pancakes,

791
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,500
which smell incredible,
if I do say so myself.

792
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,070
Thanks, Chessy.

793
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,570
You're not hungry again?

794
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:59,000
You hardly touched your chili,
your favorite food in the
world,

795
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,210
and now you don't want your
breakfast?
Are you sick, honey?

796
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:04,810
I'm fine, I promise.
Where's Dad?

797
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:08,180
Oh, he and Miss
I'll-just-have-half-a
grapefruit- thank-you

798
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:12,780
left about an hour ago.
You overslept
and he didn't want to wake you

799
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,850
Of course I'd probably
oversleep too

800
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:19,190
if I were up until midnight
making mysterious
phone calls from my bathroom.

801
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:22,530
Oh. Oh, that? I was calling
a friend from camp. Mildred.

802
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:27,130
- She lives in New York.
- Oh, I see.

803
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:29,730
So you wanted to wait and
call Mildred at a time
that was convenient for her

804
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,740
because of the time
difference?

805
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,670
Exactly. Because of the
time difference.

806
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:37,910
Uh-huh? So you waited
until it was three in the
morning her time?

807
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:40,010
That makes perfect sense.

808
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:40,180
Actually... it was seven at
night her time.
You see, she lives in New York

809
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,880
but she was on vacation with her family in Bora Bora.

810
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:50,890
Mm-hm.

811
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:56,260
Very smooth.

812
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,700
OK, look, smarty-pants,
your father wants you
to meet him at his office

813
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,060
as soon as you're done
with breakfast.

814
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,600
He does? Thanks.

815
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,540
I'm done.

816
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,770
<i>(Sammy barks)
</i> - Whoa!

817
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:08,970
That dog has gotten so weird.

818
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,140
Bye, Chessy. Thanks again
for breakfast.
It was great.

819
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:19,280
Push, Hal.

820
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,950
Sorry. I... forgot.

821
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,830
Honey, I'm really glad you're here.

822
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:34,930
'Cause there's something
really important
I want to talk to you about.

823
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:38,570
That's funny because there's
something really important
I want to talk to you about.

824
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:41,140
- Yeah? Well, you go first.
- No, you.

825
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:46,010
OK. I want to talk to you
about Meredith.

826
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:51,150
And I want to talk to you
about my mother.
What about Meredith?

827
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:54,350
- Well, what about your
mother?
- Dad, I'm almost 12.

828
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:56,320
How long do you expect me
to buy that story

829
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,360
that the stork dropped me
on your doorstep?

830
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,730
Oh, come on, Hal.
We've talked about your
mother.

831
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,890
No, we haven't. Not really.

832
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,600
A girl needs more in life
than half a crumpled old
photograph.

833
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:12,170
Dad, I'm almost a teenager.
Face it, I need a mother.

834
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:15,610
You know what. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

835
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:16,740
You do need a mother,
which brings me to...

836
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:21,010
Meredith? - Hi.

837
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:25,880
- Hello, Hal.
- Hi.

838
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,850
Hallie, this is my assistant
Richard.

839
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:29,190
Richard, this is Nick's
daughter.

840
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:31,060
Theone I've been telling
you so much about.

841
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,020
- Oh, hello. How are you?
- Hi, there.

842
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,730
- Did you tell her?
- Almost.

843
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:40,060
Hey, if you're free later,
why don't we all
have lunch on the terrace?

844
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,870
Well, actually, I promised Hal
we'd hang out together
this afternoon.

845
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:46,940
Oh, no problem.
I've got plenty to do.

846
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,340
I'm working on a new label
design, Nicky, featuring y-o-u
You're going to love it.

847
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:57,080
- See you for dinner, darling. Bye, Hal.
- Bye.

848
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,650
First change I make
is to send that two-faced
little brat

849
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:01,920
off to boarding school in
Timbuktu.

850
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,220
- Ooh. Ice woman.
- Proud of it, babe.

851
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:16,230
Come on, Dad.

852
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:24,440
OK, OK. You win. Hold up.
Give that horse a rest.

853
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,450
<i>(Hallie)</i> Whoa, Sprout.

854
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,120
So, honey,
you excited about our
camping trip?

855
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,380
What camping trip?

856
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,450
What camping trip? The one
we take every summer
before you go back to school.

857
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,820
Oh, that camping trip.

858
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:42,160
Yeah, sure. I can't wait.

859
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,160
So, Hal...

860
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,700
- What do you think of
Meredith?
- As what, Dad?

861
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:53,100
Your publicist? Your friend?

862
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:57,040
No, just what do you
think of her,
as a person?

863
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:57,240
Well, she's cute.
She has nice hair, good teeth.

864
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,080
She can spell the word "you."

865
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,250
Honestly, Dad?
The woman's a complete
stranger to me.

866
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,320
Why do you want my opinion
anyway?

867
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,360
I'll tell you why, Hal.
Because, believe it or not...

868
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,790
Race you back to the ranch,
Dad!

869
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,890
Hal!

870
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,030
Hal, I'm trying to tell you
something.

871
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:23,170
Hey! Slow down.

872
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:51,430
I'm in so over my head here. I can't handle this,
I just can't.

873
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:53,860
I'm only one kid. <i>(gasps)</i>

874
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,800
You got something you want
to share with the class
there, Hal?

875
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,370
Chessy, you gave me a fright.

876
01:02:58,370 --> 01:02:59,500
I gave you a fright?

877
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:07,010
You scared me.
I didn't know you were,
like, in here.

878
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:11,980
Are you sure there
isn't anything
you want to talk to me about?

879
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,850
Like why Sammy
never comes near you anymore.

880
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:20,320
or why your appetite's
changed.

881
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:23,260
Or why all of a sudden you're
neat as a pin

882
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:27,800
and using expressions like,
"You gave me a fright."

883
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,430
Chessy, I changed a lot
over the summer, that's all.

884
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,400
OK.

885
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:36,370
Boy, if I didn't know
any better, I'd say
it's almost like you were...

886
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:43,110
Forget it. It's impossible.

887
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,950
Almost as if I were who,
Chessy?

888
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:48,520
Nobody. Nobody. Forget
I mentioned it.

889
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,160
Almost as if I were... Annie?

890
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,430
You know about Annie? - I am Annie.

891
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,940
<i>(Nick)</i> Hal.

892
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:10,010
Hal, why did you take off
on me like that?

893
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:12,940
I told you I wanted to
talk to you about something.

894
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:17,610
Chessy, why are youlooking at her like that?

895
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:24,190
Like what? I'm not looking
at her any special way.

896
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:27,520
I'm looking at her like I've
looked at her for 11 years.

897
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,160
Since the day she came home
from the hospital.

898
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,200
Six pounds, 11 ounces.
21 inches long.
This is how I look at her.

899
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,900
Can I hug her?

900
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,500
Oh, she's so beautiful.

901
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,110
And so big.

902
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:51,380
I'm going to make you
something special to eat.
What would you like? Anything?

903
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,920
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

904
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,350
I'm just gonna go whip up
everything we've got. OK?

905
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:58,660
Hal, come here.

906
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,360
- We have to talk.
- OK. Shoot.

907
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,300
OK.

908
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,170
Honey...

909
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:09,000
I want to know what you think
about making Meredith
part of the family.

910
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:17,980
Part of our family? - Yeah.

911
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,480
- I think
it's an awesome idea.
- Yeah?

912
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,050
- Inspired! Brilliant!
- You do? Really? You do?

913
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:24,310
Totally. I mean, like it's
a dream come true. I've always
wanted a big sister.

914
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:31,990
Oh.

915
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,390
Um... Honey, I think you're
kind of missing the point.

916
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:38,100
No, I'm not. You're going
to adopt Meredith.

917
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:38,500
- That is so sweet, Dad.
- No,
I am not going to adopt her.

918
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:46,340
I'm... going to marry her.

919
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,400
Marry her? That's insane.

920
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:52,580
How can you marry
a woman young enough
to be my big sister?

921
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:55,380
<i>Mais tu plaisantes, j'espère.
Meredith, ce n'est pas
une fille pour toi.</i>

922
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,250
<i>Mais c'est pas possible,
je rêve. Qu'est-ce qui...</i>

923
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,480
Calm down. Hal!

924
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:03,290
Are you speaking French?

925
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:06,260
I learned it at camp.

926
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,630
OK. I'm sorry.

927
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:12,560
Let's discuss this calmly.
Calmly and rationally.

928
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,130
Yeah, and in English,
if you don't mind. Right?

929
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:17,230
OK.

930
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,700
Sweetheart,
what has gotten into you?

931
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:23,340
Nothing. Nothing. Just...

932
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:23,540
Dad, you can't get married.
It'll totally ruin
completely everything.

933
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:30,450
Hal. Hal.

934
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:32,620
Hallie.

935
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,250
Don't look at me.
I don't know a thing.

936
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,990
<i>(music blasts from car stereo)</i>

937
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:51,740
She thoughtI was going to adopt her?

938
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,210
Hi, doll. - Hi.

939
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,680
Oh. You look stressed, baby.

940
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:04,550
How about a martini? - How about a double?

941
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:10,020
Coming right up.

942
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:10,790
Chessy!

943
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:18,430
Don't you love it?
It's just what we need,
it's such a big house. Chessy!

944
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:23,130
You rang? - Two martinis, please.

945
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:28,170
And make Mr. Parker's
a double.

946
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:29,640
Chess, please.
I'm getting a migraine.

947
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:40,450
- I told Hallie.
- You did? And?

948
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:42,350
She went ballistic.

949
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:46,060
She started yelling in French.
I didn't even know
she spoke French.

950
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,590
- I don't know what's gotten
into her.
- Oh, Nicky.

951
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:51,260
This reaction
is totally classic.

952
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:54,400
It's "Daddy's
Getting Remarried 101."

953
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,270
I'd be worried
if she didn't act this way.

954
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:59,100
Look.

955
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:02,510
Why don't I go talk to her?
You know, woman-to-woman.

956
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:07,240
I think she's a little
sensitive about you right now.

957
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:12,520
That's why I need to do it.
We've got to
break the ice sometime.

958
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:17,720
Wear your shirt like this.
I like it when
I can see a little chest hair.

959
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,470
Knock, knock. Can I join you?

960
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,710
Sure.

961
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:44,510
Guess the news of the
engagement came
as a bit of a shock, huh?

962
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,220
Basically.

963
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:49,650
You know, I remember
what it was like to be 11.

964
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:53,290
I had my first beau at 11.
It's a wonderful age.

965
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:57,230
You're just starting to feel
like a woman and,
believe it or not,

966
01:08:57,230 --> 01:09:00,700
soon you'll understand
what it's like to be in love.

967
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,830
Me? I don't think so.

968
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:05,540
I don't even have
my 12-year-old molars yet.

969
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:10,340
Well, take it from someone
who got their molars
very early in life,

970
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:15,150
being in love is a fantastic
mystery that takes a man
and a woman...

971
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:19,250
I don't mean to be jerky when
you're trying to be all mushy
and everything,

972
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:21,320
but I know what mystery
my dad sees in you.

973
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,250
You do?

974
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:27,290
You're young and beautiful and
sexy and, hey, the guy's
only human.

975
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,690
But if you ask me,

976
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:31,900
marriage is supposed to
be based on something more
than just sex, right?

977
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:36,570
Boy, your father
underestimates you.

978
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:40,570
But you won't.
Will you, Meredith?

979
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:43,640
Being young and beautiful's
not a crime, you know.

980
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,440
And for your 411,
I adore your father.

981
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:51,480
He's exactly the kind of man
I always planned on marrying.

982
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:55,790
This is the real deal, honey.
And nothing you do is going
to come between us.

983
01:09:55,790 --> 01:10:00,660
Hate to break it to you, angel
but you are no longer the only
girl in Nick Parker's life.

984
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:04,330
- Get over it.
- If this is the real deal,

985
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:08,930
then my dad's money has
nothing to do with you wanting
to marry him, right?

986
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:12,740
OK, puss. You listen
and you listen good.

987
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:16,240
I am marrying your father
in two weeks
whether you like it or not.

988
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,540
So I suggest you do not tangle
with me anymore.

989
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:19,980
You are in way over your head.
Is that clear?

990
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:23,980
Crystal.

991
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:36,490
<i>(Grandfather)</i>Martin!
A refill, please.

992
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,270
- Lovely choice of wine,by the way, Martin.
- Thank you, sir.

993
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:48,410
- May I have a sip?
- I don't think
you're going to like it.

994
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:03,890
Well, if you ask me,the bouquet's a little
too robust for a Merlot,

995
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:07,520
but then again I'm partial to
the softer California grape.

996
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,700
Has she learned about wine
at the summer camp?

997
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,630
She must have.

998
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:26,310
Darling! Are you all right? - I had one sip too many,
I guess.

999
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:29,850
You know, Mother,
I feel like I could use
a bit of fresh air.

1000
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:32,420
Would it be OK if I stepped
outside for a moment?

1001
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:34,420
Are you OK?
Would you like me
to go with you?

1002
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,990
No, no, no. I'll be fine. Just
got a touch woozy, that's all.

1003
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,290
Woozy, huh?

1004
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:04,680
I'd like to place a collect call to America,
please.

1005

01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:16,360
Hal, I'm desperate.
Dad's getting married.

What do you mean,
getting married?

- What?
- <i>The wedding's in two weeks.</i>

1011
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,570
If there's any hope of getting
Mum and Dad back together
we've got to do it fast.

1012
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:29,640
And I mean really fast.

OK. So Mom and I are going out
to the theater tonight.

- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh. Yes.

1019

Now, what say you and I take
a little stroll in the park,
eh, young lady?

01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:54,900
OK.

Well, it's a long story.

Well, it's a very big park
and we've got plenty of time,
you know.

1025
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:07,510
Well, first of all...

have to finish this sketch
and fedex it off to Paris.

Then how about you
and I go out to lunch

and spend the rest of the day
getting lost in Harrods. Hm?

Annie felt the exact same way about Dad, so we sorta
just switched lives.

1050
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,880
I hope you're not mad, because I love you so much

1051
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:53,150
and I just hope that one day
you can love me as me,

1052
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:55,890
and not as Annie.

1053
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:58,890
Oh, darling.

1054
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:00,760
I've loved you
your whole life.

1055
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,890
<i>(sobbing)</i>

1056
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,530
I've never been so happy
in my entire life.

1057
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,610
<i>(wails)</i>

1058
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:17,810
So, I...

1059
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:24,550
I guess you have
to switch us back now, huh?

1060
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:25,010
Well, technically, you belong
to your dad and Annie
belongs to me.

1061
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:31,090
His and hers kids. No offense, Mom, but this arrangement
really sucks.

1062
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:38,700
I agree. It totally sucks.

1063
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:44,000
Then I say we fly to Napa,
see Annie and Dad, and work
this whole thing out.

1064
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,070
And I say you're right.
Not to worry, darling.
I'll take care of everything.

1065
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:50,640
You're not to worry, OK?

1066
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,750
I'm sorry.
I can't handle this.

1067
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,980
I mean, I haven't seen
or heard from Nick Parker
in over 11 years,

1068
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:04,090
and suddenly I'm flying
halfway across the world to...

1069
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:06,620
I'm not mature
enough for this.

1070
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:09,890
If the man didn't make me
so nuts, I'd still be married
to him.

1071
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:14,200
I mean, we came up with this
arrangement

1072
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,000
so that we'd never
have to see each other again. I mean, look at me, Martin.
Have you ever seen me
like this?

1073
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,200
- Well...
- Don't answer that.

1074
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,940
I mean, what if he doesn't
recognize me?

1075
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:24,570
No, don't answer that, either.

1076
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:28,650
So, Hallie said
he was a... a hunk.

1077
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:31,080
He was rather dishy.

1078
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,350
He had a smile that made me
go weak at the knees,
if you can imagine that.

1079
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:38,120
- OK. I'm all set, Mom.
- Great. Me too. Almost.

1080
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,190
Mom, your suitcase is,
like, totally empty.

1081
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:43,860
Oh. Right. Sorry. Um...

1082
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,800
Did you speak to your father,
dear?

1083
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,160
Um... Yeah, yeah.
I just hung up with him,
actually.

1084
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:51,030
He said he's really anxious
to see you.

1085
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,000
Anxious nervous,
like he's totally,
completely dreading it?

1086
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,140
Or anxious excited,
like he's looking forward
to it?

1087
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,180
- Anxious excited. Definitely.
- Oh.

1088
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:04,810
He said he'll meet us tomorrow
at noon at the Stafford Hotel
in San Francisco.

1089
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,980
My, my, my. That's incredibly
soon, isn't it?
Well. Um...

1090
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,390
Why don't you run downstairs
and gather up our tickets

1091
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:12,720
from your grandfather
while I finish up here?

1092
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:18,030
OK.

1093
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:22,230
- <i>(whispers)</i> Liar, liar,
pants on fire.
- Sh! Oh, Martin, I have a really
ridiculous, somewhat childish
request to make.

1094
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:24,800
Martin, you know that you're
more than a butler to me.

1095
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,340
You're more like a lovable
brother who just happens
to wait on us and...

1096
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:28,770
Anyway, I was wondering if...

1097
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:30,010
I'd accompany you on the trip?

1098
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:31,340
Make it a bit easier for you?

1099
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:34,140
Would you, Martin?
Thank you so much.

1100
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:37,380
I'd be so grateful. And you
don't even have to come as our
butler, just as a friend.

1101
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:41,080
Madam, I'd be honored.
And may I say, as a friend,

1102
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,720
if I was seeing my ex,
after 11 years,
and I had your legs...

1103
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,090
I'd wear this little baby.

1104
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:51,090
You'll kill in it.

1105
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:01,300
Bye, Daddy, darling. - Bye, darling.

1106
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,740
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

1107
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,410
- Bye, Pop.
- Bye, Hal.

1108
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:11,380
So you're coming to Napa
for Thanksgiving, right?

1109
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:13,920
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

1110
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,150
Bye.

1111
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:20,690
Oh, and say hello
to your father for me.

1112
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:22,730
I will.

1113
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:33,470
Airport, please.

1114

OK. They'll be here any minute.

1116
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:58,130
Now, be nice, Daddy.

1117

He's everything you ever
wanted for your little girl,
plus millions more.

Then you know I'll be nice.

01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:05,370
Oh, OK. There he is.

01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,180
Hi, darling.

1123
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,250
Hallie. Chessy. And Sammy.
What in the world
are you doing here?

1124
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:24,920
Honey, a dog at the Stafford?

1125
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,120
- Hal begged me to bring him.
- Oh, you're such a softy.

<i>(Sammy growls)

Good doggy. So, Meredith,
these the folks?

1128
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:36,170
Yes. Mom, Dad,
you finally meet.

1129
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:40,140
This is my fiancé and the love
of my life, Nicholas Parker.

1130
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:43,370
Hello, Nicholas.
I'm so pleased to meet you.

1131
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:45,340
- I'm Vicki.
- Hi.

1132
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:48,380
And this is Nick's adorable
daughter Hallie.

1133
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:51,380
This entire prenuptial
get-together was her idea,
I'll have you know.

1134
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:55,390
How are you, young lady?
We've heard nothing but
wonderful things about you.

1135
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:59,390
Hello, pet.
You may call me Aunt Vicki.

1136
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,940
Other end, madam. - Whoops.

1137
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:23,580
That was a great flight,wasn't it? I mean,
it was so quick.

1138
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:26,420
I've never seen you quite
so thirsty before, madam.

1139
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:30,390
Well, would you believe,
Martin, darling, I've never
tasted vodka before this trip?

1140
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:32,420
Could have fooled me, ma'am.

1141
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,060
<i>(Elizabeth)</i> Come on.
Let's rock and roll.

1142
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:38,430
I am in such major
trouble here.

1143
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:41,460
If the hotel can do it,
I think that room is perfect
for the wedding.

1144
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:43,530
Not too big, not too cramped.

1145
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:45,900
And not that I don't like
the idea of having the wedding
at the house,

1146
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:49,970
it's just that this
could be amazing.

1147
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:53,010
So I've already checked us in.
Why don't we go upstairs,
freshen up,

1148
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:55,110
and then rendezvous for lunch?

1149
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:57,310
- Great.
- Meet you in the bar in ten.
OK?

1150
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:00,220
Perf.

1151
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:04,150
Sweetheart, now that we're
here, why don't we go check
out the honeymoon suite?

1152
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:07,220
I bet it is to die for.

<i>( "In the Mood")</i>

1154
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,570
Oh, whoops.
I forgot my bag.

1155
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:18,570
Hang on.

1156
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:21,170
Sammy.

1157
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:21,340
Sammy!

1158
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:26,280
Sammy! - Excuse me.
Did you find a beige...

1159
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:31,380
Thank you.

1160
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:33,880
- Ooh.
- Mum!

1161
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:37,120
Darling, you didn't have
to wait for me. I could have
found the room by myself.

1162
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,160
Besides, I need to get
a little fresh air.

1163
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:44,230
Go on, sweetie.
I'll meet you upthairs.

1164
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:46,000
I like that jacket,
by the way.

1165
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,360
Were you wearing that
the whole time we were
on the plane?

- Mum, watch out!
- <i>(bellboy)</i>Sorry, sorry.

had more than one glass
of wine in her entire life,

1168
01:21:57,110 --> 01:22:00,080
and she chooses today
to show up totally zonked.

1169
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,940
Yeah, well. Just do what the
woman says and meet
her "upthairs."

1170
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:06,980
Maybe that's why they make "do not disturb" signs.

1171
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:14,390
Alone at last.

1172
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:31,040
Hallie Parker.

1173
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,940
Oh, don't do this to me.
I'm already seeing double.

1174
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:35,040
- It's me, Mum. Annie.
- Oh, darling.

Oh, my girls.

1177

I can't believe you're
together. But how could you
do this to me?

<i>(clears throat)</i>

1179

Excuse me.
I hate to interrupt, but...

1180
01:22:55,670 --> 01:23:00,700
might I suggest that
we continue this little
powwow inside?

1181
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:01,470
- Hi. You probably
don't remember me.
- Chessy.

1182
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,040
I knew I always liked her.

1183
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:12,050
One of you... I'm not sure
which one at the moment,

1184
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:15,690
but one of you told me
your father knew I was
arriving here today.

1185
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:18,690
And I'm here to tell you
that the man I just saw
in the elevator

1186
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:21,760
had absolutely no idea
he and I were
on the same planet,

1187
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,490
- let alone in the same hotel.
- You saw Dad already?

1188
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,330
Yes, I did.
The man went completely ashen,

Ghost of Christmas Past.

cold for my head?

pondered what it was going
to be like

to see your father
after all these years?

Well, let me tell you, me
waving like a mindless idiot

1194
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,680
while Nick Parker's wrapped
around another woman's arms

1195
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:48,650
is not exactly the scenario
I had in mind. No, sirree.

01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:53,120
Martin! What are you doing?

1198
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,490
Going for a dip, madam.
Do you mind?

1199
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:58,630
No, no. No, that's perfectly
perfect.

1200
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:01,500
Have fun.
Someone ought to.

1201
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:02,770
Hello.

1202
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:05,670
Hello. Hello to you.

<i>(Elizabeth)</i> Chessy,
this is our butler, Martin.

How do you do?
I'm her butler.

1205
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:14,240
<i>Enchanté, mademoiselle.</i>

1206
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,240
Gee. The pleasure's all mine,
monsieur.

1207
01:24:17,610 --> 01:24:20,120
Girls, you were going to tell me why you lied

1208
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:25,050
and brought me here
without telling your father.

1209
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,660
Were they?
OK, that's good. Uh...

1210
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:30,630
Well, I'm just gonna go back
to my room and check out the
old mini-bar situation.

1211
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:33,800
- Allow me to assist you.
- <i>(Elizabeth)</i> Wait.

1212
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:37,070
Does everyone here
know something I don't know?

1213
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:38,370
Mum, Daddy's getting married.

1214
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:44,540
To Cruella De Vil. She's awful, Mum. We can't let
him go through with it.

1215
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:53,450
She's all wrong for him, Mom,
and the only way he won't
marry her is if...

1216
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:55,520
You tell her.
She knows you better.

1217
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,520
Is if he sees you again.

1218
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:04,730
Wait a minute. You're
not trying to set me up
with your father?

1219
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:07,830
<i>(Hallie)</i> Actually, we are.
You're perfect for each other.

1220
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:11,800
Hold it!
You two knew about this?

1221
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,500
- What? Oh! No.
- No.

1222
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:14,640
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Madam, no, absolutely.
I had no idea.

1223
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:20,780
Yes. Yes, I did know something.

1224
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:23,250
Yes. Technically, yes.
I had an inkling.

1225
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:25,250
- Hallie told me the story.
- It was their idea.
It was so sweet.

1226
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,550
I just fell for the story.
I'm an old romantic.

1227
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:28,220
Yeah, so am I.

1228
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:30,190
OK. OK.

1229
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:33,590
Let me say this
loud and clear.

1230
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:36,590
Nick Parker and
I have absolutely nothing
in common...

1231
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:38,630
anymore.

1232
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:41,500
Plus, in case you haven't
noticed, he seems
extremely content

1233
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:45,130
with his leggy, tight-skirted,
bare-backed fiancée.

1234
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,140
And I want the two of you
to explain to your father

1235
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:50,370
that I am here for one
purpose, and one purpose only.

1236
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:53,140
And that is
to switch the two of you back.

1237
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:55,680
Now, let's do what we have
to do and be done with it.

1238
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,750
Understood?

1239
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,750
- Hey, Dad. What's up?
- Hi. Just running down
to the lobby.

1240
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:02,690
- Hey, Hal.
- Huh?

1241
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,250
Do me a favor, will ya,
while I'm gone?

1242
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,320
Will you just look after
Meredith for me?
Huh? Thanks.

1243
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,820
- Hallie. Hallie.
- Yeah?

1244
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,660
How do I look?
Like, presentable
and everything?

1245
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:15,300
- Not too old?
- You look fab, Dad.
Young and fab.

1246
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:25,880
Dad.

1247
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,240
I thought you were gonna
keep Meredith company.

1248
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:30,750
I was? I mean, I am, yeah.

1249
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,780
I was just looking for her,
actually.

1250

It's great to see you, Dad.

- Nice outfit.
- Oh, thanks.

1253

Well, go on.
Get up there. Come on.

Let's get together, yeah,

Why don't you and I combine?

1256

Let's get together...

1257
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,870
- Have you seen your father?
- You talking to me?

1258

What, are you Robert De Niro?
Yes, I am talking to you.

1259
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:00,980
Oh, Meredith.

- Well, hello. Where was he?

Uh... He went thataway.
I think.

What are you staring at? - Oh, nothing. Nothing.

You're just really
very pretty.
That's all.

Oh...

1265
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:25,700
Don't tell me you're gonna
break your rotten streak and
suddenly be nice to me.

1266
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:27,700
If you see your father,
tell him he's late
and I'm waiting.

designed in <i>Vogue</i> and fell
completely in love with it.

1282
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:37,340
I faxed your office just
yesterday, and they said that
you were out of town

1283
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:38,740
and didn't know
if you could make another.

1284

on here that I should know
about?

to see you.

But, uh... you don't seem
as stunned to see me.

1307

heard from you

- Dad.

I can explain why she's here.

Hallie, you know who this is?

Actually, yes.
And, actually, I'm not Hallie.

Actually, I am.

1313

Both of them?

1314
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:51,970
Annie?

1315
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:56,750
Hallie?

1316
01:30:56,750 --> 01:31:00,480
I guess you and Mum kind
of think alike, 'cause you
both sent us to the same camp.

1317
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,750
We met there,
and the whole thing
just sort of spilled out.

1318
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:08,590
They switched places on us,
Nick.

1319
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:11,190
You mean I've had Annie
with me all this time?

1320
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:11,690
Well, I wanted to know what
you were like, and Hallie
wanted to know Mum, and...

1321
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:20,800
Are you angry? - Oh, honey. Of course not.

1322
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:21,100
I just can't believe it's you.

Oh, sorry - you're all wet.

- It's all right.
- Look at you.

1325
01:31:33,850 --> 01:31:38,220
Well, I'm quite grown-up now,
and quite without a father.

1326
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:41,190
And I'm headed into my crazy,
mixed-up teenage years,

1327
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:46,000
and I'll be the only girl
I know without a mother
to fight with.

1328
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,230
Hallie, you've been in London
all this time?

1329
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:52,230
Come here, squirt.

1330
01:31:56,170 --> 01:32:01,840

Dad. I don't know how you ever
let her go.

1331
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:06,020
Girls, why don't you let your
father and I talk alone for
a couple of minutes, OK?

1332
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:09,080
- Sure, fine.
- Take your time.

1333
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:10,220
I don't believe this.

1334
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:17,590
Seeing them together,
seeing you.

1335
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:20,130
- Ow.
- Ooh.
Let me help you with that.

01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,610
So... how are you, Lizzie?

1341
01:32:34,610 --> 01:32:37,050
Or does everyone
call you Elizabeth now?

1342
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:39,920
Oh, no, no. Lizzie's...
Lizzie's fine.

1343
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,320
- My dad still calls me
Lizzie.
- Yeah?

1344
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:46,820
- Yeah, I've been...
uh, been terrific.
- Oh.

1345
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:50,160
You know,
you haven't changed a bit.

1346
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:55,800
Finally. There you are.
Oh! Uh... Oh, good.
You've met.

1347
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,570
Honey, Elizabeth
designs wedding gowns,
and she's going to make my...

1348
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:03,770
Wait, um...
I don't understand.
How did you two meet?

1349
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:06,140
And, Nicky,
why are you all wet?

1350
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:08,210
You're making
my fiancée's wedding gown.

1351
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:10,750
- Well, I didn't know
she was your fiancée.
- Well...

1352
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:13,120
How did we meet?
How did you two meet?

1353
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:13,880
- Am I missing something here?
- Know what?
This is one small world.

1354
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:19,590
How small?

1355
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:21,620
- Hi, Mer.
- Hello.

1356
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:24,990
- How you doing?
- <i>(shrieks)</i>

1357
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:29,260
Honey, did I ever mention
to you that Hallie was a twin?

1358
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:32,630
No, I'm afraid you forgot
that little detail.

1359
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:36,070
Don't feel bad, Mer,
he never mentioned it to me,
either.

1360
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:39,740
By the way,
I'm the real Hallie.
This is Annie.

1361
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:43,310
She was pretending to be me,
while I was pretending
to be her.

1362
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:43,680
And this is our mother,
Elizabeth James.

1363
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,820
This is your mother?

1364
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:51,050
<i>(both)</i> Yes.

1365
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:53,360
You were married to him?

1366
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,360
- Yeah.
- Guilty again.

1367
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:59,900
- Oh, well.
This is a small world.
- And getting smaller.

1368
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:03,830
And what a coincidence that
we're all here on the exact
same weekend.

1369
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:07,740
My, my, my. How sweet.

1370
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,250
Hal, I've had enough surprises for one day.

1371
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:19,050
Will you please just tell me
where we're going?

1372
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:21,380
You're gonna love it, Dad.
Trust me.

1373
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:23,090
Hello.

1374
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,260
Hey.

1375
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:32,290
So...

1376
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:35,060
Do you have any idea
where they're taking us?

1377
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:40,200
- Not a clue.
- Right.

1378
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,320
Where are we?

1379
01:35:04,690 --> 01:35:06,360
This is where we're eating?

1380
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,930
No, actually,

1381
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:13,370
that's where we're eating.

1382
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:16,140
<i>(Annie)</i> She's ours for
the night.

1383
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:16,440
<i>(Nick)</i> Wow. So how exactly
are we paying for this?

1384
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,310
Well, we pooled our allowances.

1385
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:27,950
- Yeah, right, Annie.
- OK. Grandfather chipped
in a bit.

1386
01:35:27,950 --> 01:35:31,290
- Annie.
- OK. He chipped in a lot.

1387
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:33,320
<i>(Hallie)</i>Come on.
You guys are gonna love it.

1388
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,790
<i>(Nick)</i> Pretty snazzy.

1389
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:40,730
Elizabeth and Nick,
your dinner awaits you.

1390
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,140
Girls.

1391
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,250
The table's only set for two.

1392
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:01,920
Oh. That's the other part of
the surprise.
We're not joining you.

1393
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:06,320
You're not? - No, but I am.

1394
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:12,430
Good evening. I'm Chessy,
and I'll be your server
this evening.

1395
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:16,130
- No wisecracks, please.
- And I am Martin,
your sommelier.

1396
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:20,270
May I offer you both a taste
of the bubbly in the hope that
you'll get a bit schnockered

1397
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:23,770
and not fire this lovely lady
and myself

1398
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:27,510
for following
the orders of these
audacious 11-year-olds?

1399
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:29,950
Annie, mood music, please.

1400
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:38,190
<i>( "I Love You
for Sentimental Reasons"
by Linda Ronstadt)</i>

1401
01:36:38,190 --> 01:36:41,960
Just relax.
Sail through time.

1402
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:44,430
<i>(Hallie)</i> Back to yesteryear.

1403
01:36:50,330 --> 01:36:52,170
- You do get all this,don't you?
- Yes, I'm beginning to.

1404
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:57,370
They're recreating the night we met.
The boat, the music...

1405
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,280
The help.

1406
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,450
It's so sweet.

1407
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:05,810
Martin,
I think I'll take that drink.

1408
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,050
Thank you, Martin.

1409
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:13,390
Oh. Yeah.

1410
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:19,230
To tell you the truth,I haven't been on a boat
since the <i>QE2.</i>

1411
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,830
Neither have I.

1412
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,940
Well, then, here's to, uh...

1413
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:32,170
Our daughters.

1414
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,210
Our daughters.

1415
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:42,620
Now I know how a goldfish feels.

1416
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:45,620
<i>(groans)</i>

1417
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:48,290
You know, sometime
if we're ever really alone,

1418
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:49,360
maybe we could talk about
what happened between us.

1419
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:56,400
It all feels a bit hazy to me now.

1420
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:59,630
It ended so fast.

1421
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,200
It started so fast.

1422
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:05,340
Well, that part
I remember perfectly.

1423
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,410
Looks like things are
heating up
quite nicely.

1424
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:13,920
I'd say it's safe to serve
the vichyssoise.

1425
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,320
You ladle, I'll serve.

1426
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:19,420
I'm sorry.

1427
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:28,530
Yes, I'll ladle.

1428
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:29,630
Right. And then I'll...

1429
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:34,240
Serve?- Right.

1430
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:38,540
Right.

1431
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:43,650
<i>(Elizabeth)</i> So... you've done
fantastically well.

1432
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:48,220
Your dream of owning your own
vineyard, it actually
came true.

1433
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:52,090
What about you? You were
always drawing on napkins
and corners of newspapers.

1434
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:54,420
Now you're
this major designer.

1435
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:57,230
Yeah. It's great.

1436
01:38:57,230 --> 01:38:59,960
We both actually got
where we wanted to go.

1437
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:02,330
Yeah. We did.

1438
01:39:02,330 --> 01:39:04,370
Anyway, what are we going
to do about the girls?

1439
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,340
Well, now that they've met,
we can't very well
keep them apart.

1440
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:14,710
Well, I could keep them
for half the year, and then
you could keep them for...

1441
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:18,110
Guys, they can't go to
two different schools
every year. That's nuts.

1442
01:39:18,110 --> 01:39:19,650
I agree.

1443
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:21,580
Well, I could keep them both
for a whole year, and you...

1444
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:24,590
- Liz, that's why we came
up with...
- Mm-mm. Mm-hm.

1445
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:26,390
<i>(clears throat)</i>

1446
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:30,730
Oh. Sorry. Ignore me.
Enjoy your soup.

1447
01:39:30,730 --> 01:39:34,030
That's why we came up with
the solution that we have.

1448
01:39:34,030 --> 01:39:35,160
Really? I thought it was
because we decided never to
see each other again.

1449
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,700
Not "we," Liz.

1450
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:45,610
Well, you know, that part's
become a bit hazy to me too
over the years.

1451
01:39:45,610 --> 01:39:47,240
You don't remember the day
you packed?

1452
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:50,280
No, that day
I remember perfectly.

1453
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,980
Did I hurt you when I threw
that, um...
What was it? A...

1454
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:56,350
It was a hairdryer.

1455
01:39:56,350 --> 01:39:58,150
Oh. Right.

1456
01:39:58,150 --> 01:39:58,420
Sorry.

1457
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:03,190
You know, I may never
be alone with you again.

1458
01:40:07,630 --> 01:40:12,700
So, about that day that you
packed... Why'd you do it?

1459
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:13,470
Oh, Nick. We were so young
and we both had tempers.

1460
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:21,210
We said stupid things and so I packed.

1461
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:21,440
Got on my very first
747 and...

1462
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:25,750
You didn't come after me.

1463
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:31,150
I didn't know that
you wanted me to.

1464
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:33,760
Well, it really doesn't matter
anymore.

1465
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:38,160
So let's just put a good face
on for the girls and get this
show on the road, huh?

1466
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:47,570
Yeah. Sure. Let's get this show
on the road.

1467
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,250
Your passport, Ms. James.Have a safe trip home.

1468
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:59,350
Thank you.

1469
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:00,580
All set, then?
Where's Annie?

1470
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:03,180
I just rang up.
She's on her way down.

1471
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,720
Right.

1472
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,420
So I'll send Hallie
back to you over Christmas.

1473
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:12,330
And Annie'll spend Easter
with you.

1474
01:41:12,330 --> 01:41:13,630
<i>(elevator bell)</i>

1475
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:18,400
Annie, what are you doing in
those clothes? We've got
a plane to catch.

1476
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:23,340
Here's the deal, Mom.

1477
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:26,440
We thought it over,
and we decided we're being
totally gypped.

1478
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:30,380
Dad promised we'd go on our
camping trip, and we wanna go.
Together.

1479
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:32,210
What camping trip?

1480
01:41:32,210 --> 01:41:34,520
The one we go on
every summer
before school starts.

1481
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:37,190
Annie, this is ridiculous.
Go upstairs and
put your clothes on.

1482
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:40,490
- Are you sure I'm Annie?
- Well, of course I'm sure.

1483
01:41:40,490 --> 01:41:43,460
But it's kind of hard
to be 100 percent positive,
isn't it?

1484
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:48,130
Girls, this is totally
unfunny. You're gonna make
your mother miss her airplane.

1485
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:49,730
- Annie.
- <i>(both)</i> Yes?

1486

This one's Hallie. I'm positive.

01:42:00,210 --> 01:42:02,180
You know,
I hope you're right, Dad,

1488
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:02,340
because you wouldn't wanna
send the wrong kid all the way
back to England.

1489
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:08,250
Would you?

1490
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:18,530
Here's our proposition.

1491
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:20,800
We go back to Dad's house,
pack our stuff,

1492
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,370
and the four of us
leave on the camping trip.

1493
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:26,640
- The four of us?
- And when you bring us back,

1494
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,700
we'll tell you who's Annie
and who's Hallie.

1495
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:32,270
Or you do as we say,
and I take one of you back
with me to London,

1496
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:34,780
whether you like it or not.

1497
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:44,250
And what am I supposed to do for three days?
Sit home and knit?

1498
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:47,160
Honey, we have kind
of a sticky situation.

1499
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,190
Sticky situation? What do you
mean, sticky situation?
What exactly...?

1500
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:53,700
Excuse me. What is she doing here?

1501
01:42:56,430 --> 01:43:00,870
You see, that's part
of the deal. The four of us,
we go together.

1502
01:43:00,870 --> 01:43:02,700
What are you,
suddenly the Brady Bunch?
This is ridic...

1503
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:05,340
Hello. Everything all right?

1504
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:07,580
Well, no, actually, it isn't.

1505
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:10,910
I didn't realize that
you were going
on this little outing,

1506
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:13,620
and to tell you the truth
I'm not so sure that I'm OK
with it.

1507
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:15,750
I agree.

1508
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:18,890
I think the ex-wife
in the next sleeping bag
is a little weird.

1509
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:21,960
- Thank you.
- I absolutely insist
that you come with us.

1510
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:24,530
- Really.
- Liz...

1511
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:28,460
No, honestly, Nick, I've
messed up your entire weekend.
It's the least I can do.

1512
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,500
Really. Please.

1513
01:43:42,410 --> 01:43:45,950
- Dad, what's Meredith doing here?
- Your mother invited her.

1514
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:47,250
What?

1515
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:47,620
Be nice.

1516
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:05,230
OK. All set? Have fun, everyone.

1517
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:08,270
- What?
- Liz, what are you doing?

1518
01:44:08,270 --> 01:44:11,910
Well, I really think that you
and Meredith need some time
alone before the big day.

1519
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:14,640
Mom, come on.
That's not the plan.

1520
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,350
Oh, honestly, you'll have much
more fun without me.

1521
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:19,750
Wait, wait. If you're
not going, I certainly don't
have to go.

1522
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:22,350
I mean, trust me,
I'm not a big nature girl.

1523
01:44:22,350 --> 01:44:24,820
But this is your chance
to really get
to know the girls.

1524
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:29,260
I mean, after all, starting
next week they're...
they're half yours.

1525
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:37,330
Have fun, all of you.

1526
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:43,910
Bye-bye.

1527
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:44,370
Oh, I would pay big money
to see that woman
climb a mountain.

1528
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:49,540
- <i>(Nick)</i> Don't hurry, honey.
- <i>(Annie)</i>OK.

1529
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:58,020
Whoa!

1530
01:44:58,020 --> 01:44:59,890
Come on, you guys.

1531
01:44:59,890 --> 01:45:01,920
Whoa. Whoa.

1532
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:18,770
I'm gonna kill my trainer.

1533
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:21,940
He says
I'm in such great shape.

1534
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:25,480
I can't believe people
actually do this for fun.

1535
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:27,750
Hold on. We're stopping.

1536
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:33,350
Again? Dad, at this rate
it'll take us three days
just to get to the lake.

1537
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,820
<i>(Nick)</i> Meredith isn't used
to the altitude. Just chill.

01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:47,400
Somebody hand me my Evian.

1542
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,400
I can't move.

Sure.

Honey, you OK?

1547
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:19,470
- What happened?
- This little guy was
on her Evian bottle.

1548
01:46:19,470 --> 01:46:22,370
Oh. He won't hurt you, Mer.

1549

Oh, right, right, right.
I... I know.

go ahead.

I'll be fine.

1553

Get that thing away from me.
I hate things that crawl. Ugh.

How can you touch that?
Just... put it down.

1555

OK, OK, I'll put it down.

Sure you'll help me.
Right over a cliff,
you'll help me.

Not a bad idea. - Yeah. See any cliffs?

Oh, my backpack.

Not from you, thank you.

Don't think I can't see right
past those angelic faces.

One more trick from you two

<i>(Hallie)</i>Nothing, nothing.

This is really good. - Yeah, I know.

Here we go, girls.
This'll hold us for a while.

Sure you don't want
some trout, Mom?

1581
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:30,530
Is that OK, by the way,
if we start calling you Mom?

1582
01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:33,070
I think your mother would
prefer if you called me
Meredith.

1583
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:34,570
And no, thank you,
I do not eat trout,
for the thousandth time.

I will wait until breakfast. What are we having?

1585

- <i>(all)</i> Trout.
- Oh.

Come on, it's part
of the experience.

Mm, and what's the other part?

1588
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:52,250
Being eaten to death by
mosquitoes? God, you'd think
they actually like this stuff.

1589
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:54,760
Well, what's that
you're using?
Here, let me see that.

1590
01:48:56,660 --> 01:49:00,130
You're gonna attract every mosquito in the state
with this stuff.

1591
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,270
It's sugar and water.

1592
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:08,000
Where'd you get it?

1593
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,710
That's it. I am taking
one large sleeping pill

I don't want
the mountain lions to...

There are no mountain lions
up here, are there?

01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:33,060
No.

We've been punished

- Go.
- Where's Meredith?

1631
01:53:24,090 --> 01:53:27,960
We played a couple of harmless

Hm.

She threw this at my head.

Least it's smaller
than a hairdryer.

Oh, Nick, it's all my fault.
If I hadn't suggested
she go...

Oh, tricked.
Tricked would be more like it.

1638

Like mother, like daughters.

1639
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:50,250
I really am sorry.

1640
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:52,820
- We are too, Dad. Really.
- Yeah.

1641
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:55,160
Up to your room. Now.

1642
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:04,030
I gotta remember to thank them one day.

1643
01:54:08,270 --> 01:54:12,070
So, where's Chessy?
I'm starving.

1644
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:12,340
Well, she and Martin went off
on a picnic around noon...
yesterday.

1645
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:18,050
Really? Who would have thought?
My nanny, your butler. Hm.

1646
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:26,090
So, what do you say I whip us up something to eat?

1647
01:54:26,090 --> 01:54:29,890
- You can cook now?
- Oh, yeah. I can make pasta

1648
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:31,890
and pasta and...

1649
01:54:31,890 --> 01:54:34,030
Pasta sounds good.

1650
01:54:34,030 --> 01:54:36,300
Pasta it is.

1651
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:43,900
<i>(Annie)</i> OK, I'll take two.

1652
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:45,310
- Hey, Dad.
- Wow, you look so nice.

1653
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:51,650
Where are you going?

1654
01:54:51,650 --> 01:54:54,010
Good night, ladies.

1655
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:03,620
Oh, wow.

1656
01:55:03,630 --> 01:55:06,490
This is where
I keep my private stash.

1657
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:09,460
- Did you know
I also collect wine?
- Really?

1658
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:10,360
Mm. I'm a man of limited
interests. Come here.

1659
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:14,640
This is a 1921 Burgundy.

1660
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:23,180
They say the rain that year
made this the best Burgundy
ever harvested.

1661
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:25,280
Oh.

1662
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:28,450
Now, you will appreciate this.
Come here.

1663
01:55:37,390 --> 01:55:39,590
Look.

1664
01:55:39,590 --> 01:55:43,060
V-J Day 1945.

1665
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:45,630
- That's incredible.
- I love that.

1666
01:55:51,370 --> 01:55:54,440
Now, this is the same wine that was served
at my parents' wedding.

1667
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:56,710
Bordeaux, '52.

1668
01:55:56,710 --> 01:55:57,580
I think my sister
was conceived on this baby.

1669
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:02,520
What's this one? "Where dreams have no end."

1670
01:56:06,490 --> 01:56:09,390
1983.

1671
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:11,630
That one, actually,
took me years to track down.

1672
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:15,500
Why? Where's it from?

1673
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:16,500
It's the wine that we drank
at our wedding.

1674
01:56:19,130 --> 01:56:21,200
I now have every bottle ever made.

1675
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:25,440
You do?

1676
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:28,410
I do.

1677
01:56:33,580 --> 01:56:36,120
- Can we open one?
- You're the only one
I'd drink it with.

1678
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:40,450
You OK? - Oh, yeah.

1679
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:45,330
Just got a little dust
in my eye, that's all.

1680
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:46,990
I can offer you
a clean sleeve.

1681
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,330
No, no, I'm fine, really.

1682
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:51,370
All better.

1683
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:53,230
You don't always have
to be so brave, you know.

1684
01:56:56,140 --> 01:56:56,600
Oh, but I do, actually.

1685
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:03,540
<i>(car pulls up)</i>

1686
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,780
That will be Chessy.

1687
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:10,520
She has a key.

1688
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:22,400
<i>(door opens)</i>

1689
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:24,370
<i>(Chessy)</i> Hello? Anybody home?

1690
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,540
We'll be right up.

1691
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:58,130
<i>Oh</i>

1692
01:57:58,130 --> 01:57:58,370
<i>Every time</i>

1693
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,600
<i>We say goodbye</i>

1694
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:07,310
<i>I die a little</i>

1695
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:12,750
<i>Every time</i>

1696
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:16,520
<i>We say goodbye</i>

1697
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:22,660
<i>I wonder why a little</i>

1698
01:58:27,230 --> 01:58:28,330
<i>Why the gods above me</i>

1699
01:58:32,170 --> 01:58:32,700
<i>Who must be in the know</i>

1700
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:41,780
<i>Think so little of me...</i>

1701
01:58:46,150 --> 01:58:48,180
Take care of yourself.

1702
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:50,480
Yeah, I will. You too.

1703
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:54,460
Bye.

1704
01:59:04,730 --> 01:59:07,300
I love you.- I love you too.

1705
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:15,580
<i>I can hear</i>

1706
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:16,140
<i>A lark somewhere</i>

1707
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,750
<i>Begin to sing about it</i>

1708
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,420
<i>There's no love song finer</i>

1709
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:33,290
<i>But how strange the change</i>

1710
01:59:37,630 --> 01:59:38,430
<i>From major to minor</i>

1711
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:46,240
<i>Every time</i>

1712
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:52,450
<i>We say goodbye</i>

1713
02:00:06,190 --> 02:00:08,830
Hello? We're home.

1714
02:00:08,830 --> 02:00:10,900
Grandfather?

1715
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:13,300
I'll check the study.

1716
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:21,710
Hey, stranger.

1717
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:29,480
Hey, Mom. Did you know
that Concorde gets you here
in half the time?

1718
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:30,580
Yes, I've heard that.

1719
02:00:31,690 --> 02:00:34,860
What are you doing here?

1720
02:00:36,690 --> 02:00:40,230
It took us around 30 seconds
after you guys left

1721
02:00:40,230 --> 02:00:43,360
for us to realize we didn't
wanna lose you two again.

1722
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:44,900
We?

1723
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:52,440
We.

1724
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:56,380
I made the mistake of not
coming after you once, Lizzie.

1725
02:00:56,380 --> 02:01:01,480
I'm not gonna do that again,
no matter how brave you are.

1726
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:06,020
And I suppose you just expect
me to go weak at the knees
and fall into your arms

1727
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:08,920
and cry hysterically and say,
"We'll just figure
this whole thing out."

1728
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:11,290
A bicontinental relationship

1729
02:01:11,290 --> 02:01:15,900
with our daughters being
raised here and...
and there and...

1730
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:16,560
and you and I just picking up
where we left off and...

1731
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:20,970
and growing old togetherand...

1732
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:24,610
and....

1733
02:01:27,710 --> 02:01:31,040
Come on, Nick,
what do you expect?
To live happily ever after?

1734
02:01:31,050 --> 02:01:32,710
Yes.

1735
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:35,280
To all the above.

1736
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:38,950
Except you don't have
to cry hysterically.

1737
02:01:38,950 --> 02:01:41,360
Oh, yes, I do.

1738
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:22,400
We actually did it.

1739
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:25,930
<i>This will be
an everlasting love</i>

1740
02:02:25,930 --> 02:02:29,770
<i>This will be the one
I've waited for</i>

1741
02:02:29,770 --> 02:02:32,570
<i>This will be</i>

1742
02:02:32,570 --> 02:02:37,410
<i>The first time anyone
has loved me</i>

1743
02:02:37,410 --> 02:02:41,110
<i>I'm so glad you found me
in time</i>

1744
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:44,850
<i>And I'm so glad that
you rectified my mind</i>

1745
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:46,990
<i>This will be</i>

1746
02:02:46,990 --> 02:02:50,720
<i>An everlasting love for me,
yeah</i>

1747
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:52,630
<i>Whoa</i>

1748
02:02:52,630 --> 02:02:56,560
<i>Loving you
is some kind of wonderful</i>

1749
02:02:56,560 --> 02:03:00,500
<i>Because you've shown me
just how much you care</i>

1750
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:03,870
<i>You've given me
the thrill of a lifetime</i>

1751
02:03:03,870 --> 02:03:06,970
<i>And made me believe
you've got more thrills
to spare</i>

1752
02:03:06,980 --> 02:03:09,810
<i>Oh, this will be</i>

1753
02:03:09,810 --> 02:03:12,680
<i>An everlasting love</i>

1754
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:15,050
<i>Oh, yes, it will, now</i>

1755
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:23,120
<i>You've brought
a lot of sunshine into my life</i>

1756
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:26,930
<i>You've filled me
with happiness I never knew</i>

1757
02:03:26,930 --> 02:03:30,060
<i>You gave me more joy
than I ever dreamed of</i>

1758
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:34,400
<i>And no one, no one
can take the place of you</i>

1759
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,070
<i>This will be</i>

1760
02:03:36,070 --> 02:03:37,910
<i>You and me</i>

1761
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:39,940
<i>Yes, sirree</i>

1762
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:41,880
<i>Eternally</i>

1763
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:43,740
<i>Hugging and squeezing
and kissing and pleasing</i>

1764
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:45,810
<i>Together, forever,
through rain or whatever</i>

1765
02:03:45,810 --> 02:03:49,120
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
you and me</i>

1766
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:51,150
<i>So long as I'm living,
true love I'll be giving</i>

1767
02:03:51,150 --> 02:03:53,490
<i>To you I'll be serving
'cause you're so deserving</i>

1768
02:03:53,490 --> 02:03:56,160
<i>Hey, you're so deserving</i>

1769
02:03:56,160 --> 02:04:05,800
<i>From now on</i>
