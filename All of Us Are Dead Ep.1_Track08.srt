[Mr. Lee] <i>A virus…</i>

709
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:03,648
is somewhere between a living organism
and a non-living organism.

710
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:07,610
Like a living organism,
it adapts to its surroundings and evolves.

711
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,825
Everything that evolves in this manner

712
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,996
should be considered
an independent living organism.

713
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,417
Mr. Lee, the textbook says a virus is not
an independent living organism.

Whether or not it's categorized that way

doesn't depend on its metabolism,

[sobbing]

728

This parasite's
final destination is a bird.

729
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,629
The parasite enters a snail
and infects its ocular tentacles.

730
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,341
That makes the snail put itself
in the path of predatory birds.

731
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,721
So the infected snail commits suicide
at the whim of the parasite.

-[shudders]

Now, is that because the snail
is less intelligent?

735
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,901
It's not.

736
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,738
It's because
the parasite's will to survive

737
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,448
is much stronger than the snail's.

Let's go to the infirmary, okay?

811
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,948
-What kind of a psycho does this?
-Nam-ra.

812
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,324
[Sun-hwa] Make sure
they study on their own.

813
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,410
And please don't say anything to anyone
until I come back and confirm the facts.

814
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,121
Hyeon-ju. Can you get up?

815
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,039
I'll carry her.

816
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,457
[Sun-hwa] Okay.

817
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,584
-Can someone help him out, please.
-Here.

818
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,669
-[Sun-hwa] Good.
-Okay.

819
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,380
-[Sun-hwa] Go back to your seats!
-[Su-hyeok grunts]

820
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,464
Now.

821
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,133
[tense suspenseful music]

822
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,470
[all panting]

823
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,182
-Hyeon-ju.
-[I-sak] What's wrong?

824
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,517
[Sun-hwa] Guys, hold her still.

825
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,021
-[rapid footsteps]
-What's wrong with her?

826
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,856
[all panting]

827
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,485
[groans, breathing heavily]

828
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,320
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

829
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,739
What do I do?
[whimpering]

830
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,449
[nurse] Does your stomach hurt? Is it bad?

831
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,492
Let me see.

832
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,035
Please help.

833
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,870
-Huh?
-[nurse] Uh, wait, hold on.

834
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,871
Put her on the bed.

835
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,623
-Please take a look at her.
-Here, lookout.

836
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,252
[beeps]

837
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,797
Her temperature is way too low.

838
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,966
Here, hold it down
so she doesn't kick it off.

839
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,092
[growls]

840
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,510
[Su-hyeok] Hold her. Hold her.

841
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,220
-Hyeon-ju, Hyeon-ju. It's okay.
-Call an ambulance right now.

842
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,847
I'll give her a sedative
and clean her wounds.

843
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,764
[Sun-hwa] Okay.

844
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,474
[Hyeon-ju grunting]

845
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,726
[Sun-hwa] Hyeon-ju. It's okay.

846
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,645
Hyeon-ju. You're okay now.

847
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,274
[tense suspenseful music continues]

848
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,777
[keypad beeps]

849
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,821
EMERGENCY CALL

850
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,782
-[phone line ringing]
-[Hyeon-ju snarls]

851
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,620
[groans, sighs]

852
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,458
[breathes heavily]

853
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,296
[grunting softly]

854
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,716
-[Hyeon-ju] Too hot.
-Hang in there, Hyeon-ju.

855
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,051
Your temperature is a little too low.

856
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,719
Too hot. I'm too hot.

857
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,970
You're going to the hospital soon.

858
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,764
We're all here for you,
so don't worry, okay?

859
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,558
The science teacher gave me a weird shot.

860
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,393
A shot?

861
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,854
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan gave you a weird shot?

862
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,482
He tried to kill me.

863
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,650
[breathes shakily]

864
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,527
-Hey, Hyeon-ju, tell me what shot?
-[Hyeon-ju gasps]

865
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,613
I'm gonna kill them all.

866
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,239
-[shrieks]
-Hyeon-ju.

867
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,867
-[snarls]
-[gasps]

868
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,119
[Sun-hwa] Hey, are you okay?

869
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,538
-Hold her down so I can give her the shot.
-Okay.

870
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,792
Just a minute, okay?

871
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,127
Hyeon-ju. Just hang on.

872
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,176
[Hyo-ryeong] It's so strange.
Hyeon-ju was really odd.

873
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,177
-[Na-yeon] Yeah, totally.
-[Hyo-ryeong] It's weird.

874
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,430
Everyone else saw that, right?
First, she just disappeared all day,

875
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,266
then she comes in all bloody
talking about the science teacher.

876
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,435
She could have gone somewhere
and got hurt,

877
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,895
then came back here
and collapsed all of a sudden.

878
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,815
-It's got to be true.
-Did you hear something?

879
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,152
You know how we heard
his son went missing?

880
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,531
I heard he didn't go missing.

881
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,033
-Suicide.
-Come on, don't fall for that.

882
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:11,951
-That's silly.
-He committed suicide?

883
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,787
-You believe that?
-No, really. It's true, okay?

884
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,582
Hyeon-ju hung out with the same crowd
that bullied Jin-su all the time.

885
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,752
So the science teacher
went after them one-by-one.

886
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,878
He hunted them down.

887
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,756
-And kill them.
-Who said that?

888
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,008
-All his students.
-[Ji-min] Which one?

889
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,095
Last time I saw Hyeon-ju
was in the science lab.

890
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,221
[breathes sharply]
Hey.

891
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,682
I think maybe…

892
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,101
Mr. Lee made porn with Hyeon-ju.

893
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,978
-[Gyeong-su] Porn?
-Hey, you moron.

894
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,771
Get your mind out of the gutter, asshole.

895
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,856
[Wu-jin] You fat ass.

896
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,524
[Dae-su] Why are you cursing at me, dick?

897
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,025
[Wu-jin] Because you're a fucking pervert,
dumb ass.

898
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,527
[Dae-su] So why did he kidnap her then?

899
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,779
-Have you ever been kidnapped?
-Of course not. Stupid.

900
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,322
-Easy, I'm your brother-in-law.
-[scoffs]

901
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,074
-I told you to stop saying that.
-[grunts]

902
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,661
-[class clamoring]
-[student] Hey, tell us what happened?

903
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,164
I-sak, wait, what happened?

904
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,416
-[Gyeong-su] Hey, what happened?
-[Wu-jin] How is she?

905
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,584
[Hyo-ryeong] How's Hyeon-ju?

906
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,253
It's no joke.
She was biting people and trashing around…

907
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,171
Where's On-jo?

908
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,130
She got hurt.

909
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,299
Where? How bad?

910
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,508
She'll be fine.

911
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,093
Uh, Hyeon-ju bit her?

912
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,470
I think she went crazy.

913
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,972
[I-sak] Her temperature is super low,
but she said she was hot.

914
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,557
She tried to bite us.

915
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,225
-[Na-yeon] What the hell?
-So does she have rabies?

916
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,602
[Dae-su sighs]
What an idiot.

917
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,896
And Hyeon-ju had this weird smell.

918
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,023
-[Na-yeon] What smell?
-The same one as the science teacher.

919
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,524
-A rotting corpse.
-Yeah, that.

920
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,859
-I knew it.
-And she said,

921
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,736
Mr. Lee gave her some kind of weird shot.

922
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,404
What a total psycho.

923
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,823
-[class clamoring]
-Shouldn't we tell the police about this?

924
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,493
I don't know.
Ms. Park said she's gonna handle it.

925
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,204
Look…

926
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,498
She's just been sitting there studying.

927
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,416
Yeah, well, she is the top student.

928
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,544
-So? Where's On-jo?
-[I-sak] In the infirmary.

929
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,797
[suspenseful music]

930
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,519
[grunts]

931
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,729
It seems like she went
into shock due to hypothermia.

932
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,980
I manage to give her a sedative.

933
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,192
Okay. We'll take her to Hyosan Hospital.
Did you contact her parents?

934
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,487
Yeah. I did. They're on their way.
Please take good care of her.

935
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,821
-Will do.
-[nurse] Thank you.

937

Thank you.

938
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,785
-[On-jo's father] Are you okay?
-[nurse] That was scary.

939
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,620
Look at me. Were you scared?

940
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,871
Definitely.

941
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,790
[sighs]
Man.

942
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,085
So, what's wrong with her?

943
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,796
I don't know.
I'll tell you later when I get home.

944
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,132
I'm on calls, so I won't be home.

945
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,552
Just try not to get it wet.

946
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,428
Call me right away
if you need anything at all.

947
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,180
I'll rush right over. Okay?

948
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,307
-Okay.
-Good. Bye, hon.

949
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,852
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

950
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,398
Thank you and take good care
of her for me please.

951
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,482
Given the situation,

952
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,109
-I can't stick around.
-[Sun-hwa] Okay.

953
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,235
-Hurry up, Dad.
-[Sun-hwa] You should go.

954
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,320
[engine revving]

955
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,790
Thank you for your help, guys.

956
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,376
I'm going to head back in a few minutes…

957
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,214
Please make sure you don't tell anyone
about this just yet, okay?

958
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,340
-Yeah.
-Mm-hm.

959
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,258
[Sun-hwa] All right.

960
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,136
I think it's better not to tell anyone
for the time being.

961
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,178
Sounds good.

962
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,890
[Sun-hwa] Go back to class. Let's go.

963
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,311
Are you okay? Does she bite you?

Can you just tell me now?

No.

[Su-hyeok] Anyway, what's for lunch today?

1005
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,083
Do you have any idea?

1006

No! It's time for you
to explain yourself here.

We can't send Hyeon-ju to a hospital.

We have to put her in quarantine.

[yelling] Hey.

Sit down, Mr. Lee.

when you're at school
with the story about your son.

You should've called me
before calling an ambulance, Sun-hwa.

What do you think
is gonna happen if the police come?
