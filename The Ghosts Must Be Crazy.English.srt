1
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,320
Invisible to the naked eye
Doesn't mean it's not there

2
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,000
And seeing is not believing

3
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,240
Why does the truth seem so unreal?

4
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,200
While the fake seem so convincing?

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,840
It looks calm on the surface

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,799
But it is actually scheming to kill you

7
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,120
Some things are not what they seem

8
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,959
And some people are just not human

9
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,840
Don't think you will never meet a ghost

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:26,200
For you never know who is around you

11
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:33,319
Don't ever think there are no ghosts

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,920
Because you don't know what they look like

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,640
IN A FORESTED AREA IN THE 1990S

14
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,959
Why were we dispatched here?
Were there no other options?

15
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,120
I absolutely agree.

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,000
There are rumors
that this place is haunted.

17
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,879
I've heard that from my relatives, too.

18
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,920
Seven of them came here once for training,
only six left.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,239
I hear you, one of my cousins
told me the same story.

20
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,000
-He was here for training.
-Here?

21
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,480
Yes, here,
one week later after he came back,

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,280
he could miraculously speak
several languages.

23
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,039
Chinese, English, Spanish, rubbish.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,919
-Why?
-I don't know.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,240
He lost his ability to speak Malay.

26
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,159
What's this?

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,759
A tree root.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,319
I think it's hair.

29
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,159
Really?

30
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,360
Pig!

31
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,080
Barbie doll.

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,400
If it's really a Barbie doll,
pull it out if you are not afraid.

33
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,560
I am not scared.

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,599
I am pulling.

35
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,120
Barbie doll has a spring.

36
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,759
Seems like there is a spring attached.

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,039
Let me try.

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,520
I am sure it's hair.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,360
That's what I said earlier.

40
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,039
Do you smell something?

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
What is it?

42
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,479
I remember last week when I ate satay,

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,000
the taste of it still lingers in my mouth.

44
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,240
Forget about the satay,
it's the sauce that is unforgettable.

45
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,000
Shall we relive our fond memories there?

46
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,000
-Is the place still around?
-Sure.

47
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,759
-Of course...
-Of course...

48
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,360
Still there...

49
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,000
Still... there...

50
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,000
What is the Olympic record
for the 100-meter race?

51
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,080
It's 9.5 seconds.

52
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,240
Oh, yeah?

53
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,000
How fast can you run?

54
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,000
I think I will break that record
within four seconds. How about you?

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
Same, four seconds.

56
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,519
But there won't be witnesses around
to see us break the record.

57
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,360
And the two soldiers
were scared to death just like that.

58
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,399
I heard souls that die this way
cannot be reincarnated.

59
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,240
Their souls will never be appeased.

60
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,600
Wait, let me ask you,

61
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,399
do I look like your grandmother?

62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,759
No.

63
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,279
Then why are you telling me
a grandmother's story?

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,560
Sir, I am a medium.

65
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,560
My god has told me
our training area is haunted.

66
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,839
If I went there,
I would have to perform the rituals

67
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,319
to capture the spirits here,
to catch the spirits there.

68
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,000
Sir, I will definitely
mess up the exercise.

69
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,120
Sir, it's not me requesting
to be exempt from my duties,

70
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,199
it's my god requesting it.

71
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,240
So it's not you who wants to be exempted,

72
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,720
-it's your God.
-Yes, sir.

73
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,680
In that case,

74
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,000
please ask your God
to come see me about this.

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,319
If your God is not free to see me,

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,199
please ask your God to page me.

77
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,120
Understand?

78
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,319
Ask my god to page you?

79
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,439
Shut up! Get out!

80
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,279
If you fail this field exercise,
I'll make sure you are back here

81
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,399
and I'll teach you a lesson.

82
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
-F...
-No vulgarities, sir.

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,319
Chicken pie!

84
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,439
-Is that vulgar?
-No, sir.

85
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
What?

86
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Has your God asked you
to be excused as well?

87
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,000
No, sir.

88
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,040
I will not resort to unorthodox means,

89
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,879
to use spirits and God
to be excused from training.

90
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,399
I know this field exercise
is very important.

91
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,120
The safety of our nation depends on us.

92
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,120
Are you crazy? You idiot.

93
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,519
If you really believe that,
why are you here to ask for exemption?

94
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,639
Shut up.

95
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,040
You two get out!

96
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,680
Sir, I'm not here to ask for exemption.

97
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,920
It's because...

98
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,759
because...

99
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,079
my grandmother just passed away.

100
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,399
Grandma.

101
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,120
My dear grandma has passed away.

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,079
But you told me
she passed away last year.

103
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,439
The record is here.

104
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,079
Really?

105
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,240
That's my paternal grandmother.

106
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,240
This is my maternal grandmother.

107
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,199
My grandma...

108
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,120
Grandma!

109
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,079
Maternal grandmother?

110
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,240
But didn't she pass away
during in-camp two years ago?

111
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,319
Look at this record.

112
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,040
You took two days off.
That's your autograph, right?

113
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,639
It's all recorded.

114
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,519
Sir, I remember now.

115
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,279
That is my god-grandma,

116
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,879
and this is my maternal grandma.

117
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,800
How many grandmothers do you have?
How come they keep dying?

118
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,920
You can't say that
about my grandmother.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,639
If her time is up
and she has no time to inform me

120
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,639
before she passes away,
then I can't help it.

121
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,360
What do you mean you can't help it?

122
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,279
Every year during in-camp training,

123
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,920
all your grandmothers
will pass away in time

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
so that you've got an excuse to take off.

125
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,199
You two, you better go and f--

126
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,040
No vulgarities, sir.

127
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,680
...fly out before I fail
your in-camp this year,

128
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,639
and make sure you return to join me
for one more exercise!

129
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,959
Sir! We are here for reservist training,
we are no longer recruits.

130
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,040
I advise you to close one eye sometimes,
so life will be easier for everyone.

131
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,000
You two get out. Close the door.

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,920
Sir, what are you doing?

133
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,800
I will show you who is the boss here.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,279
Don't say I'm pulling rank.

135
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,159
Come!

136
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,080
Attention soldiers!

137
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,200
March off!

138
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,200
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

139
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,440
Trying to get day off?

140
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,600
It'll be tough.

141
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,440
Good morning, sir.

142
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,720
You also want to be excused, is that it?

143
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,200
Sir, it's okay if you can't
grant me a day off,

144
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,399
but can you excuse me
from the field training?

145
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,799
I am sick.

146
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,879
I have internal injuries.
You know what I mean?

147
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,200
I have internal injuries. Inside the body.

148
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,960
-You should report to the Medical Officer.
-I can't.

149
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,759
This is my last in-camp training.

150
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,759
If I report sick,
I will have to stay in the sick bay,

151
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,120
then I will have to
come back again next year.

152
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,720
Sir, I can't afford to come back
for training next year.

153
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,559
This sickish chicken
is really good at feigning sickness.

154
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,159
Sir.

155
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,000
Good prop.

156
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,480
You're from SBC, right?
A props man, right?

157
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,159
He even coughed blood.

158
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,799
Really professional,
he even prepared props.

159
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,960
What about you?

160
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,320
His cough is so unconvincing.

161
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,720
If he manages to get an exemption,
I will...

162
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,919
Sir, I am not lying,

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,240
I am really suffering
from internal injuries.

164
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
I will not make things difficult for you.

165
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,279
Can you grant me light duty instead?

166
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,559
All of you know defense exercise
is very tough,

167
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,279
so you cook up all sorts of excuses.

168
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,720
Hello, you think
I just joined army yesterday, is it?

169
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,039
Being skinny and frail
will get you nowhere.

170
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,600
I can still detect your lies.

171
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,799
Wake up, soldier!

172
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,120
You want to idle, I'll make sure

173
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,240
you come back again next year!

174
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,600
Is that clear?

175
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,559
Darn!

176
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,759
This officer is really very XL.

177
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,799
XL? Extra-large?

178
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,080
It's a vulgarity in English.
I bet you do not know what it means.

179
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,639
X-I-A L-A-N.

180
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,799
X-I-A L-A-N.

181
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,919
You liar!

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,440
This is a Hokkien vulgarity.

183
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,080
Of course I know what it means.

184
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,159
The sickish chicken is here.
Come here.

185
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,639
I tell you, cut the acting.

186
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,039
The officer is not here.

187
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,519
We all know you work
in the props department.

188
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,639
-Stop acting.
-I am really sick.

189
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
If not for your interruption just now,

190
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,320
we would have gotten our leave approved.

191
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,159
It's all your fault.

192
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,159
Stop!

193
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,000
Good afternoon, Encik.

194
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,600
Bloody hell, you again!

195
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,559
Last year when I caught you,

196
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,879
you promised me
that you won't color your hair.

197
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,200
This year I caught you,
still the same color.

198
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,639
It's not the same.

199
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,159
Last year, yellow color.
This year, gold color.

200
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,840
How dare you talk back to me!

201
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,159
You don't respect me, huh?

202
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,600
Please don't take it that way.

203
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,000
This is our last in-camp.

204
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,960
We are reservists, not recruits.

205
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,320
So what?

206
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,480
I want this color to be black.

207
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,080
Just like this?

208
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,200
Yeah.

209
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,440
Please cut me some slack.

210
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,440
Okay, I'll give you two options.

211
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,320
One, become like this.

212
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,480
One, become like this.

213
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:47,039
Trying to be smart

214
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,039
Shut up.

215
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,480
Trying to be smart

216
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,399
What are you doing?

217
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,440
I'm helping you polish up.

218
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,440
Lower, please.

219
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,320
What are you doing?
Why are you spitting on my head?

220
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,399
What is this?

221
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,639
We are even.

222
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,039
I caught you both!

223
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,559
What can two men be doing at the stairway?

224
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,200
Chinese pretending to be a Caucasian

225
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,600
But he can't even speak English

226
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,559
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

227
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,039
Isn't this English?

228
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,519
This is my head,
it does not belong to the Army.

229
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,480
Why are they still so strict
for our last training?

230
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,039
Irritating officer.
I wish you'd get killed by a car!

231
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Which officer is that?

232
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,159
The bald Encik Muthu!

233
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,200
You really saw him?

234
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,480
Of course. What's wrong?

235
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,519
He was killed in a car crash last year.

236
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,240
You are spouting rubbish!

237
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,200
Really, he died last year
in a terrible accident.

238
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,279
Didn't you read the newspapers?
He even lost his head in the crash.

239
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,639
It's a very serious case.

240
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,600
You guys are really evil.

241
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,919
You can't joke about this, it's unethical.

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,279
Time to draw weapons.

243
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,799
You better go pray for protection.

244
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,240
Go pray.

245
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,279
Platoon. Fall in.

246
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,399
Platoon. Stand at ease.

247
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,919
Okay, gentlemen, this defense exercise
is our last exercise.

248
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,159
After this, no more in-camp training.

249
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,039
All of us will go ORD.

250
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,200
Anyway, I will read out the details
for tonight's exercise.

251
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,080
Detail one.

252
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,240
Corporal Tan,

253
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Corporal Lim.

254
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,720
Detail two.

255
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,279
Corporal Goh...

256
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,080
Look, Encik!

257
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,159
Where?

258
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,039
Where?

259
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,600
Not there anymore.

260
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,360
Don't frighten me, I have no guts.

261
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,440
...Lance Corporal Soh.

262
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,080
Detail Three.

263
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,759
Corporal Koh, Private Teo.

264
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,679
Look!

265
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,919
Encik!

266
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,159
Who says I'm dead?

267
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,279
Who says I died in an accident?

268
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,000
We have been sabotaged by them.

269
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,279
You are afraid of ghosts?

270
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,159
You too?

271
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,000
You look like a ghost yourself,
and you are scared?

272
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,759
Don't you dare make fun of me.
I'll tell your wife

273
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,120
you're fooling around with two women!

274
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,360
Quiet!

275
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,399
-Is this a holiday camp?
-No, sir.

276
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,080
-Is this a marketplace?
-No, sir.

277
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,279
What's going on?

278
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Sir, every time, they say I die.
Every time, they say I die.

279
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm superstitious.

280
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,000
Encik, I know you are not dead,
but if we don't move out now,

281
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,399
we will be late,
and then we will be dead.

282
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,519
Yes, sir.

283
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,840
And?

284
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,679
Everybody on standby, move out!

285
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,000
A corporal has two black stripes

286
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,000
A sergeant has three black stripes

287
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,000
Three black stripes plus a crest

288
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,840
We call them Company Sergeant Major

289
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:25,000
Please fall sick, CSM!

290
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,600
Please be killed in an accident...

291
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,080
Quiet!

292
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,720
You think you are singing karaoke?

293
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,200
You think there's no government?

294
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,159
Bloody hell!

295
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,360
My grandmother can move faster than you!

296
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,840
Move, move! Come on!

297
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,440
Very good!

298
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,559
They are fighting the battle.

299
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,000
Both of you are smoking and hiding here.

300
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,400
Move, bloody hell!

301
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,079
Move!

302
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,119
This is such a big training area.
So tiring.

303
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,000
Wonder where our platoon mates are now.

304
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,400
-How did you get the egg?
-I brought it myself.

305
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,359
You can have some in exchange
for your luncheon meat.

306
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,680
What is this?

307
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,160
How come there's three men,
but only one shell scrape?

308
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,480
Encik, this one's mine.

309
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,480
Encik, we are sharing it.

310
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,920
-How?
-I'll show you.

311
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,720
Demonstration Alpha!

312
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,440
It's possible to share.

313
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,119
Wake up!

314
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Relax, please!

315
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,200
Demonstration Bravo!

316
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,160
Fire!

317
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,519
Position change!

318
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,079
Position change!

319
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,440
Position change!

320
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,799
Position change!

321
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,160
Change!

322
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,039
Change your head up, bloody hell!

323
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,839
I don't know how you pass your BMT!

324
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,480
What's that smell?

325
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
No, not this one.

326
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,799
What's that?
Can you go and get it for me?

327
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Yes, Encik.

328
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Encik.

329
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,319
Encik, this is my Chinese medicine.

330
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,039
What kind of medicine is this?

331
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,519
Encik, I'm sick.

332
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,559
Inside one.

333
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,480
How can you cook
Chinese medicine in the field?

334
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,200
Are you crazy?

335
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,480
If you are sick,
then you should report yourself.

336
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,720
Not that I don't like
your Chinese medicine,

337
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,319
not that I wanted to scold you...

338
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,440
During wartime, if you cook in the jungle,

339
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,839
enemy's aircraft fly past,
if they see the fire,

340
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,319
they will bombard the whole area

341
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,240
and all of us will die. Die!

342
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,319
Understand?

343
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,039
You and I will also die!

344
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,519
-Do you understand?
-Yes, Encik.

345
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,480
Let me give you another example!

346
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,240
During wartime,

347
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,839
if you cook in the jungle,

348
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,200
enemy's aircraft fly above,

349
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,880
if they see the fire, same thing,

350
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,119
they will bombard the whole area!

351
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,559
You will die! I will die!

352
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,599
Everybody will die!

353
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,759
-Understand?
-Yes, Encik.

354
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:35,240
Let me give you another example!

355
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,839
If you cook in the jungle,

356
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,079
enemy's aircraft fly above,

357
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,880
if they see the fire,

358
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,599
they will bombard the whole area!

359
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,480
You will die! I will die!

360
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,480
Everybody will die!

361
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,759
Is that clear?

362
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,559
Yes, Encik.

363
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,799
I don't think you understand!

364
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,960
Let me give you one final example!

365
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,400
For example,

366
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,400
if I cook in the jungle...

367
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,640
...the enemy aircraft fly above...

368
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,000
...see the fire...

369
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,960
...and bombard the whole area.

370
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,599
-You will die.
-I will die.

371
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,079
Everybody will die.

372
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,559
Very good!

373
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,519
Finally you understood what I said!

374
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,440
So, no more cooking in the jungle!

375
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,599
Do a proper job for the fire trench later,
understand?

376
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,039
Yes, Encik.

377
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,000
It's all your fault, you sickish chicken!

378
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,480
Why must you brew Chinese medicine?

379
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,720
I'm having tummy ache
and need to defecate.

380
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,039
Yeah.

381
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,680
Me too.

382
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,640
Sickish chicken,

383
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,000
we have been gone so long,
that's all you have managed to dig?

384
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,160
Don't try to pretend!
You better dig faster!

385
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,039
Or I will beat you
till you shrink by three inches!

386
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,240
You want a beating?
This is the best durian.

387
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,759
Where did you find it?

388
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,039
Dropped from the tree.

389
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,319
Encik is here.

390
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,519
Carry the durian.

391
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,079
How come three of you only dig like that?

392
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,519
Encik, hair!

393
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,440
I have no hair.

394
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,480
There's hair at the bottom of the trench.

395
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,799
There are ghosts here.

396
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,119
So what?

397
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,799
My god tells me

398
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,400
someone has died here.

399
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,359
Encik, better tell C.O.

400
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,000
Exercise, cut!

401
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,160
Cut? I will cut your head!

402
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,400
I'm in the Army for 35 years.

403
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,799
If you happen to see the ghost again,

404
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,119
tell the ghost to come and report to me.

405
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,960
I will throw him into the Guard Room.

406
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,160
Okay?

407
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,079
Stupid Encik!

408
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,079
Hope you will really meet with a ghost!

409
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,440
My God, please let Encik
meet with a ghost,

410
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,960
or please let a ghost meet with Encik.

411
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,240
Thank you, God.

412
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,119
Lord Ganesha,

413
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,240
brothers and sisters,

414
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,960
I have not committed anything wrong.

415
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,799
Now it seems like I am the one at fault.

416
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,799
It's okay if you don't
show me any respect,

417
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,119
but please show him some respect.

418
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,559
The ruler of kings.

419
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,079
What's that?

420
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,920
Devil!

421
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,200
Stupid Encik!

422
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,319
Stupid bald man!

423
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,599
Why did he run so fast?

424
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,279
He must have seen a ghost.

425
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:11,160
Let's hurry back
before our ploy is exposed.

426
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,759
I swear,
I saw the ghost here, sir.

427
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,200
Encik, we are soldiers,
please stop this nonsense.

428
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,960
Why don't you believe what I say?

429
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,519
I saw it with my own eyes.

430
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,200
Please change the channel!

431
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,039
I saw the ghost with my own two eyes.

432
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,799
-You sure you saw the ghost?
-Yes.

433
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,200
-You confirm you saw the ghost?
-Confirm.

434
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,079
Then next time you see the ghost,
you ask the ghost to report to me.

435
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,079
Okay.

436
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,400
I will charge the ghost,

437
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,119
I will throw the ghost
into the Guard Room.

438
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,519
-Okay?
-Okay.

439
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,279
Quick. Keep it quick...
Before the officer finds out.

440
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,359
You have no guts to come with us
to scare Encik!

441
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,759
Really a chicken!

442
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,079
What happened to your face?

443
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,160
I'm really ill.

444
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,880
Still putting on an act in front of us?
Are you after the best actor award?

445
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,079
Officer is here.

446
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,279
Believe me! Trust me!

447
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,079
Hello, just now, all of you
saw the ghost with long hair

448
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,079
flying here and flying there?

449
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,680
Don't be like that.
I really saw the ghost.

450
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:37,000
I saw it, so scary.

451
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,119
This place is haunted.

452
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,720
There's no ghost in this world.

453
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,480
Ghosts only exist in here.

454
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,440
If you think there's a ghost,
there will be.

455
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,759
If you think there's no ghost,
there won't be any. Understand?

456
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,839
Yes, sir.

457
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,200
Sickish chicken!

458
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,960
Sir, see, he is down.

459
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,079
Just see for yourself,
I told you this place is really haunted.

460
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,039
I think it would be better
to terminate the exercise.

461
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,079
Shut up!
Don't teach me what to do!

462
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,200
-Encik.
-Yes, sir.

463
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,440
-Call the medics.
-The medic has reported sick.

464
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,039
-What?
-The medic is also human being.

465
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,119
Sir, I will bring him
to the medical center.

466
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,599
-Go!
-Yes, sir.

467
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,039
Don't worry.

468
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,000
I will get him
to the medical center safely.

469
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,119
Crazy!

470
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,000
I'll ask both of you again.

471
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,839
-You really saw the long-haired ghost?
-Yes, sir.

472
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,519
That ghost is really terrifying.

473
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:36,160
-So that ghost is for real?
-For real.

474
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,680
So your rites
to get rid of ghosts are fake?

475
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,160
It's for real, too.

476
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,480
For real? The ghost appeared.
Where's your God?

477
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,000
Sir, I know the answer.

478
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:51,960
-His god is on medical leave.
-Stop talking nonsense!

479
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,279
Your god is just like you.
Always faking your way through.

480
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,680
-No, sir.
-You two lazy Privates!

481
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,039
From National Service
till Reservist Training,

482
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,160
you two have been faking it all this time!

483
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,079
How long do you want to
continue like this?

484
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,039
I know you want to be excused
from the exercise.

485
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,319
You will do anything.

486
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,359
Let me tell you this,
I am not scared of anything.

487
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,200
If I catch you one more time,

488
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,079
I will make sure
you fail this year's training,

489
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,279
and come back next year.

490
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,160
Don't challenge me!

491
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,119
You are a pig!
You are a banana!

492
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,279
You are an ice-cream!

493
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,079
What kind of God do you have?

494
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,599
Nothing good comes along.

495
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,279
But the bad ones, you have it all.

496
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,000
You have it all...

497
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:38,039
Shut up and start digging.

498
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,039
Are you okay? Can you answer me?

499
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,079
Ah Tan!

500
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Encik.

501
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,240
Can you stop talking?

502
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,200
Let me rest for a while.

503
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,079
Then can you answer my questions?

504
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,039
If not, I will assume you are dead,
Ah Tan.

505
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,880
My God! Don't die in my car!

506
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,160
Ah Tan?

507
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,079
Ah Tan, are you okay?

508
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,839
Ah Tan?

509
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:32,119
I can't control it anymore.

510
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,960
How dare that stupid officer
say I'm a fake medium?

511
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:38,079
-But you are a fake.
-Now you are after me, too?

512
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,160
-What do you plan to do?
-Look at how frightened Encik was.

513
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,160
Now it's time to scare the officer.

514
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,160
I will put on my nails,

515
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:49,880
wear my wig,
apply some fake blood...

516
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,759
And we will put on
the white contact lenses.

517
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:57,000
Let's give him a really good scare
and that will send him crawling.

518
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,079
Then the exercise
will definitely be terminated.

519
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
I will bet my money on this.

520
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,119
There's something there.

521
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,119
"If I had known earlier."

522
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,279
He is one of us.

523
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,119
What did you say just now?

524
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,039
Secret code.

525
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,279
I almost forgot.

526
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,119
He is one of us.

527
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,160
Who is it?

528
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:09,119
Hey. Who is it?

529
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,160
Stop the act.

530
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,039
Who is it?

531
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,200
Don't frighten me.

532
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,160
Stop the act.

533
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,079
Is that Tan?

534
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:25,839
Sickish chicken?

535
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,079
I am a medium, so I'm not afraid.

536
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,119
Sickish chicken.

537
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,000
I thought you went to the medical center.

538
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,519
Why did you come back?
And with make-up, too?

539
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:43,119
You don't have the guts to scare Encik,
but now you are pretending

540
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,920
to be a ghost with special white lenses!
You deserve a beating!

541
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,160
Don't think we are afraid of you!

542
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,920
We have what it takes, too.
Show it to him.

543
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,480
These are old tricks in movies.
I know the tricks too. See?

544
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:09,119
I know how to do it, too.

545
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,000
Go and give the officer a scare now.

546
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,679
-Make sure it's a real scare.
-Make sure he collapses from fright.

547
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,599
Make sure he terminates the exercise,
or I will make sure you get a beating.

548
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,920
When you are doing it,

549
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,599
don't get too worked up
or the make-up might peel off.

550
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,119
And your identity will be exposed.

551
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,119
Sir, die!

552
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
You said I'm dead?

553
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,039
Bloody hell, talk properly!

554
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,400
Tan is dead!

555
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,920
-Tan is dead?
-Yes, sir.

556
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I was driving him to the medical center,

557
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:58,039
the Land Rover crashed,
that's how Ah Tan is dead!

558
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,840
-Are you sure Tan is dead?
-I'm very sure Tan died.

559
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,119
Are you sure Tan is dead?

560
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,599
I'm very sure Tan is dead because of me!

561
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:11,119
But Tan is behind you!

562
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,000
What are you trying to do?

563
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,000
Are you trying to scare me?

564
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,119
Ghost!

565
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:35,000
Darn!

566
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,039
Encik!

567
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,000
You are really upsetting me.

568
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,119
Other people said you died,
you are not happy.

569
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,079
But you keep saying other people are dead.

570
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,719
You said Tan is dead.
But he is not dead?

571
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,039
Tan is right here!

572
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,159
Encik!

573
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:50,119
Please don't make me treat you
like a private soldier?

574
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,639
Go check on the men!

575
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Yes, sir.

576
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,119
-Then?
-Okay.

577
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,000
God, please save me!

578
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,039
The sickish chicken
is really good at his act.

579
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,000
Encik has fled with fear.

580
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,159
Those not in the know
may really think he's a ghost.

581
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,159
Why are you still here?

582
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,000
Do you still want an exemption?

583
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:43,199
Still want light duty?

584
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,480
Darn!

585
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,079
Don't frighten me!

586
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:53,119
From the first day
you said you were sick,

587
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,159
I asked you to go see the medical officer,
you rejected the idea.

588
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:58,039
Now that you have seen
the medical officer,

589
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,039
you are still not excused,
that proves that I was right.

590
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:05,159
Tan is dead already.

591
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,960
Now you come back here
and pretend you are sick?

592
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,039
Or pretend you are dead?

593
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,119
Encik.

594
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,079
We just spoke to
the sickish chicken a while ago.

595
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:20,000
We met with an accident earlier on
and he died.

596
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,239
If you don't believe me, look.

597
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,280
Tan is dead.

598
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:25,840
He's dead.

599
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,960
If you don't believe me,
go see for yourself.

600
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,199
Tan is dead.

601
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,159
You are a faker, always faking.

602
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:35,239
You think I'm stupid?

603
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,280
You want a day off.

604
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,039
Hatch a plan.

605
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:48,159
Come up with a story at least
show me some sincerity.

606
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,119
Is that some trick?

607
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:59,039
That's a good move, smooth and fast.

608
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,119
And you are here already.

609
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:05,039
Do you think I don't know this?

610
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,840
Do you think I'm a rookie?

611
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,320
When I was writing,
this is what you did, right?

612
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,000
Like this?

613
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,280
Like this?

614
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,280
I can do it, too.

615
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,039
I can do it, too.

616
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,000
Michael Jackson was my neighbor.

617
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:22,119
You fake!

618
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,800
If you had given me sick leave,
or given me light duty,

619
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,119
then I would not have died.

620
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,280
That's quite creative!

621
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:38,079
Normally,
when the men come to ask for leave,

622
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,159
they will say their grandparents
or someone has died.

623
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:42,159
You said you died.

624
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,840
Just put on some powder and expect me
to believe you're dead?

625
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,119
But you don't look dead.

626
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,079
This is very good, very fast.

627
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:06,440
You stuck so much
broken glass on your face.

628
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,679
Within seconds!

629
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Let's run!

630
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,280
We are doomed!

631
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,280
Sickish chicken is back for revenge!

632
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,000
It's all your fault,
you have been bullying him!

633
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,199
Have you ever been kind to him?

634
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,199
You are the bigger bully!

635
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:43,079
We are doomed! This time we are doomed!

636
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:45,039
Encik, it's all your fault!

637
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,159
If only you didn't crash the vehicle!

638
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,039
This is where the vehicle crashed.

639
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,239
Yes, the vehicle has really crashed.

640
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,480
Tan died here.

641
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:59,079
There are trees everywhere.

642
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,920
I can see Tan's body.

643
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,159
Tan is dead...

644
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,119
Tan is dead...

645
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,159
Sickish chicken, you are dead!

646
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,159
Look!

647
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,079
-Why is there another body?
-Who could it be?

648
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,920
Encik!

649
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,079
This time I'm dead for real!

650
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,280
I'm really dead.

651
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,559
I'm dead...

652
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:52,000
I'm dead...

653
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,159
My leave has been approved.

654
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:04,679
ONLY GHOSTS WILL MARRY YOU
DIRECTOR, LI GUOHUANG

655
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,119
Keep your mouth smaller.

656
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,559
Just stick your tongue out.

657
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,559
You bit me!

658
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,679
Do you know how to kiss?

659
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,079
Darn!

660
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:29,159
How dare you fool around behind my back?

661
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,679
How dare you fool around with my woman?

662
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,079
I am your ex-girlfriend.

663
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,559
To think I treated you so well!

664
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,960
You should thank the gods for it!

665
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:40,599
You were good to me?
Do you own a house?

666
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
No.

667
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,239
He does.
Do you own a car?

668
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:45,920
No.

669
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,039
He does. And you expect me
to spend my life with you?

670
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:50,079
Cut the crap about how I am the moon
and you are my sunshine,

671
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,920
and stop saying you are my bra
and I am your brief,

672
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,159
and you can't walk properly without me!

673
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,360
What era are we living in?

674
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,519
Who says these things anymore?

675
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,159
You are nothing compared to my darling!

676
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:04,000
You want to compare?

677
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,519
I am shorter!

678
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,559
I am uglier!

679
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:10,280
I am older!

680
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,079
My darling has something that is longer.

681
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:15,159
It is not the length.
It is not the size.

682
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:18,800
The important is,
he can do how many times?

683
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,039
Your English is atrocious

684
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,840
and you have a filthy mind!

685
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:25,159
Let me ask you,
how will you say I love you?

686
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,280
I love you.

687
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,519
Not the least bit sincere.

688
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,679
How will you say it?

689
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,159
I...

690
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:35,480
love...

691
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Some more.

692
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,079
Love...

693
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,159
Some more.

694
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:41,239
Love...

695
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,000
Some more.

696
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,119
Love... you.

697
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:49,119
That felt good.

698
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
Hear that?

699
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,000
My darling can "love" me
much "longer" than you.

700
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:54,079
Let's go!

701
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,039
Let's go to somewhere else to kiss!

702
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:57,679
I have not had my fill, I need more!

703
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:00,039
Don't go!

704
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,199
You said you would marry me.

705
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,800
Let go of me!

706
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:04,199
I am not marrying you.

707
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,880
Only a ghost will marry you.

708
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:19,079
Let's go, darling. Let's go
to Mount Faber to continue our kiss.

709
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:55,159
Just broke up?

710
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,760
Hey.

711
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:00,079
Who are you?

712
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,159
It is not important who I am.

713
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:04,199
There are still many good girls out there.

714
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,000
Let that fat lump of lard go.

715
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,119
I have been dumped by
more than 20 girlfriends.

716
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:12,159
So I lowered my expectations,

717
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:15,000
and found myself a fat and ugly girl.

718
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,119
Yet she still left me.
I am useless.

719
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,079
It is not a problem.

720
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:22,159
If you are rich,
women will come to you.

721
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:24,119
But I have no money!

722
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:26,079
Don't tell me I have to rob and steal?

723
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:28,199
I am over 50 years old,
I don't have the energy anymore.

724
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,039
Don't tell me I have to borrow
more from loan sharks?

725
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:35,199
If I have a way for you to strike it rich
without having to break the law,

726
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,000
do you dare to try?

727
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,119
If I can strike the lottery,
I'll try anything!

728
00:45:58,119 --> 00:45:59,199
Why did you bring me here?

729
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:03,119
This place has
the best fengshui in Singapore.

730
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,079
The descendants
of those whose urns are placed here

731
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:08,280
will always enjoy good fortune and luck.

732
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,199
What has it got to do with me?

733
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,159
Follow me.

734
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:17,159
These people
had good fortune and luck

735
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:20,039
that was not totally used up
before they passed away.

736
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,199
So I have brought you here

737
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,079
to "borrow"
some good fortune and luck from them.

738
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:34,199
To "borrow"
good fortune and luck from the deceased?

739
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,039
Don't be afraid.

740
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:40,159
I have brought many people here,
and they have all struck it rich.

741
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,239
However, you must abide by the rules.

742
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,000
If you have gotten what you asked for,
you must return what you have promised.

743
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:48,039
Understand?

744
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:49,119
Relax.

745
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,079
I will definitely do that
if I win the lottery.

746
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:55,079
Tell them what you want.

747
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,519
I, Ong Kim Hui--

748
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,159
Are you trying to wake up the dead?

749
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,119
Keep your voice down.

750
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,000
I, Ong Kim Hui, am penniless,

751
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:13,440
so all my girlfriends
left me for other men,

752
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,039
even with a fat and ugly one,

753
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:18,079
and I have borrowed money
from the loan sharks.

754
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,000
Payment is due in two days.

755
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:26,039
May all good brothers
from the netherworld bless me,

756
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:27,119
so I can win the lottery.

757
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:28,599
If I do,

758
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,280
I will return to thank all of you
with car-loads of paper ingots.

759
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,199
Thank you very much.

760
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:39,039
Prosperity!

761
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,119
You said the people you brought here
have all become rich?

762
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,400
Of course.

763
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:47,000
Did they get the top prizes?

764
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:48,000
Or any numbers they bet on
will hit the jackpot?

765
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,039
Or just consolation prizes?

766
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,719
The last one struck second prize,
followed by first prize the next day.

767
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,679
Really?

768
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,159
Of course,
I will be a ghost if I lie to you.

769
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,000
What's that red thing on the floor?

770
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:00,159
Red packet.

771
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,119
-Don't pick it up, don't pick it up.
-Already did.

772
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:05,079
-Don't open it, don't open it.
-Too late.

773
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:07,000
You are hopeless,
how can you just open it like that?

774
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:08,199
Don't put it on.

775
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,280
It's on.

776
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,639
How dare you pick up,
open and wear anything from here?

777
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:16,119
You are really mad!

778
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:19,159
You have the guts to come here
to "borrow" fortune and luck,

779
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,039
but you are frightened by a red packet?

780
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,159
Since I was young,
I have treaded on numerous paths,

781
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,760
but I have never once
found a red packet.

782
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:30,039
It's fate. So smooth.

783
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,840
-What did you just say?
-Smooth as silk.

784
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,840
-The line before that.
-It's fate.

785
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,920
Beg your pardon?

786
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,719
Fate...

787
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,880
Go eat shit if you don't understand!

788
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:43,000
You are really hopeless.

789
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:47,199
There are two sets
of numbers in here. Look!

790
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:50,039
0-3-2-9.

791
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:52,960
1-2-2-8. You betting?

792
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:54,679
Save it for yourself.

793
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,760
I wouldn't dare to bet on
anything found here.

794
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,840
Not betting?

795
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,079
If these numbers emerge
as top prize, don't regret it.

796
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,519
Still not interested?
I am going ahead.

797
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,679
What a stroke of luck!

798
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Are you stupid?

799
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,239
Your hands are clumsy like your legs,
your legs are as clumsy as pig trotters.

800
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,559
It's better to engage
a pig than employ you!

801
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:28,079
If you break my bowls,
I will deduct your pay!

802
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:29,079
Pig!

803
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,559
-Be careful!
-It's you!

804
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,039
You came in time to save me
or my pay will go down the drain today.

805
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,119
If you need help, I will always be here.
Where shall I put these?

806
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:53,199
-To the wash area.
-I'll help you, allow me.

807
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:00,320
Don't you have to work?

808
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:02,159
I wanted to be a teacher,

809
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:05,199
but they didn't allow me
to keep my long hair, so I quit.

810
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,039
I wanted to be a principal,
but I prefer washing dishes.

811
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:11,639
You are funny.

812
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:17,800
1-2-2-8.

813
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,039
Isn't 1-2-2-8 the number you bet on?

814
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,000
You are right! What a waste.

815
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,400
I just bet $10 big and $10 small!

816
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,239
I would have placed
more bets if I had known!

817
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:30,159
So long as you have won,
it's a good thing already.

818
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,159
0-3-2-9.

819
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,880
Isn't that
the number in the red packet?

820
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,480
-You are absolutely right!
-You are so lucky!

821
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:45,679
I bet $30 big and $30 small
on this number!

822
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:49,960
Did you place any bets?

823
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:51,079
No, the luck is yours.

824
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:52,159
If I had placed any bets,
you might not win.

825
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:53,880
I told you to bet on the numbers!

826
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,719
I told you these might be winning numbers!
You just did not listen to me!

827
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:01,000
Since I was young,
I have never won any top prize!

828
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:02,119
Top prize!

829
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:10,119
How dare you play with my water?

830
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:12,039
Water charges
are getting higher and higher!

831
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:14,519
If you dare waste my water,
I will deduct your pay!

832
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,239
Are you all right?

833
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,159
Can you confirm that
1-2-2-8 is the second prize number?

834
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:24,679
Yes.

835
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,039
And 0-3-2-9 is the top prize number?

836
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,079
Yes, confirmed.

837
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:35,000
-Boss.
-What?

838
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:36,199
You are a pig! Pig!

839
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,360
-Are you crazy?
-You are a pig!

840
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,079
Your father is a boar.
Your mother is a sow.

841
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:43,039
You are the pig!

842
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,719
LOTTERY PRIZE NUMBER - TOP PRIZE : 0329
SECOND PRIZE : 1228 - THIRD PRIZE : 9648

843
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,960
Here's $50,000 to repay
the $30,000 debt!

844
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:56,000
You blood sucker!

845
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:01,039
This is your IOU.

846
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:40,119
Scissors, paper, stone!

847
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:42,199
You lost!

848
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:47,199
Here's $100 for you.
I want it too.

849
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,039
Once more.

850
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:52,039
Scissors, paper, stone!

851
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:55,280
Backside up for beating
for those who lose!

852
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,880
These are for you.

853
00:52:58,039 --> 00:52:59,000
You all lose.

854
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:01,199
Come.

855
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,119
Scissors, paper, stone!

856
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:06,159
She is pretty!

857
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:08,039
Here's $200 for you!

858
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:11,239
All yours!

859
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:19,559
What do you want?

860
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,079
What... What do you want?

861
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,159
You know what?

862
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:30,280
You broke my heart when you left me.

863
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:33,039
The saddest part is

864
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:36,360
you said he beat me
in length, in everything.

865
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:38,039
You are right.

866
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:39,199
I like my dearie

867
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,159
because he beats you
in terms of length, in everything.

868
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:43,239
Long...

869
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,559
Being long is good. Being long is heaven.

870
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:48,119
"Long is good"?

871
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,559
"Long is heaven"?

872
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:52,960
Hey! Open it!

873
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,360
I'll give you a cage now
to send you to heaven!

874
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,840
Push her in!

875
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,079
Hands off! Release me!

876
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,079
Hands off!

877
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,239
Let me out!

878
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,800
Let me out!

879
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:19,199
You like long things?

880
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:24,000
I'll give you something very long now.

881
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,280
Look at her, so pitiful.

882
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:36,960
Let me out!

883
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,960
Relax, we were once lovers.
Why would I harm you?

884
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:44,719
So long as your dearie
can count to three,

885
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,840
I will let you out.

886
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,039
It's extremely easy
to count to three, right?

887
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,159
Let me out!

888
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,599
Start now!

889
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:56,920
Quickly, open it!

890
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,199
One...

891
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,119
One...

892
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:37,119
Since my youth,

893
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,239
I have never seen
a snake with broken teeth!

894
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,199
One...

895
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,119
Shout two!

896
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:47,159
Shout two!

897
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,280
You know it is hungry?

898
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,960
Let me tell you.

899
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,880
This snake has not eaten for a month!

900
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:04,599
Your dearie has my full respect.

901
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:06,159
I have given him
such a short and easy task,

902
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:08,079
he can drag it to such great length!

903
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:09,199
One...

904
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,880
Can you count to two faster,
you're still at...

905
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,000
One...

906
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,199
Release her when he can count to three!

907
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:21,519
Do you know why a cobra
does not put on spectacles?

908
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:24,000
Because it wears contact lenses instead!

909
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:25,199
I will buy you drinks, let's go!

910
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,960
One...

911
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:28,239
Count to two!

912
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,960
Five, five, three.
Total 13 points on big!

913
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:39,800
-Here's your winnings, $2000.
-I won!

914
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:42,199
Money!

915
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,599
$10,000 in just half an hour!
Let's go. I'll buy you a meal!

916
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,000
You have successfully
"borrowed" good fortune and luck.

917
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,280
Besides winning the lottery,
you have won in everything you bet on.

918
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,400
Those who have "borrowed"
the good fortune,

919
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,039
they will win till they drop
on the gambling table.

920
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,760
Do a few more games.

921
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,199
You might just triple your winnings.

922
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:07,119
You are right.

923
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,079
You stay here and watch me win, okay?

924
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,000
One, three, six.

925
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:24,280
Ten points on small.

926
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,920
Four, five, six.
15 points on big.

927
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:42,239
One, two, three,
six points on small.

928
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,719
Three, four, five,
twelve points on big.

929
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:01,159
Triple six!

930
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,480
Banker wins!

931
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,039
He has left on seeing me lose.

932
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,239
Hands off the table.

933
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,039
Three, four, five,
12 points on big.

934
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,239
Should have quit when I was winning,
now I have lost every penny!

935
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,039
-Don't frighten me!
-What is it?

936
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,800
Where were you yesterday?

937
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:29,199
You left me alone
to go to the parking lot.

938
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,039
It was very dark there.

939
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:32,320
I'll tell you what happened,

940
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,360
a few thousands urns surrounded me.

941
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:39,239
They came from the front,
from the back, from the left,

942
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:44,039
from the right,
in the end, one exploded in front of me!

943
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,000
No one has ever chased me before,

944
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:49,760
and now I am being chased by urns!

945
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:53,199
When we "borrowed"
the good fortune and luck,

946
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,920
you promised that if you won the lottery,

947
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,519
you will burn car-loads
of paper ingots for them.

948
01:00:58,599 --> 01:00:59,599
Did you forget about it?

949
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,159
You are right, I forgot.

950
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:06,360
I was so engrossed in winning,
why would I remember?

951
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,039
You are wrong to say this.

952
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:10,000
If you have asked
for blessings from the gods,

953
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:11,000
and broke your promise to thank them,

954
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:12,440
the gods will just ignore
your request for blessings in future.

955
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:14,199
The good brothers from the netherworld,
don't mess with them!

956
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,119
They will not let you off lightly.

957
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:18,039
Ever listened to
Taiwanese singer Tiger Huang's song?

958
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:19,639
What song?

959
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,199
It's not so simple!

960
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,119
They will come after you.

961
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,199
Or else you pass me some money,

962
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,199
I will help you buy and burn
the paper ingots for them now,

963
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,000
to settle this.

964
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,159
-Don't tell me you have spent it all?
-Not really.

965
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,000
I had $300,000 and I am left with...

966
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:46,159
-$30.
-$30? What did you spend it on?

967
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:48,039
You told me to go gamble.

968
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:51,000
I did tell you to have a game,
but not to bet in the thousands.

969
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:52,840
Just a few dollars would do.

970
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,039
You told me to visit the KTV lounge
and massage parlor and to get some girls.

971
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:59,519
I meant the KTV lounge for you to sing,
not to get girls.

972
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:00,599
And I mean just normal massage,

973
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,159
not to do a full package
of manicure and pedicure.

974
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,079
You even had your eyebrows trimmed!

975
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:06,079
You had no control over your tips,
and now you are putting the blame on me?

976
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,760
What can I do now?

977
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:13,360
I will not leave you in the lurch.

978
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,079
That's your promise.

979
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,000
Where are you going?

980
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:21,159
Do you remember
when we were at the columbarium,

981
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:22,119
there was this red packet on the floor,

982
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:24,400
I was against you taking it
but you refused to listen to me.

983
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,480
-Do you remember?
-What's your point?

984
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:29,599
The red packet belongs
to a girl named Xiao Juan.

985
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,079
She is very pitiful.
She died in her early 20s.

986
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:35,760
-She was still single then.
-How do you know?

987
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,039
Her ashes are placed at the columbarium.

988
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:39,199
It was her who
"loaned" you her good fortune

989
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,920
for you to strike the top two prizes.
You won't be so lucky without her.

990
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I see.

991
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:46,840
Can I burn the paper ingots
for her?

992
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,119
Do you think that will settle the problem?

993
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,239
Who wants your joss paper money?

994
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:52,239
Not after the ingots?

995
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,000
What is she after then?

996
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:01,719
You haven't told me what she wants.
What does she want?

997
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:04,360
I have already told you
she died young.

998
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,039
She is very lonesome down there.
She wants to find a husband.

999
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,639
She needs a man to marry?

1000
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:14,079
She is a ghost.
Who wants to marry a female ghost?

1001
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:16,599
-It's not so simple.
-Of course it's not so simple.

1002
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:18,000
That's why she searched
for such a long time.

1003
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,639
But all's well, she found him.

1004
01:03:19,719 --> 01:03:21,480
Really? Who is it? Where is he?

1005
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:24,039
He's right in front of us.

1006
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:25,119
You?

1007
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,800
You are sacrificing yourself for me?
I am really touched!

1008
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,280
She likes you!

1009
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:35,159
Me?

1010
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:38,960
You must be joking.

1011
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,039
Right?

1012
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:44,000
If you marry her,
she will ensure you strike it rich,

1013
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,039
do you dare?

1014
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,480
Why would I have the good fortune?

1015
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:51,760
By marrying her,
I will strike in everything,

1016
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:53,119
I am okay with it.

1017
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:56,599
You said it! You said okay!

1018
01:03:56,679 --> 01:03:57,719
Come!

1019
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:10,239
This is where Xiao Juan lives.
Her family is waiting for you now.

1020
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,079
Are you sure you want to go in?

1021
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:16,639
Are you sure if I go in,
I will strike it rich?

1022
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,280
-Confirmed?
-Confirmed.

1023
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:35,239
Come in.

1024
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:44,079
Are they Peranakans?

1025
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:48,119
No, they adore the Peranakan culture.
So they have designed their house as such.

1026
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:52,440
-No one is home?
-Hello.

1027
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:57,119
-They are Xiao Juan's parents.
-Uncle, Aunty.

1028
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:00,159
-Please have a seat.
-Sit down.

1029
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:06,480
So this is Hui?

1030
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,840
Yes.

1031
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:13,159
Xiao Juan is our youngest daughter.

1032
01:05:13,239 --> 01:05:16,000
We have always been worried
about her marriage.

1033
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:20,400
However, she was very insistent
on looking for her own partner.

1034
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:24,960
Unfortunately, she passed away
without finding the right one.

1035
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:29,000
She was only 22 when she died.

1036
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:34,280
-It's a pity to die at the age of 22!
-Don't spout nonsense!

1037
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:38,519
Who are they?

1038
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:40,519
I am her eldest sister.

1039
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:42,239
I am her second eldest sister.

1040
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:50,119
Her sisters are pretty.
They are prettier than my ex-girlfriend.

1041
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:55,039
Anyway, Xiao Juan has passed away,
I'll just choose one amongst them.

1042
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,400
Don't joke on this!

1043
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,840
He is the husband to my eldest daughter.
He is the husband to my second daughter.

1044
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:06,119
What a waste!

1045
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:15,000
Where is Xiao Juan?

1046
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:16,320
I would like to see her photograph.

1047
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:22,559
Photograph?

1048
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:28,039
He says he has not met you?

1049
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,119
Him?

1050
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,039
You are saying...

1051
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,039
Hai is Xiao Juan?

1052
01:06:41,239 --> 01:06:43,159
He is Xiao Juan?

1053
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:52,119
You must be joking!

1054
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:55,159
Hai, they say you are...

1055
01:06:58,039 --> 01:07:00,760
Where is Hai?

1056
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,639
Hui.

1057
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:34,159
When can we meet your family
to discuss your marriage with Xiao Juan?

1058
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,079
Wait.

1059
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,400
Are you saying I am marrying Hai?

1060
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:44,519
He is not Hai.
She is Xiao Juan.

1061
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:46,039
I am not homosexual.

1062
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:49,119
How can I marry a man?

1063
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:53,480
Who says she is a man?
She is a lovable lady.

1064
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,079
Dear.

1065
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,480
You are not Xiao Juan.

1066
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,000
You are Hai.

1067
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,679
You are a cross-dresser
with make-up and a wig!

1068
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,880
Don't play any pranks on me!

1069
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:13,760
I am not joking.

1070
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:15,639
Stop calling me a cross-dresser.

1071
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:23,880
Are you satisfied?
You have seen what you should.

1072
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,239
You have also seen what you shouldn't.
What more do you want?

1073
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,600
-It is awkward.
-You are pushing your luck.

1074
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:36,359
We are fated to be bonded in marriage.

1075
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:40,279
Why don't we do this?
I will marry one of your other daughters.

1076
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:43,760
I can be the second husband.
At least she is prettier.

1077
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:47,279
I know you detest my looks,

1078
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:50,279
but you must know this.

1079
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,039
In our love,

1080
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,119
I have never forced you into anything.

1081
01:08:57,039 --> 01:08:59,279
When we went to the columbarium
and saw the red packet,

1082
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:01,600
I advised you against
taking it, you told me...

1083
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,760
Picked it up.

1084
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,000
I told you not to open it,
you said...

1085
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:05,079
Opened it.

1086
01:09:05,159 --> 01:09:06,159
I warned you against wearing it,
you said...

1087
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,199
It's already on.

1088
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,920
Moreover, you repeatedly said...

1089
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,199
Fate.

1090
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:14,239
When you told me to eat shit...

1091
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:15,800
Go eat some shit!

1092
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,239
Do you know how glad I was?

1093
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:22,000
You said you were fated
to wear the bangle.

1094
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:23,159
It means you are fated to be with me.

1095
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:28,159
I have always believed in fate.

1096
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:32,079
When I realized I'd fallen for you,

1097
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:34,079
I "borrowed" luck for you
to win the lottery.

1098
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:37,079
Do you really think it was your
lucky stars at work to win the lottery?

1099
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:41,239
I am deeply in love with you now,

1100
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:45,159
and you are going to abandon me?

1101
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:47,159
How would I know you are so ugly?

1102
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:49,920
The girlfriends you dated
were getting uglier with time,

1103
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,079
and getting heavier in weight,

1104
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:54,000
I am good enough for your standards.

1105
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:56,119
If I had higher expectations,

1106
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:57,960
I would have looked for
Takeshi Kaneshiro or Tom Cruise.

1107
01:09:58,039 --> 01:09:59,039
You won't stand a chance!

1108
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:01,239
Treasure what you have now!

1109
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,399
You are not human, you are a ghost.

1110
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:08,039
Worse thing is you don't even look human
or even like a ghost!

1111
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:10,199
You are the ugliest ghost!

1112
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:12,159
Enough!

1113
01:10:37,159 --> 01:10:40,119
What is wrong with being a ghost?
We used to be humans, too.

1114
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:42,199
When humans pass away,
they become ghosts.

1115
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:46,000
If you are going to abandon Xiao Juan,
it will be an insult to her mother,

1116
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:47,239
I will turn you into a ghost!

1117
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,239
He does not want me!

1118
01:10:55,279 --> 01:11:00,199
No one wants me!

1119
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:09,119
He does not want me.

1120
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:19,119
The happiest moment for a woman is
when she puts on the wedding gown.

1121
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:22,239
Only when she has put on the gown,

1122
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:25,239
does she truly feel like a woman.

1123
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,199
Why won't you help me?

1124
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:32,000
What is ugliness?

1125
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,239
What is terrifying?

1126
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:42,359
This is ugly.

1127
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,920
This is terrifying.

1128
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:04,000
If you are not marrying me,

1129
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:07,159
it is the same as banishing me to hell!

1130
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:19,199
Only you can save me from hell!

1131
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:24,079
Or I will be trapped here forever!

1132
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:25,960
Look at my hair!

1133
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:29,560
Its growing longer and longer.

1134
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,079
Listen up!

1135
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:43,399
If Xiao Juan is trapped here...

1136
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:50,119
I will bring your family along
to roast together with us in underworld!

1137
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,000
How do I get in?

1138
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,560
With your heart.

1139
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:12,960
Come in.

1140
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:17,000
Come in.

1141
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,039
Come here.

1142
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,079
I know you love me.

1143
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,479
The fire has stopped burning.

1144
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:49,000
Hell is transforming to heaven.

1145
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:52,000
Are you marrying me?

1146
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,199
Is it really so painful to marry me?

1147
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:15,199
You are a ghost!

1148
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,119
Ungrateful man!

1149
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:20,199
Go to the underworld!

1150
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,359
There are a lot of men out there!

1151
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,479
Why me?

1152
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,000
Let me out!

1153
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:32,119
Let me out!

1154
01:14:41,239 --> 01:14:43,039
Fine!

1155
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:47,439
I will marry you!

1156
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,319
I will marry you!

1157
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:04,039
You let me out!

1158
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:06,920
I will marry you!

1159
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,119
I will marry you!

1160
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:26,279
I'm really down on my luck.

1161
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:29,119
I am going to marry
a cross-dressing ghost.

1162
01:15:42,279 --> 01:15:45,039
Hui, you are home.

1163
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:47,119
Have you eaten?

1164
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,159
Mother. Things are bad.

1165
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,279
What happened?

1166
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:55,399
I am going to get married soon.

1167
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,159
You?

1168
01:15:57,239 --> 01:15:59,000
Only a ghost will marry you.

1169
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:00,039
Right.

1170
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,119
I am marrying a ghost.

1171
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,279
Is it Caucasian, Chinese or Japanese?

1172
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:09,159
Please don't talk like that.
Don't spout nonsense!

1173
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:14,760
We did not install air conditioning,

1174
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:16,239
why do I feel cold?

1175
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:21,159
Aunty, I am Chen Xiao Juan.
Call me Juan.

1176
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,720
I truly like Hui.

1177
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:28,279
I hope you can give us your blessings
in the marriage.

1178
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:32,199
Who the heck is that?

1179
01:16:32,279 --> 01:16:35,119
Is it a female ghost
or a cross-dressing ghost?

1180
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,399
-Why is her voice so hoarse?
-Enough.

1181
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:41,159
Your son has nothing to his name.

1182
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:44,479
Still single at his age,
and he is going to die soon.

1183
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,199
We have no complaints about him.

1184
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:48,319
Sorry, sorry.

1185
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,920
If I marry her,
you will not hurt my mother and me, right?

1186
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,039
Fool.

1187
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:57,279
If you marry me,
I will be your wife.

1188
01:16:58,119 --> 01:17:00,159
Why would I harm you and your mother?

1189
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:04,439
Hui is my only son.

1190
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:09,279
If they are married,
then I won't have any grandchildren.

1191
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:11,199
Crazy!

1192
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,680
We are reasonable.

1193
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,600
If Hui can find a suitable partner,

1194
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,039
we will agree to his marriage.

1195
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,000
Really?

1196
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:27,439
However, Xiao Juan
must be his first wife in status.

1197
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,079
Mother-in-law,

1198
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:34,680
we will be family once they are married.

1199
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:36,319
Don't worry.

1200
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,640
You will have our blessings

1201
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:44,199
to strike in everything you bet on.

1202
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,439
Bet on any numbers,
and they will emerge as winning numbers.

1203
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,840
Really?

1204
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:57,039
Shall we just agree to it?

1205
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:07,199
Dear.

1206
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:09,119
Crazy!

1207
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:17,680
FAMILY PAPER INGOTS STORE

1208
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:33,359
Boss.

1209
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:36,079
How are you? Can I be of help?

1210
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,039
I am getting married.

1211
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:40,640
To a ghost?

1212
01:18:42,279 --> 01:18:44,239
Relax, you have come to the right place.

1213
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:45,680
We have everything here.

1214
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,000
Take your pick.

1215
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:48,199
Okay.

1216
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,720
Dear.

1217
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:53,039
I will check out the bungalows.

1218
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:54,560
Okay, this way please.

1219
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,560
I want this bungalow.

1220
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,279
It's freehold. High ceiling.
Three storeys high.

1221
01:19:02,359 --> 01:19:05,000
With a car and a bicycle as free gifts.
Plus two servants.

1222
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:07,039
And the male servant is handsome.

1223
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:09,680
Just one condition.

1224
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,720
Change the unit number to 0329.

1225
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:13,159
Tell her.

1226
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,079
-Tell her!
-Okay.

1227
01:19:18,439 --> 01:19:20,920
Miss, I want this bungalow.

1228
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:23,760
-Okay, no problem.
-I need to change the unit number.

1229
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,079
Sure, no problem.
What's your new number?

1230
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,119
-0329.
-Okay.

1231
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:29,920
Okay.

1232
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,079
Look at that bed.

1233
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,000
The spring mattress is really good.

1234
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,960
-I want this bed.
-Really?

1235
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,399
You can't sit if you are not a ghost.

1236
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:52,680
-You are right.
-Tell her I want this bed.

1237
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
-I want this bed.
-Okay, no problem.

1238
01:19:56,079 --> 01:19:57,960
I need a mobile phone, too, tell her.

1239
01:19:58,039 --> 01:20:00,199
-No.
-Yes, convenient for me to "SM."

1240
01:20:00,279 --> 01:20:03,680
I mean, send text messages
to you, tell her.

1241
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:07,359
Miss, do you sell mobile phones here?

1242
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:10,199
Mobile phones are outdated.
I have something else for you.

1243
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,119
-I want it.
-No.

1244
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:14,079
-I want it.
-Okay.

1245
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:15,159
This way, please.

1246
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:21,920
This is our latest product.

1247
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,560
-You have iPads here as well?
-It's called iPad here,

1248
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:29,520
-but it's called iOne down there.
-iOne.

1249
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:31,119
Will the system hang?

1250
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,359
Don't worry, our system will not hang.

1251
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:36,960
We use "My-ghost-soft" here.
The system will never hang.

1252
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:38,960
You can use one version
for ten thousand years.

1253
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:40,000
Ten thousand years.

1254
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:43,119
You are right, there's no need
for frequent upgrades, right?

1255
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,039
-I want three.
-No.

1256
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:46,560
-Three.
-No.

1257
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,680
Three.

1258
01:20:49,159 --> 01:20:51,000
We will give you a plane
when you buy three sets.

1259
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:53,119
A plane as a gift? Where do I fly to?

1260
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,600
The 18 levels in the underworld,
it's quite far.

1261
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,000
Hence, I am giving you two pilots.
Caucasian.

1262
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,840
What is that?

1263
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,000
Bling-bling!

1264
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:11,119
Diamonds!

1265
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,000
I want a diamond, too.

1266
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:18,520
I have an electric drill at home,
with a big stone.

1267
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:27,720
Why do you sell diamonds here?

1268
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,039
These diamonds are not ordinary ones.

1269
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:33,119
We created the diamonds
from human ashes or hair.

1270
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:36,520
You can pass it on as a family heirloom
or as a memento for your loved ones.

1271
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:41,560
New model!

1272
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,359
I am going bankrupt.

1273
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:52,039
E200?

1274
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:56,560
Ask if they have E500?
I want ten if they do.

1275
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,960
Negative.

1276
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:01,479
You did not even ask.

1277
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,960
-Do you have E500?
-Yes.

1278
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:09,479
E500.

1279
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,560
Just like this?

1280
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:16,479
You are so nice to me.

1281
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:18,199
I feel like kissing you now.

1282
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,840
Let's go home to kiss.
There are people around.

1283
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,600
They can't see me, kiss me!

1284
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,039
-No.
-Come on.

1285
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:27,000
-No.
-Do it!

1286
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:30,199
-No!
-Don't move!

1287
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:31,600
Mouth in position!

1288
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,119
-No!
-Do it!

1289
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:35,079
More.

1290
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:36,840
Can you do it willingly?

1291
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:40,039
You are so cute.

1292
01:22:51,319 --> 01:22:53,159
HAPPILY MARRIED

1293
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:00,640
MAKE A FORTUNE

1294
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,079
Bow to Heaven and Earth.

1295
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:08,159
Bow.

1296
01:23:10,279 --> 01:23:13,039
Bow to the parents.

1297
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,079
Bow.

1298
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,159
Couple, bow to each other.

1299
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:23,239
Bow.

1300
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:29,119
To the bridal room.

1301
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:33,520
Serving tea to the groom's mother.

1302
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,239
Serving tea to the bride's parents.

1303
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:28,239
Dear.

1304
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,119
Time is precious tonight.
Let's not waste it.

1305
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:35,039
I have to leave at 6:00 a.m.

1306
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,560
Quick.

1307
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:45,399
Come.

1308
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,199
Shall we start?

1309
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,079
You remind me of Hai.

1310
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,000
I can't concentrate.

1311
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:05,920
Okay, since this is our first night,
I can transform myself.

1312
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,239
Who do you want me to transform to?

1313
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,800
I like Japanese films.

1314
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:16,279
Just say pornography.
What Japanese films? Who do you want?

1315
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:18,159
Just name her.

1316
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,159
And just for tonight.

1317
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:37,399
How are you tonight? I am Chen Xiao Juan.

1318
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,560
You can start now.

1319
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:42,119
Can you change your voice, too?

1320
01:25:42,199 --> 01:25:43,159
Don't push it.

1321
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:06,079
Crazy. Darn unlucky!

1322
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,119
Don't drive if you don't know how to.

1323
01:27:13,159 --> 01:27:14,119
Why is there a crowd?

1324
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,000
Dear.

1325
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:07,760
Don't call me that.

1326
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,680
You promised not to harm me.

1327
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:13,479
If you marry me,
I will be your wife.

1328
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,880
Why would I harm you and your mother?

1329
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:20,279
You are extremely naive
to believe what a ghost said.

1330
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:23,479
-You...
-Enough said.

1331
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:26,000
The joss paper warehouse is having
a Great Singapore Sale.

1332
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:28,199
-Let's go.
-What about my body?

1333
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:33,520
-Leave it to the police.
-My face is stained with blood.

1334
01:28:34,119 --> 01:28:35,000
Don't worry.

1335
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:37,600
Ang Chin Moh Casket
will help to beautify your face.

1336
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,680
Let's go.

1337
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:42,880
Come on!

1338
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:17,960
IF YOU CHOOSE TO ASSOCIATE YOURSELF
WITH THE DEVIL,

1339
01:29:18,039 --> 01:29:23,039
BE PREPARED TO PAY A HEFTY PRICE.

1340
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:42,600
So if you think there are ghosts,
there are ghosts. If you...

1341
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:47,159
Sorry, if you think no ghosts,
then no ghosts, right? Sorry.

1342
01:29:47,239 --> 01:29:48,560
I understand.

1343
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,560
A ghost might jump out
and cut off your ears. Understand?

1344
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,640
You better watch...

1345
01:29:56,119 --> 01:29:59,279
When you're walking along
and there's someone behind...

1346
01:30:00,439 --> 01:30:01,800
I said there's electricity...

1347
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,319
Should be no electricity

1348
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:07,680
-F...
-No profanity, sir.

1349
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,880
Chicken pie! That's vulgar.

1350
01:30:10,039 --> 01:30:11,880
"Is that vulgar?"

1351
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:16,600
He even used a prop.
What about you? Focus!

1352
01:30:17,319 --> 01:30:19,079
I tell you...

1353
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,319
I think I saw someone much better than me.

1354
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,840
Our government asks us to speak Mandarin.
It's the right thing to do!

1355
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,720
There's no need to find someone better.

1356
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,840
I should really think about it.

1357
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,720
I'll wear our national emblem.
We can learn Mandarin together!

1358
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:41,600
Both of you go and clean the bloody store!

1359
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,600
Before you check out.

1360
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:49,079
Before you're both gone.

1361
01:30:49,239 --> 01:30:54,720
Encik, I think it's better
to tell the CO...

1362
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:02,279
Tell the CO... Cancerous...

1363
01:31:02,439 --> 01:31:06,359
-Tell the CO... Cancer...
-Excellent!

1364
01:31:12,279 --> 01:31:13,960
Oh, my mama!

1365
01:31:14,119 --> 01:31:16,520
You're right! Lucky hand.

1366
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,960
You stay here and watch me win, okay?

1367
01:31:23,079 --> 01:31:25,800
Cut! What is "lucky hand"?

1368
01:31:26,199 --> 01:31:30,000
-No one's home.
-Hello.

1369
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:34,159
They're Xiao Juan's parents.
Tell them to adjust the watch...

1370
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,039
The clock.

1371
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:37,520
Coming... Coming...

1372
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,640
You son of a bitch! How dare you
fool around with him behind my back?

1373
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:41,920
You son of a bitch!

1374
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,560
You whore! How dare you
fool around with man behind my back?

1375
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,279
You son of a bitch! Fooling around
with him behind my back!

1376
01:31:47,479 --> 01:31:51,239
You son of a bitch! Fooling around with...

1377
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:53,920
It's not the length. It's not the size.

1378
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:58,520
I'm shorter!

1379
01:31:59,239 --> 01:32:03,279
I'm uglier! I'm older!

1380
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:07,439
Cut the crap about how I'm the moon
and you're my sunshine.

1381
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,119
Stop saying that you're my bra
and I'm your briefs

1382
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:12,000
and that you can't get dressed without me!

1383
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:15,039
How about that?

1384
01:32:16,039 --> 01:32:18,720
I genuinely like Brother Hui.

1385
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,800
Brother Hui.

1386
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,680
Ah Hui. Brother Hui.

1387
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:23,920
You have iPads here as well?

1388
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,039
-Yes.
-At home?

1389
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:26,359
Here.

1390
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,800
You said you have an iPad at home.

1391
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,479
-Here.
-No. Do you want to go there...

1392
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,119
-Negative.
-You did not even ask.

1393
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:36,039
You did not even ask.

1394
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,479
-Do you have E500?
-Yes.

1395
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:46,359
You are the ugliest ghost!

1396
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,279
Cut!

1397
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,000
You're so stupid. Who is uglier?

1398
01:32:55,119 --> 01:32:56,279
Take a break.
