&lrm;No, no negative emotions.

&lrm;I'm sure she likes you too.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.660
&lrm;[whispering] Go talk to her.

&lrm;I'm no good with words.

&lrm;Who needs words?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.940
&lrm;You could draw her a picture,
&lrm;send her flowers...

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.020
&lrm;I could write her a song?

&lrm;That's a great idea.

&lrm;Can I have an autograph? I'm a huge fan.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.500
&lrm;This is your seat, Adrikins.
&lrm;I saved it for you,

&lrm;The brats who sat here yesterday
&lrm;need some attitude adjustment.

&lrm;I'm just commanding
&lrm;a bit of respect, that's all.

&lrm;Think that's really necessary?

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.140
&lrm;You've got a lot to learn
&lrm;about school culture, Adrikins.

&lrm;Watch the master.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.420
&lrm;Alya, wouldn't you like to be a superhero

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.900
&lrm;and fight monsters and villains?

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.740
&lrm;Totally. I'm not scared of anyone. Why?

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.900
&lrm;No reason.

&lrm;You're friends with Chloe, right?

&lrm;Why do people keep saying that?

&lrm;See what I mean about respect?

&lrm;Please, my hair.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.220
&lrm;[Mylene] Put us down, Ivan.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.580
&lrm;Let's follow him.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.220
&lrm;Oh no, you go.
&lrm;I'm finding a place to hide.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.740
&lrm;You're gonna miss Ladybug in action.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.620
&lrm;You and Ladybug will be
&lrm;better off without me.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.180
&lrm;If you say so.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.620
&lrm;Wait, your bag.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.500
&lrm;My first day and I didn't
&lrm;make it past roll call.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.140
&lrm;A day off? I like the sound of that.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.580
&lrm;No, no. We've got homework to do.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.940
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.420
&lrm;You've no idea who you're dealing with.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.220
&lrm;My daddy, the mayor, will bring in
&lrm;the army and the entire cavalry.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.780
&lrm;Don't forget the superheroes!

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.940
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Oh no, my bad.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.780
&lrm;Super-incompetent, you mean.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.620
&lrm;You wanted the cavalry?

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.060
&lrm;Here it is!

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.060
&lrm;[Mylene] No!

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.380
&lrm;Seize him!

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.500
&lrm;[Mylene] Watch out!

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.860
&lrm;[Mylene] Ivan,

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.060
&lrm;where are we going?

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.020
&lrm;To deliver a message.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.180
&lrm;We'll be brought together forever.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.700
&lrm;This lovey-dovey stuff makes me sick.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.300
&lrm;Don't worry, little monster,
&lrm;I'll take care of you too.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.740
&lrm;Ladybug,

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.300
&lrm;I need help.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.540
&lrm;What's she waiting for?

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.220
&lrm;[Alya screams]

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.980
&lrm;Let go, you rock-head!

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.660
&lrm;Help!

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.900
&lrm;-I need Ladybug.
&lrm;-I knew you'd come around.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.100
&lrm;I'm still not sure I'm up for this

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.500
&lrm;but Alya's in danger.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.060
&lrm;I can't do nothing.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.420
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.060
&lrm;You can't stay here. It's too dangerous.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.340
&lrm;Cat Noir, extend it!

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.100
&lrm;[Ladybug] Sorry I was late.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.380
&lrm;Have I ever told you
&lrm;you turn my world upside down?

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.380
&lrm;You're quite a joker.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.660
&lrm;But your timing needs work.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.980
&lrm;We gotta go.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.700
&lrm;Aren't we gonna take care of them?

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.340
&lrm;No, if we want to save them all
&lrm;then we go to the source...

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.900
&lrm;that one.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.540
&lrm;I demand my daughter's safe return.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.660
&lrm;Daddy!

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.740
&lrm;You're welcome to her!

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.380
&lrm;[she screams]

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.580
&lrm;I promise to be nice, be polite and...

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.860
&lrm;-I didn't promise.
&lrm;-What?

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.740
&lrm;My little princess.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.460
&lrm;We're clear to attack!

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.180
&lrm;Wait, don't attack. You'll make it worse.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.740
&lrm;I've a new plan.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.780
&lrm;Leave it to the pros.
&lrm;You already failed once.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.100
&lrm;He's right.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.540
&lrm;Had I captured the Akuma the 1st time,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.980
&lrm;this wouldn't have happened.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.100
&lrm;I knew I wasn't the one for this job.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
&lrm;No. He's wrong.
&lrm;Without you, she wouldn't be here.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.380
&lrm;Without us, they won't make it.
&lrm;We'll prove it.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.740
&lrm;Trust me on this, OK?

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.980
&lrm;OK.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.660
&lrm;[roaring]

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.260
&lrm;[coughing and spluttering]

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.500
&lrm;[weak groan]

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.500
&lrm;People of Paris,

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.900
&lrm;listen carefully...

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.740
&lrm;I am Hawk Moth.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.700
&lrm;Hawk moth?

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.780
&lrm;[evil voice] Ladybug, Cat Noir,

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.020
<i>&lrm;give me</i>

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.780
<i>&lrm;the Ladybug earrings and the cat ring now!</i>

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.620
&lrm;You've done enough damage
&lrm;to these innocent people.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.260
&lrm;Nice try, but we know who the bad guy is.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.260
&lrm;Let's not reverse the roles.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.420
&lrm;You turned these
&lrm;innocent victims into villains.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.860
&lrm;Hawk Moth, no matter how long it takes,

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.420
&lrm;we will find you

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.940
&lrm;and you'll hand us your Miraculous!

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.700
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.020
&lrm;[Hawk Moth groans]

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.340
&lrm;[Ladybug yells]

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.940
&lrm;Let me make this promise.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.620
&lrm;Whoever wants to harm you,

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.780
&lrm;Cat Noir and I will do
&lrm;all we can to keep you safe.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.300
&lrm;Yes!

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.500
&lrm;Whoever she is beneath that mask

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.900
&lrm;I love that girl.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.540
&lrm;That's the problem with superheroes,
&lrm;they're too... heroic!

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.060
&lrm;Stoneheart, they're trying to take
&lrm;your loved one away.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.580
&lrm;Snatch their Miraculouses,
&lrm;they'll be powerless against you.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.380
&lrm;OK, Hawk Moth.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.300
&lrm;[Mylene] Help me!

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.500
&lrm;You'll never take Mylene from me!

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.780
&lrm;[Stoneheart] Come to me, my Stonebeings!

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.700
&lrm;We're surrounded.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.540
&lrm;What now? We can't attack him.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.700
&lrm;But we know where the Akuma is.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.700
&lrm;[Cat Noir] In the fist he's got Mylene in.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.500
&lrm;So, he's in love with her...

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.740
&lrm;That's it!

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.260
&lrm;We don't separate them,
&lrm;we bring them closer together.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.340
&lrm;They're made each other,
&lrm;they just don't know it.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.380
&lrm;I don't get it,
&lrm;but I guess I better trust you.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.660
&lrm;Something tells me
&lrm;this is how it'll be in future.

&lrm;[helicopters hum]

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.540
&lrm;Help! I'm scared of heights!

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.180
&lrm;It'll be alright!

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.580
&lrm;[Stoneheart roars]

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.780
&lrm;How will you get them even closer?

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.540
&lrm;By using our powers!

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.140
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.340
&lrm;A parachute?
&lrm;What do I do with this?

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.740
&lrm;[Cat Noir yells]

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.860
&lrm;You know what you're doing?

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.700
&lrm;We'll find out soon enough.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.940
&lrm;His hand... get ready!

&lrm;Home run!

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.620
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.180
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

&lrm;[sigh of relief]

&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.540
&lrm;[Cat noir amazed] Are you seeing this?

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.940
&lrm;Yeah, it's beautiful and amazing, it's...

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.780
&lrm;miraculous!

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.380
&lrm;This is just the beginning, Ladybug.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.380
&lrm;You may have won this battle

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.340
&lrm;but I will win the war!

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.500
&lrm;I will get your Miraculouses,
&lrm;I will get the absolute power,

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.460
&lrm;and then, my secret dream will come true!

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.700
&lrm;I think you two need to talk.

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.540
&lrm;I...I...

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.540
&lrm;It may help if you read
&lrm;the lyrics to Ivan's song.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.180
&lrm;It's beautiful.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.300
&lrm;It's a shame you can't hear them
&lrm;when you scream...

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.540
&lrm;I mean sing.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.660
&lrm;It was scary, wasn't it?
&lrm;Is that why you left?

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.340
&lrm;I'm sorry. I'll be gentle.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.100
&lrm;They're made for each other.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.340
&lrm;Like us two.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.740
&lrm;[bleeping] See that?

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.220
&lrm;Time to split. See you soon, Cat Noir.

&lrm;Can't wait, Milady.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.060
&lrm;By the time I biked to the Eiffel Tower,

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.180
&lrm;it was all over. I'm way bummed.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.780
&lrm;You'll get your scoop eventually.

<i>&lrm;You'll continue music, Chinese,</i>
<i>&lrm;fencing and your photo shoots.</i>

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.220
&lrm;Thank you, Nathalie,
&lrm;Thank you, father.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.420
&lrm;No, wait.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.620
&lrm;[Chloe] You're in

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.780
&lrm;the wrong seat.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.020
&lrm;Go on, get lost.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.340
&lrm;All that's necessary
&lrm;for the triumph of evil

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.180
&lrm;is that good people do nothing.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.980
&lrm;What's that supposed to mean?

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.340
&lrm;It means I'm not putting up
&lrm;with your crud anymore,

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.020
&lrm;neither is anyone else.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.820
&lrm;So take your attitude and go and get lost.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.620
&lrm;[laughing]

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.220
&lrm;Good job.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.420
&lrm;You wanna make friends, right?

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.500
&lrm;Talk to Marinette about the gum.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.780
&lrm;What should I say?

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.420
&lrm;Just be yourself.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.060
&lrm;Hey.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.140
&lrm;[she huffs]

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.940
&lrm;I just want you to know

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.220
&lrm;I was only trying to get the gum off,

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.220
&lrm;I swear.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.740
&lrm;I've never been to school before.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.380
&lrm;I've never had friends.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.660
&lrm;It's all sort of new to me.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:03.180
&lrm;[romantic music]

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.060
&lrm;[thunder rumbles]

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:11.900
&lrm;[romantic music]

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.180
&lrm;See you tomorrow.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.020
&lrm;[romantic music]

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.540
&lrm;[stammering] See you tomorrow...

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.700
&lrm;[chuckling] Why am I stammering?

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.220
&lrm;Hey. I think I might have an idea.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.780
&lrm;First day of school
&lrm;and we already have two love-birds.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.060
&lrm;[puffing] Whatever, she's just a friend.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.380
&lrm;A friend.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:49.100
&lrm;[romantic music]

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.620
&lrm;[Waizze] Excellent choice, master.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.340
&lrm;Those two are made for each other.
