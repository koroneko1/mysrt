00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.540
Hey, why are you so sad that seem like a dumpling in the afternoon?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.860
How can I be happy? My angel has got a boyfriend already.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.300
What? How can you know it?

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.100
Yesterday, I saw...

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.320
Introduce to Khoi, this is Thao's boyfriend.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.200
A girl who goes out at this time, needs to take her boyfriend along.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.480
Is it right, Oppa?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.800
It's because of you, you message to me all day. It's annoying.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.680
So I let my boyfriend here today to tell you that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.200
I has got a boyfriend already

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.080
And do you know who her lover is?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.560
Who?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.580
The guy in music club - Lam

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.620
Lam?

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.340
I think... It's not like what you think

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.400
Why not? It's all clear.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.400
Dang...

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.940
Your debt department is coming, wish you survive

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.060
Do you know what the date today is?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.460
Today is Tuesday?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.460
Who don't know today is Tuesday? We are going to the cinema tonight.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.580
Do you forget it?

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.660
No, I don't.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.260
But if I forget it, you will remind me, for sure.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.140
So let's watch a movie tonight.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.340
Uh uh. But now I have to come back my class, I haven't written the lessons.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.140
Ah, I buy you this one.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.180
Uh, thank you.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.700

Let me hold them | Thank you so much.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.460
You're welcome

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.660

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.380
Cuz I had seen you there for sometimes.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.940
How about you? What's you name? Which class are you in?

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.620
I'm Minh Lam, 11D

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.180

Alright, let's back to class

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.820
Damn it... Maybe I need to hit him.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.780
Yesterday, he was the boyfriend of my angel

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.940
But today he flirts another girl.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.220
Calm down. Everything will be ok

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.100
I will follow this thing.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.100
Hey, guy

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.140
What did you say?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.180
Hey...

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.040
Quan, next time, you should put down half of a tone at this dialogue

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.220
Ok everyone, it's all today

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.460
Ok, I have some sudden works, I go first

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.340
Remember to close the club's  door for me.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.540
You are going to have a meeting with us, Dung

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.700
Hey, hey... What kind of your riding?

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.380
Hello boy, where do you still go this time?

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.340
Wherever I go, it's not your turn to care.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.860
But seem like... you are perverted, right?

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.580
Every time I go out, you all appear here. Why?

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.980
You seem very like reading novels, right? Too imaginative!

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.000
Ah, but a young boy need to go to bed early.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
Why do you keep calling me as "boy"? As if you was very older than me...

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.100
Well... I go... dating

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.260

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.340

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.420
Later, happy dating.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.660
Teacher... Eating can also be called as fining?

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.060
Well, you go to have dinner with me, don't let me go alone, it's also a favor.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.180
Let's eat this one, it's too delicious

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.860
You eat first...

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.860
Relax...

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.200
I'm only like your brother

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.080
See me as your brother, eat it.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.740
I'm sorry, I have a phone call

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.620
Alo, what's up?

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.860
Where are you now?

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.580
I... I'm sorry

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.660
I have a sudden work, I forget it.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.620
I'm sorry, sorry too much

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.580
What is sorry? I'm at the theater now.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.980
And I need to come back?

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.660
Gosh!

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.820
I'm busy and forget it.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.940
I will pay your ticket next time

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.940
If you said that you would paid my ticket, it's would be easy to hear.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.420
Hey, don't fish in the troubled water!

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.820
It's ok, I will block you on facebook,

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.220
We are no longer friends together.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.500
Like a kid... ok ok

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.060
I'm wrong, I'm stupid, and I need to bear.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.740
Keep seeing, I will pay you back tomorrow.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.060
By the way, please pay me the popcorn and drink

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.340
The more you have the more you want?

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.280
I need to say that

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.780
First case is you don't accepts, you won't get anything

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.540
Or else, I will pay your ticket

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.140
Choose it!

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.880
If not, it's up to you. Why soo serious?

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.920
Ok, bye | Ok, that's all

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.820
I will pay all the left part after acting

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.620
I will do what I say

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.140
You are too brave not like your appearance

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.920
They are the people who make the event first

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.920
But what is the interesting in hitting together?

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.220
We need to do that, therefore they won't slight our troupe

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.340
Hello boy...

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.460
What a extremely cold cinema!

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.140
The chair is too small too...

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.300
If I knew, I would buy the couple position instead.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.980
Hey, if you want, go and buy yourself

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.820
You have money for seeing the movie, why don't you know how to buy it?

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.140
It's mine

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.400
But... This's called as "dating"?

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.560
Dating with the loneliness

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.200
Leave me alone, I go with the air, ok?

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.140
Honey, do you wanna eat? no? So I will eat
