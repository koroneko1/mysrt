1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,280
Welcome, everyone, to our Music Club.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,200
This year is so special.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,760
We have a legend here with us.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,720
People call her the legendary electric guitarist.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,320
She's joining us today.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,880
Let's meet her, guys.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,000
MUSIC CLUB

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,240
Why is no one attending?

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,360
-Who is she? -Jennie.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,720
The legendary electric guitarist.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,040
She's from the Hot Wave Contest the same year as Toon.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,800
-Toon Bodyslam, you know. -Come on, Dim.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,000
Not just Toon, I just dined with Ohm from Cocktail yesterday.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,080
-How was it? -I paid for dinner.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,080
Let's focus on the present.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm a fan of you two. I press "like" on every post of yours.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,960
By the way, did you guys dance to the Spider song?

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,640
Yes?

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,040
That's all right.

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,200
Let's skip to the highlight.

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,840
The snack-feeding game.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,040
Let's do it.

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,480
-Jennie, the thing is… -What?

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
The university bans such games.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,280
What? Why is it like this?

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,920
Who bans them?

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,640
I can't believe it.

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,600
I took a day off just to see you guys play this game.

29
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,280
Can't you just proceed with it? I will take full responsibility.

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,400
We can't. If these juniors report it to the board,

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,880
our club could get shut down.

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,200
All right. Let's do this, then.

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,360
You juniors don't need to do anything.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,680
Wat and Tine will be the ones playing the snack game.

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,400
Just the two of them.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,720
Give it up for them.

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,560
Sarawat and Tine will play.

38
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,000
They will feed snacks to each other. Give me some music.

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,160
Here we go! Feed the snack.

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
Snack.

41
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,840
WatTine! Everyone, together.

42
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,160
WatTine!

43
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,080
That's right.

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,320
This game will live on forever.

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,840
Who will be the feeder?

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,200
Wat? Tine?

47
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,800
-I will. -Good.

48
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,440
Just stand still. Let me handle it.

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,040
Goodness.

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,280
Oh, my heart can't take it. He said he'd handle it.

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,840
"Let me handle it."

52
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,120
Drumroll, please.

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,360
A bit closer.

54
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,920
A little bit closer.

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,960
A professor's here.

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,200
Everybody knows it. My fans know it.

57
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,400
I live my life just to see their moments.

58
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm dying happily.

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,720
What did you just do?

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,880
A professor was passing by. I had to destroy the evidence.

61
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,160
You're my secretary. A little kiss from me won't hurt.

62
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,280
Jennie, you're heavy.

63
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,880
What should I get Tine for his birthday?

64
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,120
I want something…

65
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,600
simple…

66
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,560
yet special.

67
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,720
How about you turn a university hall into a surprise party?

68
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,640
Don't you get what "simple" means?

69
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,800
I just don't know what he likes.

70
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,840
-I can't figure it out. -He likes you.

71
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,720
I know that. He likes me. He likes me very much. But…

72
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,640
How about you tie yourself with a ribbon? It'll be a surprise.

73
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,280
-Good. -Right?

74
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,680
I'm being serious here.

75
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,280
What's the color of the ribbon?

76
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,440
-Pink. -Pink.

77
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,720
I can't stand you guys anymore.

78
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,960
You guys aren't kids.

79
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,160
Such crappy ideas.

80
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,480
Here we go.

81
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,920
Do you have a better idea?

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,840
Sing him Scrubb songs.

83
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,680
Scrubb again?

84
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,880
Will you ever let my friend move on from this band?

85
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,640
But Tine really loves their songs.

86
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,960
Go on.

87
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,440
Throw him a Scrubb music festival of your own.

88
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,200
Play him a song every night until his birthday.

89
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,840
This way, he'll know you're paying attention to him.

90
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,440
Put your heart into it.

91
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
Fong the Philosopher strikes again.

92
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,880
I think it's his fling.

93
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,640
Good morning.

94
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,480
I've looked into your latest marketing analysis.

95
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,320
Well…

96
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,240
It's so good.

97
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,800
Management loves it.

98
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you.

99
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,000
One more thing. There's good news for you.

100
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,640
Our company is looking for a new marketing team leader.

101
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,120
Would a hardworking young man like you be interested, Type?

102
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,280
I'm interested.

103
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,040
But you'll be sitting in the Phuket office.

104
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,640
Oh.

105
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,120
-Phuket? -Yes.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,800
I know it's far,

107
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,600
but this is a good opportunity for you.

108
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,320
All right. Just think about it.

109
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,120
When you make up your mind, just let me know. Okay?

110
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,480
Sure.

111
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,280
"Together," "The Sun," and "Eternal Love."

112
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,000
He'll love it.

113
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,280
Hey.

114
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,480
What happened?

115
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,680
You seem cranky.

116
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,000
I just got back from the hospital.

117
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,160
The cheerleading team had a car accident.

118
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,440
What?

119
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,520
Fang.

120
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,640
I heard your car overturned.

121
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,520
I thought you were badly injured.

122
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,280
I'm glad you're all right.

123
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,640
Come on. I have a ruptured tendon.

124
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
Doesn't it sound serious to you?

125
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,520
A ruptured tendon?

126
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,440
-What about the others? -Over there.

127
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,080
I'm okay.

128
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,760
Oh…

129
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
Damn.

130
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,640
As you can see.

131
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,800
I've told you many times to drive carefully. You never listened.

132
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,040
It hurts.

133
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,080
Right.

134
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,400
What about our cheerleading club?

135
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
What should we do?

136
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,200
That's why I called you.

137
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,360
We're about to hit the audition day.

138
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,080
And the person I trust the most with this job is you, Tine.

139
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,160
Tine.

140
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,720
Be the club president for me, please.

141
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Please.

142
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,880
I told her I'd like to be your secretary,

143
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,680
but she wanted me to think it over.

144
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,320
You don't have to.

145
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,600
Just be the club president.

146
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,080
Wait. Why so easy?

147
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,080
Then don't. Be my secretary.

148
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,440
What? You're confusing me.

149
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,280
No, you're confusing me. I found an easy way out for you.

150
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,720
What do you say?

151
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,960
I've been practicing the guitar so hard

152
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,280
because I want to work with you.

153
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,040
I know.

154
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,720
I don't want to let you go,

155
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,200
but what else can I do?

156
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,440
My boyfriend is smart,

157
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,400
responsible,

158
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,760
hardworking, and good-looking.

159
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,480
Everyone wants to have him.

160
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,920
You spoil me.

161
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,200
You're my boyfriend after all.

162
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,400
It's my duty to spoil you.

163
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,800
You're very sweet.

164
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,280
Should I reward you?

165
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,800
Hey.

166
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,360
What song do you like?

167
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,920
I'll play it for you.

168
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Damn.

169
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
You just ruined the mood.

170
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,600
How was your day, darling?

171
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,920
Stop with these sweet words.

172
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,960
Are you online shopping again?

173
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,280
What are you talking about? Don't accuse me.

174
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,880
You're wrong.

175
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,720
You always forget to log out of your e-mail. I see everything.

176
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,960
Oops.

177
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,320
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

178
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,320
Please don't be mad.

179
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,440
Okay?

180
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,960
Okay. I won't be.

181
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,400
It's no big deal.

182
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,680
I'm taking a shower.

183
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,200
What?

184
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Our company is looking for a new marketing team leader.

185
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,320
But you'll be sitting in the Phuket office.

186
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,960
-I'll scrub your back. -Hey.

187
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,360
What are you doing?

188
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,320
I'm taking a shower with you so you won't be lonely.

189
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,960
Let me scrub your back.

190
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,720
Do it gently, then.

191
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,240
I'm always gentle with you.

192
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,160
Let me.

193
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,040
If Tine's skin is super bright,

194
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
then yours should be duper bright.

195
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,320
-Hey. -Type.

196
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,080
Will you tell me what's going on?

197
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,080
Do you think I can't tell?

198
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,360
You're overthinking. I'm all right. Just a bit tired.

199
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,880
Go on. Scrub my back.

200
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Are you sure?

201
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,280
I am.

202
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Hey.

203
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,960
Are you going to stir until it evaporates?

204
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,840
No, I'm not.

205
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,000
You're zoning out.

206
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,720
What's on your mind?

207
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,200
Today is the kick-off day for the Cheerleading Club.

208
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,040
I'm nervous.

209
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,840
This is the first time I'm doing things without you by my side.

210
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,760
Get your head closer.

211
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,880
What?

212
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,160
Come closer.

213
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,840
Why?

214
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,400
Get closer to me.

215
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,400
Dear God.

216
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,760
I wish my boy all the best in work,

217
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,240
that he's loved by many people,

218
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,400
and that he's respected by his club members.

219
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,160
So be it.

220
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,120
Wow.

221
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,320
Your skin is so soft.

222
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,680
Wait.

223
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,520
You didn't make one for me.

224
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,520
Right.

225
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,280
Come on.

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,040
What happened to your generosity?

227
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,720
It's gone. You don't have it anymore.

228
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
Quit complaining.

229
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,800
Do I look good enough?

230
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,200
Do I look trustworthy?

231
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,640
You look great. Come on.

232
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,200
I'm here, Fang.

233
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,600
See you later at home.

234
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,200
What? We got a club room?

235
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,880
Yes. I'm on the fourth floor. Which room?

236
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,800
Okay.

237
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,520
Sure. I'm about to get there.

238
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
I found it.

239
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,280
-The door isn't locked, right? -Hey.

240
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,200
What?

241
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,480
I thought your club was far away,

242
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,720
but you're just next door. That's good.

243
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,200
Are you sure it's good?

244
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,800
What are you doing, Boss?

245
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,160
Liking Pear's photos.

246
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,800
I see.

247
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,160
I know that. You've been liking hundreds of her photos already.

248
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,920
What's wrong with that?

249
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,880
I'm doing it until I hit her first post,

250
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,720
so that she knows I like her.

251
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,080
Master Nicky taught me this trick.

252
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,320
Master Nicky?

253
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,600
-That's right. -What crap.

254
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,760
How so?

255
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,160
Take Phukong for example. He's writing a song for the one he likes.

256
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,880
You should be ashamed.

257
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,080
All you do is check out her photos.

258
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
Do you think it works?

259
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,480
Dumbass.

260
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,480
Say whatever you want. You have a boyfriend.

261
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,080
Of course I do.

262
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
-Look, dude. -What is it?

263
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,120
It's Phukong.

264
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
-Hello, Pear. -Damn.

265
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,240
-Where's the phone? -Oh.

266
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,280
-Is this the one? -Yes, it is.

267
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,880
Hold on.

268
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,440
Don't tell me the senior he likes is Pear.

269
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,760
Right.

270
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,800
They're saying goodbye.

271
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,240
Boss, you brat.

272
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,040
-Boss, calm down. -Don't hold me back.

273
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,400
-Oh, hello. -How about you go to hell?

274
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,640
-What does it mean? -No idea. I heard it in Korean dramas.

275
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,880
Calm down, man. Keep it cool.

276
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,280
Phukong.

277
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,520
Wat told us you had a crush on a senior.

278
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,000
We didn't think it would be this person.

279
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
You guys knew?

280
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,600
Come on.

281
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,160
It's so obvious. You two are really close. There are millions of people out there.

282
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,520
-Why are you hitting on Boss's sweetheart? -What?

283
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,560
-That's right. -Do you like Mil?

284
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,200
Of course I do. Her skin is so bright. How can…

285
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,400
Did you just say Mil?

286
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,120
You like Mil?

287
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,200
Well, the thing is,

288
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,840
Pear's little brother is studying architecture.

289
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,960
Her brother and I are close friends,

290
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,240
but the one I really like is Mil.

291
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,920
Don't worry.

292
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
We live in a modern world where love knows no boundaries.

293
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,080
I don't care about that at all. I'm worried about my brother.

294
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,120
Wat and Mil don't like each other.

295
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,240
Oh.

296
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,200
-Well, guys… -What?

297
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,360
Please don't tell Wat.

298
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,520
I won't.

299
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,080
By the way, which level are you on with Mil?

300
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Level? I'm stuck right where I started.

301
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,760
Poor you.

302
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,200
He knows how I feel,

303
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,760
but he regards me as a younger brother.

304
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,400
All he does is ask me to play football with him.

305
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,320
There, there.

306
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,880
You're in the brother zone. It's fine.

307
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,080
Been there, done that. I understand.

308
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,840
We're going to help you.

309
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,040
That's right.

310
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,520
I helped your brother once.

311
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,640
I'm sure I can make it happen for you.

312
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,240
Really?

313
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,920
Of course. Rest assured.

314
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,240
Just smile and things will be fine.

315
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,560
Don't worry, kid.

316
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,160
-You sure you don't like Pear that way? -I'm sure.

317
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,840
-You can hit on her. -Good.

318
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,560
Now you don't have to worry.

319
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,720
APPLY FOR CHEERLEADING CLUB

320
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,320
We've come to the last member.

321
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,120
Palm, would you mind telling us why you want to be a cheerleader?

322
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,360
I was a cheerleader before in high school,

323
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,960
and I want to carry on the job here as well.

324
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,960
I'm Tine, the Cheerleading Club president.

325
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,080
Thank you all for your interest in joining our club.

326
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,680
We will have an audition coming in a week,

327
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,120
so I'd like to know if any of you was a cheerleader before.

328
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,480
Oh.

329
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,800
Sorry to interrupt.

330
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Get out.

331
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,280
There's one more person who wants to join.

332
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,560
You mean Phukong?

333
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,920
Yes.

334
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,240
He wants to be like Tine, Mr. Chic.

335
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,560
Who knows? He might get a football player boyfriend too.

336
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Is that right?

337
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,640
Yes.

338
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,480
You can fill out the application form later. Come on, then.

339
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,160
Please take care of him.

340
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,840
Thank you. That was a joke.

341
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,000
All right.

342
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,680
You need to learn our basic pose.

343
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,560
This is our basic pose.

344
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,720
Let's try again. Take a look at this.

345
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,200
Excuse me.

346
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,960
Wat.

347
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,520
You said you'd lower the noise.

348
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,040
With the juniors, I can give them orders, but take a look at this.

349
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,840
-Dim? -Right.

350
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,000
He's still looking for a job. That's why he's always here.

351
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,400
Tine, what are you doing here?

352
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,680
I came to talk about the noise.

353
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,120
You guys are loud. We can't practice.

354
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,640
I talked to him. He said it's your problem.

355
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,840
What can I do?

356
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,320
Dim.

357
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,680
Why aren't you at home?

358
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
You're bothering these kids.

359
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,200
Watch your mouth.

360
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,040
I didn't bother anyone.

361
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,120
Our practice session bothers the Cheerleading Club next door.

362
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,000
This is a music club.

363
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,080
Do you want me to meditate or what?

364
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,280
-Should I start chanting now? -Come on.

365
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,480
What an ass.

366
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,040
Don't forget that this is the Student Affairs Center.

367
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,600
We have to think about other people sharing this building.

368
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,480
Green, whose side are you on?

369
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,080
Any side with no bullies like you.

370
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,760
You like to force people. You've been like this since that time.

371
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,920
Shut up.

372
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,320
Dim.

373
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,040
What is he talking about?

374
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,240
Stay out of it.

375
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
I'm going to play my way.

376
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
If you aren't happy, get out.

377
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,920
-You too. -Fine. I'm going. No need to fire me.

378
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,960
Tine! Can I join your Cheerleading Club?

379
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,720
I'm sick of being around this jerk.

380
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,240
Did you just insult me?

381
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,400
-I did. -Hold on, Dim.

382
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,240
Take it easy.

383
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,000
I just asked you to keep it low.

384
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,360
Easy, Dim. Calm down.

385
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,880
-Don't be mad. -Wat.

386
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,960
Wat, you are the club president.

387
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,760
You carry everyone's dignity.

388
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,520
Now, you tell him if we should lower the noise for them or not.

389
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,560
We shouldn't.

390
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm sorry.

391
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,920
-Please don't be mad. -No.

392
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,760
I'm so tired.

393
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,000
I killed my throat just to be louder than your club.

394
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,440
And here I am being sorry.

395
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
Let me put the lotion on for you.

396
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,320
Please forgive me.

397
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,480
Your lotion smells nice.

398
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Here.

399
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,640
Don't be mad. I was in front of my club members.

400
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,240
I had to go with the flow.

401
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,720
I need to take care of my club members too.

402
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,440
Damn it.

403
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,000
I thought working separately would do us good.

404
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,200
It's even worse now.

405
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,400
Come on. Don't be angry.

406
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,400
I'll sort it out with Dim tomorrow. Okay?

407
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,880
-Don't be mad. Let me give you a massage. -No.

408
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,920
I'm going to bed.

409
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,400
Hey.

410
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Tine.

411
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,840
So you won't forgive me?

412
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,280
Fine. Wait a second.

413
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,560
This song is for my beloved nuisance…

414
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,960
Again?

415
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,600
Type, can I borrow your laptop and put on some music?

416
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,960
Sure. Go ahead.

417
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,800
Someone forgot to log out of his e-mail.

418
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,360
You're finished.

419
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,040
"Details on the marketing team leader position, Phuket office.

420
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,240
Dear Mr. Teerasup.

421
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,160
Please be informed about your promotion and transfer

422
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,040
to the Phuket office."

423
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,160
Will you tell me what's going on?

424
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,920
Do you think I can't tell?

425
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,560
You're overthinking. I'm all right. Just a bit tired.

426
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,960
Oh!

427
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,480
-My name is on the list. -Yes.

428
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,080
Good job, kid.

429
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,240
Are you sure that I will get his attention if I'm a cheerleader?

430
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,400
Believe me. If you keep playing football with him,

431
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,560
he will only see you as his junior.

432
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,760
But if you're a chic and lovely university cheerleader,

433
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,600
you will have his full attention for sure.

434
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,880
-Really? -Really.

435
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,240
Be confident.

436
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,640
Girlfriends.

437
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,680
-Everyone has a girlfriend. -Hey.

438
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,840
Phukong.

439
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
We miss you on the football field.

440
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,120
I have practice.

441
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,320
Practice?

442
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,320
Practice what?

443
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,680
I am a university cheerleader now.

444
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,200
For real?

445
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,920
Good for you.

446
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,240
Anyway,

447
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,400
make time to play football with me too. Don't forget me.

448
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,160
-See you. -Well…

449
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,560
I'd like to have some B2 papers.

450
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,440
He doesn't seem to be interested.

451
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,200
You're stupid.

452
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,120
He kept it inside. Can't you see that?

453
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,960
Poor kid.

454
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,760
Let me tell you. My next plan is going to work for sure.

455
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,960
Which store?

456
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,360
I think it's in the alley.

457
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,720
Hey.

458
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,640
Hi there.

459
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,880
How many songs has he played?

460
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,560
A dozen.

461
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,800
His bass was so loud, we couldn't even practice our moves.

462
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,280
Wait.

463
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,480
I'm not talking about the club. I'm talking about things at home.

464
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,760
What? What about my home?

465
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,240
About your birth…

466
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,800
Look, Ohm.

467
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,040
Well, he…

468
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,760
He's curious…

469
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,800
if you two have sweet moments at home.

470
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,000
That's right.

471
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,960
If you had any idea how seriously our clubs are fighting,

472
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,760
you wouldn't ask that question.

473
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,920
Who on earth put the Music Club next to the Cheerleading Club?

474
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Right.

475
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,560
It's a mess. Green just exploded the other day.

476
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,680
Guys, be ready for "Who Are We?"

477
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,560
So you're doing this.

478
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,760
You want to do this?

479
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,920
I thought things were over, but Dim struck back.

480
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,960
He didn't back down.

481
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,960
Let's go.

482
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Enough! I won't live with this.

483
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,320
Guys!

484
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Let's go.

485
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,480
Dim, you jerk.

486
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,360
Is this how you want it?

487
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,360
Yes. What's your problem?

488
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,880
This is my club.

489
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,760
These speakers are also mine. I'll play as I please.

490
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,520
You can play.

491
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,080
Just pay back the money you borrowed from my dad to buy them.

492
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,040
Wait.

493
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,960
Dim, you said you spent the club budget.

494
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,840
Do you think we had a lot?

495
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,760
We could buy just one Bluetooth speaker with it.

496
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,280
It seems we can't be at peace.

497
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,000
Guys, let's take back these speakers.

498
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,640
-Let's do it. -Okay. Take them.

499
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,680
Tine.

500
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,480
Talk to your friends, please. Phukong.

501
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,400
-What are you doing? -Sorry, bro. My club comes first.

502
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,680
Are you mad?

503
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,440
-I'll make you regret tonight. -Tine, please talk to your friends.

504
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,400
-Come on. -Green gave the order.

505
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,720
You're the club president. We can't practice like this, Tine.

506
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Tine.

507
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,160
Green! I miss you, baby.

508
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,720
I want to kiss you on the cheek.

509
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
I haven't started my Scrubb music festival yet,

510
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,000
and his birthday is tomorrow.

511
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,600
I have one night left.

512
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,560
A love guru once said, "Never let work conflicts

513
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,760
ruin your love life."

514
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
The thing is,

515
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,120
you should do something nice for each other.

516
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,600
Your work might get smoother, and your life sweeter too.

517
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,680
Anyone who's finished with makeup, come over here for the profile photoshoot.

518
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,440
Hurry up.

519
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,120
We still have time.

520
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,560
Excuse me.

521
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,480
Can you put on the wrong foundation and make it really thick for him?

522
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,760
-Sure. -Hey! Are you crazy?

523
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
Trust me.

524
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,320
When Tine had makeup on, Wat cleaned it for him.

525
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,000
If you wear thick makeup, I'm sure Mil will clean it for you.

526
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,920
-Are you sure? -Yes.

527
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,880
Let me know if it's too tight. Can I see the outfit?

528
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,400
Pear is here. Why is she here?

529
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,520
Take it easy, man.

530
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,160
Green asked her to help with the costumes.

531
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,120
Damn.

532
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
It's your chance, my friend.

533
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,120
If I were you, I'd make a move right now.

534
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,360
Are you carrying a perfume bottle around?

535
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,560
-Make it real thick, okay? -Hold on.

536
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,240
They just ignored me.

537
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,760
Hey. What are you doing here?

538
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,040
-See you later, then. -Sure.

539
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,600
We're shooting profile photos.

540
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,680
I see.

541
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
Mil.

542
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,960
Do you think my makeup is too thick?

543
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,120
Well…

544
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,280
No.

545
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,040
Not at all?

546
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,800
Take a look again.

547
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,480
No. It's fine.

548
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,400
I'll see you later.

549
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,520
He couldn't see it, could he?

550
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,360
How was it?

551
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,000
It didn't work at all.

552
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,160
Oh.

553
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,360
-How come? Let me see. -Right.

554
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,520
Could it be that your makeup isn't thick enough?

555
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,200
-Don't you agree? -Yes.

556
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,920
-Put on some more. -It's too much already.

557
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,680
How about you two wear it yourselves?

558
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
I'm going to clean up.

559
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,080
-Wait. -You…

560
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,200
Green, don't forget to send me the pictures you took.

561
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,480
I'll talk to the adviser again about the 2U event budget.

562
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,240
I'm home now. Bye.

563
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,800
What a long day.

564
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,680
I'm starving.

565
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,120
You're the king of complaints.

566
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,080
But I'm really tired.

567
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,960
I had to shout louder than Dim's guitar.

568
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,160
Would you like to listen to a song?

569
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,280
I'll play it for you.

570
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,840
Come on. You're home now. Stop talking about work.

571
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,480
Tine.

572
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,360
Let's talk about us.

573
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,880
Tine.

574
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm weary. I'll take a shower and go to bed.

575
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,640
How about one song? Just one.

576
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,600
I heard your club playing all day. My brain is turning into mush.

577
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,200
But I…

578
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,600
I tuned my guitar since noon for you. Aren't you going to listen?

579
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,640
Please.

580
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,000
A love guru once said, "Never let work conflicts

581
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,640
ruin your love life."

582
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,520
Care to join me in the shower?

583
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,760
Come on.

584
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,200
Just listen to this one Scrubb song.

585
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,440
I've prepared it for you.

586
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,800
It's your call.

587
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,200
Will you play a Scrubb song or scrub my back?

588
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,320
Take your pick.

589
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,240
Tine, wait for me.

590
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,600
HBD TO NUISANCE

591
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,640
Damn. You're a real pervert.

592
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,040
You lost to your sexual desire.

593
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,080
-Let me see. -Fine.

594
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,000
Good.

595
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,520
In the end, you bought a cake just like I said.

596
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,840
How is it for a simple surprise?

597
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,440
We'll have a cake no matter what.

598
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,800
But I just want it to be a little more surprising.

599
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,680
Yes. What a surprise.

600
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,080
-You're hopeless. -Stubborn.

601
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,120
-Here we go. -Call Tine for me.

602
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Wat.

603
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,000
Come out and talk to me.

604
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,640
Did your club just request for my club to move away?

605
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,600
No, it wasn't me.

606
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,840
Who did this?

607
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,520
I did. Get out of my way.

608
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,160
What did you do?

609
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,920
We can't play music because you have a soft spot for Tine.

610
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,600
So I need to take care of it myself.

611
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,320
Fine.

612
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,960
You aren't the only one who can file a report.

613
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,400
We're going to complain that your music club

614
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,320
has been creating loud noises too.

615
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,720
-Let's file a complaint. -Hey! Calm down.

616
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,840
Take it easy, everyone.

617
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,040
We can talk things out. We don't need to report anything.

618
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,320
I think so too. Let's not make this a big deal.

619
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,000
Please, I beg you.

620
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,360
I'm doing this for you two.

621
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,480
Let's draw lots.

622
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,320
Whoever gets the shorter lot

623
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,480
can get out. Ron, give me some lots.

624
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,960
-Okay, Dim. -Ron, wait.

625
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,200
Dim, what are you doing? This isn't what I meant.

626
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,960
-I mean, we should negotiate. -Okay.

627
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,560
If you dare challenge us, we're ready to accept it.

628
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,960
Tine, go ahead.

629
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,080
-Go on. -Fine. If you insist.

630
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,120
Wat, you draw it.

631
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,440
-Please don't do this. -Take it easy.

632
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,400
Green.

633
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,520
-It's annoying. -You don't have to do this.

634
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,240
Please don't be mad. I'm sorry.

635
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,160
-Let's talk things out. -What's that smell?

636
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,760
-It's fire! -Shit.

637
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,440
Dim! Fire!

638
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,840
Green, don't leave!

639
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,200
Help me put it out.

640
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,440
Get the instruments out!

641
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,920
That's super cool.

642
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,120
-Cool, my ass. There's a fire! -Help me get the stuff out.

643
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,840
Hurry!

644
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,760
Hurry up!

645
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,480
-We need water. -Quickly. Go in.

646
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,840
We're screwed.

647
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,320
Hey! Get the costumes in that room.

648
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,160
The costumes are in there!

649
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,040
The costumes! Hurry up!

650
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,720
Everyone, the fire is out now. Luckily, it didn't spread out.

651
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
How did it start?

652
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,960
It's my fault.

653
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,160
It was supposed to be a surprise.

654
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,480
This is what's left of it. I'm sorry.

655
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,880
Damn you, Wat.

656
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
I have no energy left to yell at you.

657
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,120
You see these people?

658
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,560
-They're in trouble because of you. -I'm so sorry.

659
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,800
Sorry, everyone.

660
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,720
Thanks for your help with the instruments, Cheerleading Club.

661
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
We have to thank your club too.

662
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,240
I don't think we need to draw lots anymore.

663
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,240
If we do that, one club needs to move away.

664
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,040
Let's find a way to live together in peace.

665
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Agreed.

666
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,400
We don't practice loudly every day, actually.

667
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,560
How about…

668
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,800
we schedule when we can be loud?

669
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,120
If the club president is okay, then I'm okay too.

670
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,440
It's fine with me. How about Dim?

671
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,840
Well, it's up to the club president.

672
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,280
Okay, then.

673
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,280
If we're all good now, let's take the stuff…

674
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,360
back to our rooms.

675
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,840
Thank you all.

676
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,000
Let's help each other.

677
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,680
Green.

678
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,520
If I stop being an ass,

679
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,560
will you come back to the Music Club?

680
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,040
I don't know.

681
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,120
-I'm taking things back. -Please. I'm sorry.

682
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Don't. I'm helping my friends.

683
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,000
Thank you.

684
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,840
Look at this. What a surprise indeed.

685
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,440
I'll buy you a new one. Okay?

686
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,800
Let's go.

687
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,320
Dim.

688
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,600
This is your ex's guitar, isn't it? You said you sold it.

689
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,960
Keep it down. People might hear.

690
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,680
Why? They all know we're together.

691
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So you still miss your old sweet times?

692
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,080
-Green. -Fine.

693
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,800
Just spend your time with this guitar. Don't come see me anymore.

694
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,000
Wat.

695
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,280
My dear brother, please help me.

696
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,800
Brother. Green.

697
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,080
Get lost!

698
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
What should I do?

699
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,520
The cake is ruined.

700
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,000
I didn't even get any pictures with you.

701
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,360
It's okay. You can always buy a new one.

702
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,400
I know. I'll do that later.

703
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,360
Right.

704
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,800
Fong asked me to join him for a hot pot. Do you want to come?

705
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,480
You go on. I think I'll go home.

706
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,280
Why?

707
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,320
So you can celebrate with your friends.

708
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,160
We can celebrate later at our place.

709
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,280
-Do you mean it? -Yes.

710
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,120
-Are you sure? -Of course. I'm going. Take care.

711
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,320
-See you. -See you.

712
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,680
Tine.

713
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,120
Hey, Type.

714
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,680
Are you here to see Man?

715
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,600
No. I'm here to see you.

716
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,440
-Me? -Right.

717
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,720
Here. Happy birthday!

718
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,400
Wow! You've got me a present.

719
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,960
I may be in Phuket on your next birthday, so I wanted to give you this myself.

720
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,160
This plant is a hot item right now.

721
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,760
-Really? -Yes.

722
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Taking care of plants can relieve your stress.

723
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,520
Thank you.

724
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,800
By the way, have you told Man about Phuket?

725
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,000
Not yet.

726
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,240
I don't know how to do it.

727
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,680
Why? What are you afraid of?

728
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,720
Tine, long-distance relationships are scary.

729
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,520
The distance is one thing, but a third person is quite another.

730
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,440
Though we don't have those problems, we still fight every day.

731
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,680
What if I tell him I'm going to Phuket?

732
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,200
He might break up with me.

733
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Well…

734
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,360
I don't know about that, but if I were you,

735
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,120
I'd tell him straightaway.

736
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,120
And if he's not okay?

737
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,720
At least you tried.

738
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,280
Surprise!

739
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,080
What's with this costume?

740
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,240
Isn't it cute?

741
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,640
Yes.

742
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,800
Can you tell what I am?

743
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,240
I'm a shark.

744
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,920
A sea animal to match the Phuket theme.

745
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,920
Who told you?

746
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Was it Tine?

747
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,840
Between the two of us,

748
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,120
I'm not the only one who forgets to log out of his account.

749
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,720
I'm sorry…

750
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
I didn't tell you earlier.

751
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,440
Are you okay with it?

752
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,720
Of course.

753
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,760
It's a great job opportunity for you.

754
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,080
I understand.

755
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,720
I can follow you there after I graduate.

756
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,120
Thanks a lot.

757
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,920
Oh! I've got something for you.

758
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,400
I went online shopping the other day

759
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,720
and bought two pairs of shoes.

760
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,800
We can wear them and run together.

761
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,280
We're both on a diet, aren't we?

762
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,760
Let's try them on.

763
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,400
Sure.

764
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,520
Aren't they cute?

765
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,560
They are.

766
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,880
There are dolphins on them.

767
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,240
Are you crying?

768
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,800
They're so cute.

769
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,720
Do they fit?

770
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,520
-Perfectly. -Good.

771
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,320
You should wear them too.

772
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,040
Why?

773
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,720
You said we could run together.

774
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,600
When I'm gone, you'll be running with someone else.

775
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,880
Type.

776
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,360
Just put your trust in me.

777
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,640
You should know how hard it was to win you over.

778
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,960
I will never leave you.

779
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,880
You, on the other hand, will get to meet new people

780
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,160
and live in a new place.

781
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,000
I remember one time when you ditched my motorbike for a car.

782
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,720
I can't forget that.

783
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,160
It's still in my head.

784
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,280
It hurts, you know.

785
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,360
If you want me to trust you, you have to trust me too.

786
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,320
Sure.

787
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,320
Of course I do.

788
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,800
Thank you.

789
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,320
See you at the pool.

790
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,320
GLOWING BRIGHT, SARAWOW

791
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,680
-Come on. Help me. -Okay.

792
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,880
I wish you a lot of happiness.

793
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,840
And…

794
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,400
I wish for you to stay with me forever.

795
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,920
How did the big cake turn into this?

796
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,840
This is more than enough.

797
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,080
Thank you so much.

798
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,760
Actually…

799
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,360
I was going to play you a Scrubb song every day,

800
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,600
but the plan failed.

801
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,720
I hope this is okay with you.

802
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,360
-Look. -What?

803
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,240
It has a disturbing face just like you.

804
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,560
It's my doll. It has to look like me.

805
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,080
Here.

806
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,320
Let me check this.

807
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,960
-Wow. -Hey.

808
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,680
It's Sarawat Expo.

809
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,040
It's authentic.

810
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,000
You're nuts.

811
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,320
Come here.

812
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,720
I have a bonus for you.

813
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,720
-Would you like to hear it? -Of course.

814
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,120
My heart goes to you

815
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,520
Our hands are held tight

816
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,160
We get it all by just one glance

817
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,680
No words needed

818
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,800
Walking hand in hand

819
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,960
Sharing our love

820
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,280
Pay no attention to other people

821
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,040
I'm right here next to you

822
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,760
My heart is full of love for you

823
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,640
May this love of ours

824
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,280
Live on forever

825
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,400
May this love of ours

826
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,280
Be everlasting love

827
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,840
May this love of ours

828
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,160
Live on forever

829
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,960
May this love of ours

830
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,600
Be everlasting love

831
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,840
Happy birthday.

832
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,600
Thank you.

833
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,480
