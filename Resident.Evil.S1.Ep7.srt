00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,019
Clear the tent.

173
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,856
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

174
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,317
-[Saqim] Mrs. Marcus.
-Evelyn.

175
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,822
Ah, we met before, uh,
when you spoke in Riyadh in 2019.

176
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,532
[Evelyn] Small world.

177
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:58,617
[tongue clicks]

178
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,202
Can I offer you a glass of champagne?

179
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,038
[Saqim] Mm. I don't drink anymore.

180
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,748
I don't drink any less.

181
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:05,916
[cautious chuckle]

182
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,503
-Feels like I'm meeting a celebrity.
-[bottle clacks]

183
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,339
The University hiding on a ship.

184
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,591
Smart.

185
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,511
I want Jade Wesker.

186
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,640
She's a member of our community.

187
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,891
A valued member?

188
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,770
-All members have value.
-Of course. Let me rephrase.

189
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:30,232
Is Jade Wesker valuable enough
to put the lives of your people in danger?

190
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,318
Aw, Evelyn.

191
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:40,117
I understand you have, uh,
many troops with many guns,

192
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,079
and I understand you might see
my people as… academics.

193
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,332
Oxford dons in their tweeds and tassels.

194
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,667
I do love a good tassel.

195
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:52,921
But believe me when I say
we have weapons of our own.

196
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,091
We are also in possession of a hard drive

197
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,803
taken from an Umbrella facility
in Bali in 2022.

198
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:04,016
The contents of which I am sure
Umbrella would not want exposed.

199
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:05,767
[tongue clicks]

200
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:09,104
Saqim, I… I'm gonna make this
very simple for you.

201
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,275
You can threaten me all you want,
but all those troops and all those guns,

202
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,110
they're still gonna board your ship.

203
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,028
Yes, but--

204
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,156
And I'm sure there's some
very nasty things on that hard drive,

205
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,993
and I'm sure you've got someone ready
to broadcast them to the world. So…

206
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,705
Go ahead. Maybe it'll ruin us.

207
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,416
But you and all your people?
You'll never know.

208
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,335
Because unless I get what I want,

209
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,546
I'm gonna turn your little fucking
love boat into the Titanic.

210
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,256
Understand?

211
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,262
[uneasy music]

212
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,059
[doors hisses opened]

213
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,895
So we've had some time to…

214
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,565
[breathes deeply]

215
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,317
…calm down.

216
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,694
Take some…

217
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,405
cleansing breaths.

218
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:02,491
Hmm?

219
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,076
I know what you want, Evelyn.

220
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,538
This isn't the way to get it.

221
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,207
I'm afraid both our hands are tied.

222
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,753
That reporter, we ran his blood.

223
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:21,426
Turns out, you gave him a dose of Joy
that's three times the lethal limit.

224
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,764
-Do you want to tell me why?
-You can't do this.

225
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,433
-And I won't help you.
-Sure you will.

226
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,894
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be playing grab-ass

227
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,230
with Tweedledee and Tweedledum
in that rathole.

228
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,315
I didn't ask for your help.

229
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,776
[chuckles, sucks teeth]

230
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,237
But you took it, didn't you?

231
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:45,075
You begged me to get out of that cell,
and I'm just a big softie, I guess,

232
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,785
because I took pity on you.

233
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:53,625
The deal was, you do what I ask,
and, in exchange, I let you have a life.

234
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,919
And I let you create life.

235
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:01,008
So why are you making my life
so difficult?

236
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,759
And Bert?

237
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,804
What kind of a deal did you make with him?

238
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,891
Is he the one
who's been changing Joy's formula?

239
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,686
Jesus, Evelyn. He's unstable.

240
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,397
[humming]

241
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,819
[humming continues]

242
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,948
[chuckles]

243
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,036
[tense music]

244
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,874
[man choking]

245
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,298
[groaning]

246
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,946
[young Billie] Is it Dad?

247
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,073
[young Jade] Simon.

248
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,075
-Ignore him.
-I am.

249
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,787
What about you? Anything?

250
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,208
When do we start to worry?

251
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,090
Now?

252
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,092
[Evelyn] I trusted you.

253
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,261
I convinced myself you were different.

254
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,596
Special.

255
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,349
That it would be interesting
to see if a clone could acclimate

256
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,226
to the real world.

257
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,311
You fooled a lot of people, Al.

258
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:43,735
-But if we can get Joy--
-[Albert] That's all you care about?

259
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,196
The next product juicing the stock price?

260
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,155
[Evelyn sighs]

261
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,490
People have died!

262
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:52,744
And more people could be saved!
Just fucking think about it!

263
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:58,000
Depression, anxiety, suicide. Just…

264
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,876
gone!

265
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,004
That's…

266
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,173
Fuck the bottom line.

267
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:08,760
That's changing the world. Come on, Al.

268
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:12,014
Don't you want to change
the world with me?

269
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,100
Like you care.

270
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,688
[scoffs]

271
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,526
I bet everything on this.

272
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,739
My job, my reputation, my marriage.

273
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,742
Everything.

274
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,245
I care.

275
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,960
So even if you don't,
you're gonna help me.

276
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,090
Bert's notes. Get to work.

277
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,301
[phone ringing]

278
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,096
Hey, sweetie. Yeah, just here with Albert.

279
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,557
He says hi.

280
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,518
[Evelyn] Yeah.

281
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,525
[knocks on door]

282
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,651
[Bea] Mom?

283
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,738
Bea?

284
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:15,410
[Bea] I snuck out.

285
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,746
What's happening? Amrita.

286
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,623
-[Bea] She's--
-I know.

287
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,337
-[Bea] You said it would be okay.
-I know.

288
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,798
[Jade] I need you to be strong, okay?

289
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,052
Bea, I need you to go to our cabin.

290
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,012
Okay? I need you to go to my bed.

291
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,223
Look under it. There's a green duffel bag.

292
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,599
Why?

293
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,768
[Jade] It has everything you'll need.

294
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,396
I need you and Dad to get off the ship.

295
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:45,816
[Bea] Why?

296
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,947
Because the people out there
are bad people.

297
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,323
[Jade] They want to hurt you.

298
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,243
-Dad says--
-[Jade] Yeah, look, I know what Dad says.

299
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,286
But he doesn't know them like I do.

300
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,872
Bea, you have to believe me.

301

[sniffles]

303
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,090
And if Dad won't go with you,
I need you to go on your own.

304
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,175
[Bea] What?

305
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,511
What about you?

306
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,351
I'll be right behind you.

307
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:26,523
Bea…

308
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:28,859
[sniffles]

309
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,944
I'm so sorry for all of this.

310
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:37,117
[Jade] I never wanted any of this for you.
I just wanted you to be safe and happy.

311
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,373
But I need you to do this for me, okay?

312
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:45,709
You promise me.

313
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,629
I promise.

314
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,557
Anything?

315
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:03,810
Still no.

316
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,729
I mean, what if we never hear from him?

317
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,063
Then we call the police.

318
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,149
-The Umbrella police?
-[Simon] Jade.

319
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,109
Hey, I've been texting you.

320

[honking continues]

322
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,245
That's our dad.

323
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,207
-But can we just talk--
-I'm sorry.

324
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,251
[young Billie] Who's car is this?

325
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,422
Uh-oh, I… decided to upgrade my wheels.

326
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,049
But only the best for…

327
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,760
my girls.

328
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,722
[young Billie] What happened?

329
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,432
At Umbrella?

330
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,644
You know, work, work, work.

331
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:46,728
How was school?

332
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,564
Did you see "him"?

333
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,151
Oh, yeah, I saw him.

334

00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,502
Bert.

497
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,590
Wait, he, he… he never mentioned me?

498
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:56,426
So you're like, what?

499
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,053
His twin?

500
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,805
Sort of. We're clones.

501
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,851
"Clones"?

502
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,561
There was a third one of us, Alby,

503
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:09,730
but he was killed
by the original Albert Wesker.

504
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:10,690
Our creator.

505
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:11,899
"Creator."

506
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:14,110
We were part of, like,
a research and development team

507
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,361
he put together to help him.

508
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,238
He died in a volcano.

509
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,823
It's okay, though. He wasn't very nice.

510
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:20,825
Didn't like me much.

511
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,577
[Bert chuckles]
But don't worry.

512
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,537
Me and your dad, we're nothing like him.

513
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,831
I mean, genetically,
were exactly like him.

514
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,708
But everything else, totally different.

515
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,627
I mean, he was a monster.
He liked hurting people.

516
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:32,545
[scoffs]

517
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:36,132
But I think we've all got
these feelings inside us, right?

518
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,426
Happy feelings, sad feelings, and…

519

[breathes deeply]

520
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:46,768
…feelings like sometimes you just want
to punch someone in the face so hard.

521
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:48,936
[Bert exhales]

522
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:53,191
Well, anyways,
I think we all have a choice.

523
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,568
We can choose who we are. Who we wanna be.

524
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,696
And I choose… breadsticks.

[Bert] What?

529
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,794
If you don't, we'll scream.

[young Jade] Shit.

and spin up the engines.

And, Billie, you must be terrified.

That horrible man.

593
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:08,487
He said he was a clone.

594
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,781
-Is that true?
-Because if it is…

595
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,075
that's fucking insane.

596
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:17,788
Yeah. Well, fucking insane
is kind of what we do, so…

598
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,545
I know you girls have questions.

That wave of fear and confusion
you're feeling right now, I've felt that.

Never really knew my father.

601
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:35,639
He… he was a very brilliant,
very private man.

602
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:38,434
To protect me,
I was kept in the dark about things.

603
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,311
Things he thought I couldn't handle.

604
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:41,937
But…

605
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:47,860
us girls, we're tougher and smarter
than people give us credit for.

[Evelyn exhales]

620
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,607
I wish there was a more elegant way
to do this, too, girls.

Take your medicine, Albert.

623
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:38,119
[young Jade] What's happening?

624
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,162
[Evelyn] Do you want
to tell them or should I?

625
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,247
[shaky breathing]

626
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,414
Okay, I'll do it.

627
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,336
Your father's dying.

628
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:52,716
Like good ol' Bert told you,
he's a clone, which… Weird, sure.

629
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,012
But really, it's a very simple process
involving a little DNA,

630
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,182
a few empty cells,
and a very unfortunate woman.

631
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,602
But being a clone
isn't your father's problem.

632
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,312
The rapid aging is.

633
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:10,901
See, Wesker,
OG Wesker was an impatient man.

634
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,946
He's cloned himself
a little army of geniuses,

635
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,115
and he wasn't gonna wait
for them to grow up.

636
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:22,121
So, with our good friend science,
your father went from born to 20 years old

637
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,498
in less than six months.

638
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,002
But accelerating the cells
that way leads to…

639
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:29,795
problems.

640
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:36,594
Cancer, mitochondrial explosion,
all sorts of nasty things.

641
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:39,972
Your father's sick. So he invented a cure.

642
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,100
You.

643
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,186
What?

644
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,897
He engineered your blood
to fix his problem,

645
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,691
which, like I said, he's a genius.

646
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,776
That's not true.

647
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,819
Isn't it?

648
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:00,034

00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:43,494
That's…

656
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,705
That's why you were taking our blood.

657
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:49,583
-Billie, please.
-Stop. Just stop!

658
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:52,878
[young Billie] I don't know what you are.

659
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,131
