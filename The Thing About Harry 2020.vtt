00:20.062 --> 00:21.271
This is nice.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.106
Mm‐hmm.
So nice.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.444
‐Sam?
‐Mm‐hmm?

00:28.487 --> 00:29.488
Do you have a...

00:30.322 --> 00:31.657
Ew. No.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.575
Then what's poking
my back?

00:33.575 --> 00:35.202
It's my phone.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.703
‐Relax.
‐(laughing)

00:36.703 --> 00:38.163
I was like,
oh my God,

00:38.163 --> 00:39.540
I hope he's not trying
to get up on this.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.416
Ugh. Gross.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.293
Okay, you don't have
to say it like that, homo.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.920
‐It doesn't bite.
‐Hey!

00:44.920 --> 00:46.088
We talked about this.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.381
You can't use
that word.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.507
You say it!

00:48.507 --> 00:49.466
I'm allowed.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.051
You don't gotta be mean
about it.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.638
Okay, swap.
I wanna be little spoon.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.142
(moans)

01:01.395 --> 01:03.188
So what are you doing
this weekend?

01:04.147 --> 01:05.983
For Valentine's Day?
Nothing.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.901
You're not going out
with Gary?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.653
Oh my God, no.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.697
That's something
a boyfriend/girlfriend
would do.

01:11.697 --> 01:12.990
You know
that's not my jam.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.367
You guys have been dating
for, like, three years.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.910
I think you can call him
your boyfriend,

01:16.910 --> 01:18.328
everybody else does.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.330
Are you trying
to start a fight?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.501
What about you,
Samwich?

01:24.501 --> 01:25.377
You okay?

01:26.169 --> 01:28.964
You mean because this is
my first Valentine's Day

01:28.964 --> 01:30.007
without Malcolm?

01:30.966 --> 01:32.426
It's been
a couple months.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.344
You ready to get back
on the horse?

01:35.178 --> 01:36.972
There will be
no horses

01:37.598 --> 01:40.100
of any kind
in my immediate future.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.645
Which is why I'm so glad
to be getting out of here

01:43.645 --> 01:45.022
for a few days.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.482
Don't have to go to any
of those awful singles parties

01:47.482 --> 01:49.693
and have people give me
those horrible looks

01:49.693 --> 01:52.362
and try to set me up
with guys named Troy

01:52.362 --> 01:53.697
and Devin.

01:54.865 --> 01:58.994
I am just so not ready
for that right now.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.497
Wait, what do you mean
you're getting out of here?

02:02.497 --> 02:03.457
Where're you going?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.126
My friends,
Kelly and Kris?

02:07.294 --> 02:08.919
From high school?
Their engagement party.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.547
We talked about this.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.424
I must've
blocked it out.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.800
My God!

02:13.800 --> 02:16.011
You're going all the way home
for an engagement party?

02:16.011 --> 02:18.180
Ugh. You are
a good friend.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.931
Yes, I am.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.017
(cell phone buzzing)

02:23.143 --> 02:25.354
Speak of the devils.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.439
Hi!

02:27.439 --> 02:28.649
How are you?

02:28.649 --> 02:31.151
How does it feel
to be "affianced"?

02:31.151 --> 02:32.402
Affi‐what?

02:32.402 --> 02:33.987
Affianced.
It means engaged.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.156
Oh! (laughs)

02:36.156 --> 02:38.033
I like that.
Af‐financed.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.618
Like, give me
my money, husband.

02:39.618 --> 02:40.619
No, I‐‐

02:40.619 --> 02:41.870
‐Never mind.
‐It feels amazing!

02:41.870 --> 02:43.622
We're so excited that
you're coming home
for our party!

02:43.622 --> 02:44.498
Ask him about Harry.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.749
I'm going to,
give me a sec.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.000
‐Ask me what?
‐He's not gonna mind.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.128
So listen, we have
a small favor to ask.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.963
Anything for the bride
and groom.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.131
‐Great.
‐Oh my God.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.633
Could you...
would you mind

02:54.633 --> 02:56.176
giving Harry a lift?

02:56.677 --> 02:57.969
Harry? Harry who?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.139
Harry... Turpin.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.808
Harry Turpin.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.643
Eh, you don't mean
Harry Turpin?

03:04.643 --> 03:05.811
Harry Turpin
who hates me?

03:05.811 --> 03:07.312
Harry Turpin
who made fun of me

03:07.312 --> 03:08.980
pretty much every day
in high school?

03:08.980 --> 03:10.148
Yeah.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.608
You're not
seriously asking me

03:11.608 --> 03:12.943
to spend nine hours
alone in a car

03:12.943 --> 03:14.277
with Harry frickin' Turpin,
are you?

03:14.277 --> 03:16.238
No way!
Say no, Sam.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.572
Kinda.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.366
It's just you guys
go to the same school.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.826
And he was supposed to
drive out with his girlfriend,

03:20.826 --> 03:22.327
but I guess they broke up
or something.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.079
‐Shocking.
‐And he doesn't have a car,

03:24.079 --> 03:26.248
so he won't be able
to come, unless...

03:27.040 --> 03:28.750
‐I don't know, Kelly.
‐Say no.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.293
You know, give it to me.
I'll tell her.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.920
No. Stop it.
Stop. Stop.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.963
We really want
him there.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.756
Kris really wants
him there.

03:34.756 --> 03:35.841
Please.

03:35.841 --> 03:36.758
Hey.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.843
What's that sound?

03:37.843 --> 03:38.677
Where are you?

03:39.177 --> 03:40.512
Hell, apparently.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.140
Um, yes, okay.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.474
I will bring Harry.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.184
Oh my God!
Thank you!

03:46.184 --> 03:49.020
Tell him to meet me outside
the Student Union 7 a. m. sharp.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.022
If he is late,
I swear to God

03:51.022 --> 03:52.274
‐I'm leaving without him.
‐He'll be there.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.693
Thank you, Sam.
Thank you, thank you.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.319
‐See you Saturday!
‐Mm‐hmm.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.991
Wow!

04:00.991 --> 04:03.201
You, my friend,
are a medical marvel.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.621
It's a wonder you can
stand up at all without
a spine like that.

04:16.755 --> 04:17.757
(Sam sighs)

04:21.803 --> 04:22.971
(cell phone buzzes)

04:25.182 --> 04:26.141
Oh!

04:27.100 --> 04:29.144
‐Everything okay?
‐He's not here.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.312
What an asshole.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.730
See, and that's
the thing about Harry.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.273
No concern
for anybody else,

04:33.273 --> 04:34.941
just shows up whenever
the hell he wants to.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.527
Ugh. I never should
have agreed to this.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.321
No, you really
shouldn't have.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.615
You could always leave.
You'd be perfectly justified.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.159
Fine, I'll give him
till 7:15.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.160
What are you doing?

04:45.160 --> 04:46.995
7:10 in the morning,
what do you think I'm doing?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.663
Oh my gosh,
did I wake you?

04:48.663 --> 04:49.998
Yeah, but it's fine.
I don't mind.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.583
‐I mind.
‐Shut up, Gary.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.542
No one cares
what you think.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.585
Tell him
I said hi.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.420
‐Gary says hi.
‐Hi, Gary.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.839
Okay, sorry I woke you guys.
Go back to bed.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.174
No, no, no,
I'll stay on.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.592
Now remember,

05:00.592 --> 05:02.177
if he starts anything,

05:02.177 --> 05:04.513
any, any name‐calling
or anything at all,

05:04.513 --> 05:06.306
you just pull over

05:06.306 --> 05:08.016
and tell him,
"Get the hell out."

05:08.642 --> 05:09.976
‐Got it.
‐Say it.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.813
‐What?
‐Practice. I wanna hear you.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.523
I'm not gonna...

05:15.649 --> 05:16.733
Fine.
Get the hell out.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.485
You're kidding, right?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.654
What the hell
kinda command is that?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.323
I tell Gary
to pick up my ice cream
more forcefully than that.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.783
Again.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.159
(louder):
Get the hell out!

05:26.159 --> 05:28.370
Again! From those
underused balls of yours!

05:28.370 --> 05:29.788
(low, growly voice):
Get the hell out!

05:29.788 --> 05:31.623
Again! Like the lion
that you are!

05:31.623 --> 05:33.333
(shouting):
Get the hell out!

05:33.667 --> 05:34.876
‐Sorry.
‐Stasia: <i>Okay, good.</i>

05:35.335 --> 05:36.795
<i>You're gonna be fine,</i>
<i>babe, okay.</i>

05:36.795 --> 05:37.921
<i>Call me if you need me.</i>

05:37.921 --> 05:39.422
I will. Bye.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.423
‐Stasia: <i>Mmm.</i>
‐(cell phone beeps)

05:45.262 --> 05:46.263
(exhales heavily)

05:47.889 --> 05:48.932
Sam: I said 7 a. m.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.476
Sharp. He's not here,
that's not my fault.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.856
And the good news is

05:55.856 --> 05:58.400
I don't have
to spend nine hours

05:58.400 --> 05:59.526
in a car with...

05:59.526 --> 06:01.486
Wait, hey, hey, hey,
no, no, no, wait, wait...

06:01.486 --> 06:03.154
...Harry Turpin.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.656
Hey! Hey! Yo!

06:10.996 --> 06:11.997
Thanks, man.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.129
All right, I know I'm
a few minutes late, but...

06:19.129 --> 06:20.463
‐Try 20.
‐...not my fault.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.966
See, my roommate made
these killer tacos last night.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.094
And this morning I had
to evacuate the building,

06:26.094 --> 06:27.596
if you know
what I mean.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.431
And it put me
a little behind sched.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.057
But I made it.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.643
We're here,
road‐trippin' home.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.312
No harm,
no foul balls.

06:36.563 --> 06:37.981
Although my balls may be

06:38.356 --> 06:40.233
a little foul, 'cause...

06:40.901 --> 06:42.319
I didn't have time
to shower, you get me?

06:43.570 --> 06:45.322
I... get you.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.366
Oh, would you mind making
a quick stop at The Drip?

06:48.366 --> 06:49.826
I'm gonna need
some serious caffeine

06:49.826 --> 06:51.536
if I'm gonna be
good company for you.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.169
And then she lost her mind

06:59.169 --> 07:02.047
because I forgot
our three‐month anniversary!

07:02.047 --> 07:03.506
I mean, is that
even a thing?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.342
Like, who remembers shit
like that?

07:05.342 --> 07:06.801
I don't know,

07:06.801 --> 07:07.802
thoughtful people?

07:07.802 --> 07:09.137
Mmm.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.306
Of course you say that,
you never forget anything.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.767
Yo, remember that time
you reminded Mrs. Brown

07:13.767 --> 07:15.518
we were supposed
to have a bio quiz?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.479
And everyone got
so pissed at you?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.939
Yeah, I remember.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.484
Because I had studied
like we were supposed to,

07:22.484 --> 07:24.027
and I didn't want
to get behind, you know.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.780
We had those big projects
in English and Social Studies.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.325
Plus, it was the first time
that you called me
"Suck‐up Sammy,"

07:30.325 --> 07:32.869
so... not something
I'm likely to forget.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.579
Hey, who called you
"Suck‐up Sammy"?

07:35.121 --> 07:36.039
You.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.415
‐Me?
‐Yeah.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.125
‐No.
‐Yeah.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.126
No way, man.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.753
You're saying
I made that up?

07:41.753 --> 07:42.921
I gave you
that nickname?

07:42.921 --> 07:43.922
Mm‐hmm.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.675
I don't think so, dude.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.968
Trust me,
I remember.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.221
Because after you called me
Suck‐up Sammy,

07:51.221 --> 07:53.139
Davey Glick thought
it would be funnier

07:53.139 --> 07:54.974
to call me
Suck‐up Samantha,

07:54.974 --> 07:57.602
and that's what people
called me for the rest
of high school so...

07:57.977 --> 07:59.938
I think I remember
who started it.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.192
All right, I guess.
If you say so.

08:05.985 --> 08:06.986
That's a good one.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.198
You know what?
I'm pretty wiped.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.741
I haven't slept in,
like, three days

08:11.741 --> 08:13.618
because of studying
for mid‐term, so...

08:14.494 --> 08:16.287
maybe we have
a little quiet time.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.998
Yeah. Sure thing.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.000
Gotcha.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.296
But, I mean,
three‐month anniversaries.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.382
Like, who even thinks
about things like that.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.431
And then this other girl,
we go to this nude beach, right.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.767
Lotta schlongs,
also a few schlorts.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.520
Anyway, so she says
I'm looking around too much

08:40.520 --> 08:43.898
and that I keep
checking other girls out
while she's around

08:43.898 --> 08:46.317
and she just gets
super insecure about that...

08:47.736 --> 08:50.363
So I catch her
going through my phone,

08:50.363 --> 08:52.657
and I finally have
to say enough, I'm out.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.992
Can you believe that, bro?

08:53.992 --> 08:57.037
Can I believe that you drove
multiple women insane

08:57.037 --> 08:58.830
to the point of
a total psychotic break?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.081
Yes. Yes, I can.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.249
Oh‐kay.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.793
‐Ouch‐‐
‐So you just move on.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.588
As soon as it gets
hard or weird,

09:06.588 --> 09:09.466
before you start
to catch feelings,
you just bolt.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.885
Okay, I‐I don't know if I'd
put it quite like that, but‐‐

09:11.885 --> 09:14.596
You spent the last three hours
recounting every detail

09:14.596 --> 09:17.057
of your past
five relationships,

09:17.057 --> 09:19.100
and the most
amazing thing is that

09:19.100 --> 09:20.769
in every single one
of them

09:20.769 --> 09:23.646
you did absolutely
nothing wrong.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.482
And yet,

09:25.482 --> 09:27.358
they all have
the same complaints.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.653
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe, uh,

09:30.653 --> 09:32.155
I don't know, maybe,

09:32.155 --> 09:34.115
you had something to do
with what happened.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.701
You know what?
You're probably right.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.995
I mean, at the very least,
I picked them all.

09:39.537 --> 09:40.872
I must like the drama.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.875
And it's not just the girls,
the last guy I dated
was completely nut...

09:43.875 --> 09:46.002
See, that's exactly what I‐‐
Wait, what?

09:47.378 --> 09:48.421
Guy? Wha...

09:49.172 --> 09:50.715
What do you mean, "guy"?

09:53.051 --> 09:55.637
As in not a girl.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.015
I'm pan.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.101
‐Pan?
‐Hmm.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.063
You're... a pan?
What does that mean?

10:05.522 --> 10:06.606
Pansexual.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.901
I... it means that
I don't have a preference

10:09.901 --> 10:11.236
‐in terms of genders or‐‐
‐No, no. No.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.821
No, I, I know
what it means.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.907
What do you mean
you're...

10:15.907 --> 10:18.076
Well, I mean, I used
to call myself bi,

10:18.076 --> 10:20.995
but somebody schooled me
that pan is way more inclusive

10:20.995 --> 10:23.248
and also honestly
just more... me.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.376
You know, I'm surprised
you didn't know this already.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.545
My mom practically put it
in the family Christmas letter

10:28.545 --> 10:29.754
the year I came out.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.131
But, hey,
now that you know,

10:31.131 --> 10:32.715
maybe we could hit up
some of the bars

10:32.715 --> 10:34.217
in Boystown
together sometime.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.177
Most of my boys are straight,

10:36.177 --> 10:38.596
so I could use
a good gay wingman.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.016
Dude, you okay?

10:44.060 --> 10:44.978
Dude?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.438
(horn blaring)

10:47.438 --> 10:51.192
(both screaming)

10:51.484 --> 10:52.902
Harry:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:53.528 --> 10:56.364
(breathing heavily)

11:02.537 --> 11:04.581
I guess something called
a tie bar broke,

11:04.581 --> 11:06.124
and they have to get
a part from Hannibal,

11:06.124 --> 11:07.542
so we gotta
spend the night.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.671
I'm fine, Dad.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.589
Don't worry.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.592
Um, "How's Harry?"

11:16.217 --> 11:18.219
<i>He's different.</i>

11:19.304 --> 11:20.638
He's changed a lot
since high school.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.265
Harry: I got sustenance.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.683
Beer, chips,

11:23.683 --> 11:25.977
and for protein,
beef jerky.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.563
It was that
or cat food, so...

11:29.063 --> 11:30.315
Oh, sorry.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.357
Dad, I should go.

11:31.858 --> 11:32.859
All right, I...

11:33.401 --> 11:34.485
love you too.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.325
‐Harry: Beer?
‐Oh, oh.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.454
So you really
didn't know?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.664
I really did not.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.959
Thought you had me pegged
a long time ago.

11:50.668 --> 11:51.753
Why would I?

11:53.171 --> 11:55.632
I, I know you caught me
staring at you sometimes.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.092
Well, because I thought
you hated me!

11:58.676 --> 11:59.552
Oh!

12:00.136 --> 12:01.304
No. Not at all.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.640
Truth is,
I admired you.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.725
I'm sorry. I...

12:06.184 --> 12:07.977
I don't even know how‐‐
What?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.187
I mean, you were out.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.189
In Liberty, Missouri.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.733
Me, I was just...

12:13.733 --> 12:14.776
too scared.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.320
That's why I made fun of you,
you know that, right?

12:17.904 --> 12:20.365
Because I thought
that if anybody

12:20.365 --> 12:21.991
saw me be nice
to you, then...

12:22.659 --> 12:25.328
I'd be guilty
by association, and...

12:26.663 --> 12:27.789
Yeah, I was just...

12:28.498 --> 12:29.999
I wasn't ready
for that.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.543
But that's no excuse.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.962
I never should have
treated you like that.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.382
I mean it, man.
I was a dick.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.385
I really am sorry.

12:46.933 --> 12:47.976
So what's next for you?

12:48.643 --> 12:50.144
After we graduate?

12:50.144 --> 12:52.730
Well, I was thinking about
going to grad school, but...

12:53.690 --> 12:56.109
I don't know, I think that
I need to just get out there

12:56.109 --> 12:58.861
get some real world
experience, so...

12:59.487 --> 13:01.739
I'll probably just get
on a local campaign.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.325
Like political campaigns?

13:04.325 --> 13:05.243
Mm‐hmm.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.787
Is that what you've
been studying? Politics?

13:08.663 --> 13:10.248
Hmm. What?

13:10.581 --> 13:11.958
I'm kind of surprised.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.961
I mean, you seem like
a nice guy, and‐‐

13:14.961 --> 13:16.629
Nice guys don't go
into politics?

13:17.046 --> 13:18.298
Kinda. Yeah.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.799
Well, we need
more nice guys

13:19.799 --> 13:21.134
in politics.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.220
Or else we're never gonna fix
this messed‐up world we got.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.597
Hmm? You're gonna fix
the messed‐up world, huh?

13:26.889 --> 13:28.266
Yeah. I am.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.435
Good for you.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.145
I like that.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.607
So what about you?

13:38.860 --> 13:42.655
What does the future have
in store for Harry Turpin?

13:43.406 --> 13:45.908
I don't know. I try not
to think about it too much.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.201
Hmm.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.786
That's why I need someone
like you around.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.330
Someone like me?

13:51.831 --> 13:52.749
You know...

13:53.374 --> 13:54.792
driven,

13:54.792 --> 13:56.794
a little extra.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.047
(gasps)
I'm not extra!

13:59.380 --> 14:01.674
Dude, you're like
the living definition of extra.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.676
‐No!
‐Man, whatever you say,

14:03.676 --> 14:05.970
Mr. Seven AM Sharp.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.181
Okay. Okay.
Stop deflecting.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.557
We're talking
about you now.

14:11.726 --> 14:12.935
I guess...

14:13.478 --> 14:16.064
the only thing I really knew
I wanted was...

14:16.064 --> 14:17.273
a family.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.399
To be a dad.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.527
Uh, what about you?

14:22.862 --> 14:23.863
You want kids?

14:23.863 --> 14:24.947
I mean, to be honest,

14:24.947 --> 14:27.241
I think I would be
too afraid

14:27.241 --> 14:29.077
to bring a kid
into this world right now,

14:29.077 --> 14:30.995
well, with, like,
climate change

14:30.995 --> 14:34.248
and, you know, just
the general state of things.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.208
I get it.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.460
I think about
that stuff too, but...

14:39.170 --> 14:41.130
I don't know,
sometimes you just
gotta listen to your heart

14:41.798 --> 14:44.717
and trust that
everything is gonna work out.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.304
Listening to your heart...

14:48.805 --> 14:51.390
trusting, that's
not my strength.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.894
We all got something
to learn, I guess.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.190
You can trust me,
you know.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.194
I can trust the man
who can't remember

15:03.194 --> 15:04.570
a three month‐aversary?

15:06.572 --> 15:08.199
Cubs or White Sox?

15:08.199 --> 15:09.492
Or the Royals?

15:09.492 --> 15:11.953
Cubs. Duh.
Always love an underdog.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.331
You can't call
the Cubs an underdog

15:15.331 --> 15:16.666
if they won
the World Series.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.293
They ate rocks
my entire childhood.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.962
They could win
the next ten World Series,

15:20.962 --> 15:22.630
and I could still
call them an underdog.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.841
Wha‐what was
your favorite movie?

15:26.592 --> 15:27.844
Okay, but don't laugh.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.095
Okay, I promise.

15:32.723 --> 15:33.641
<i>Up.</i>

15:34.392 --> 15:35.434
<i>Up?</i>

15:36.310 --> 15:38.604
With the, the talking dogs
who fly the airplanes?

15:38.604 --> 15:39.730
You said you
weren't gonna laugh.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.858
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I just...

15:42.692 --> 15:44.235
I never would have
thought that

15:44.235 --> 15:45.736
that you would say...

15:45.736 --> 15:48.322
It's just, it's just
the beginning of
that movie, okay,

15:48.322 --> 15:50.158
where you see
the whole relationship

15:50.158 --> 15:52.410
between the old man
and his wife

15:52.410 --> 15:53.953
and then she dies.

15:54.662 --> 15:55.663
It's just...

15:56.080 --> 15:58.499
That's the first time
I knew what love was

15:58.499 --> 16:01.419
and... the kind
of love I wanted.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.046
Wow!

16:05.173 --> 16:07.550
You're kind of
a romantic, huh?

16:11.804 --> 16:12.805
I like that movie too.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.103
Did you ever

16:19.770 --> 16:21.564
hook up with anyone
from high school?

16:23.191 --> 16:24.650
‐Guys, you mean?
‐Mm‐hmm.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.445
Hell no.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.447
Did you?

16:29.447 --> 16:31.157
I made out
with Scotty Sharp once.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.491
But that was about it.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.827
He's... definitely straight.

16:37.288 --> 16:40.249
You know who I always thought
was a little not straight.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.335
‐Hmm?
‐Kris.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.545
(gasps)
Kelly's Kris?

16:44.545 --> 16:46.088
No, me too!

16:46.088 --> 16:48.299
And now he and Kelly
are engaged. Oh!

16:48.299 --> 16:50.134
You know
what's even weirder

16:50.134 --> 16:51.802
than the kinda gay thing?

16:51.802 --> 16:55.640
He and Kelly have been
best friends since,
like, sixth grade.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.558
Yeah. Well, you know
what they say,

16:57.558 --> 16:59.644
you're supposed to marry
your best friend, so...

17:00.478 --> 17:02.855
I guess. But I don't think
that's what they meant.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.815
I don't know,
I mean,

17:05.358 --> 17:07.734
I guess it's fine
for straight people,

17:07.734 --> 17:10.613
but a couple guys
could never do that.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.114
Really?

17:12.114 --> 17:13.907
‐You don't think?
‐No way.

17:13.907 --> 17:16.493
Once guys are
in the friend zone,
there's no getting out.

17:17.078 --> 17:20.248
The best you can hope for
is one night of awful sex

17:20.248 --> 17:22.708
but more than likely,
you're gonna have a lousy lay

17:22.708 --> 17:23.834
and ruin the friendship.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.963
Seriously, there is no way

17:26.963 --> 17:28.798
you don't end up worse off
than when you started.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.299
How can you be
so sure?

17:31.092 --> 17:32.385
I mean, l‐let's just say

17:33.010 --> 17:35.346
Malcolm and I
started out as friends,

17:35.972 --> 17:37.682
then, you know,
we started dating

17:37.682 --> 17:39.350
and I fell in love
with him,

17:39.934 --> 17:41.811
uh, but we,

17:41.811 --> 17:44.730
we weren't having
a lot of sex, you know,

17:45.147 --> 17:46.566
and then I find out

17:47.066 --> 17:48.609
that he's cheating on me

17:48.609 --> 17:50.444
with half
of his improv group.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.905
I lost him twice,

17:52.905 --> 17:53.990
in one night.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.908
I lost my boyfriend,

17:56.826 --> 17:58.119
and I lost
my best friend.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.497
I'm sorry.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.292
You deserve way better
than that.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.134
I should probably go
take a shower.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.427
I reek.

<i>You okay? Did you punch him?</i>

18:33.362 --> 18:34.947
No, it's, uh...

18:34.947 --> 18:37.325
it's actually
pretty great.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.659
Stasia: <i>Really?</i>

18:39.744 --> 18:41.329

18:42.038 --> 18:45.541

Suck‐up Sammy...

19:31.128 --> 19:32.129
that's funny.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.159
Did you sleep okay?

20:02.993 --> 20:04.995
Mm, I was
kinda lonely, but...

20:11.669 --> 20:13.003
(cell phone buzzes)

20:17.633 --> 20:19.093
(buzzes)

20:23.139 --> 20:24.306
Is everything okay?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.976
Holy shit, it's past ten.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.645
We should probably,
uh, call the garage.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.813
See if the car is ready.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.440
I mean, if we want
to make it home

20:32.440 --> 20:33.566
in time for the party.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.115
Sam: Not much
has changed, huh?

20:42.158 --> 20:43.659
Harry:
That's not true.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.995
There's an Applebee's where
the Fuddruckers used to be.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.455
(Sam chuckles)

20:47.997 --> 20:49.123
Sam: Oh, here we are.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.837
‐Hey, listen.
‐Yep.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.840
I really am sorry

20:57.840 --> 21:00.634
about being such
a dick during school.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.220
You're pretty awesome.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.891
So I was gonna
head back Monday.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.143
I was thinking
about leaving early,

21:09.143 --> 21:10.478
‐don't want
to hit rush hour.
‐(door opens)

21:13.355 --> 21:16.108
‐Who's that?
‐Harry: That's Lydia.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.652
Your ex. She came.

21:18.861 --> 21:22.072
I guess now she's more
like my ex‐ex.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.659
You're... back together.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.953
Yeah, she, uh,
texted this morning.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.830
Said she was sorry

21:29.830 --> 21:31.499
and she wanted
to work it out

21:32.082 --> 21:34.376
and that she was
already driving over
to meet me, so...

21:36.212 --> 21:37.087
(squeals)

21:37.922 --> 21:38.756
Lydia: Hi, baby.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.466
See you back
at school?

21:44.136 --> 21:45.054
(car door closes)

21:49.141 --> 21:51.477
‐Lydia: I missed you...
‐Harry: I missed you too.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.071
‐(club music playing)
‐(indistinct chatter)

22:02.071 --> 22:03.906
Stasia: So I told him
it was over.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.658
You broke up
with him?

22:05.658 --> 22:08.244
Break‐up implies we had some
sort of commitment to break,

22:08.244 --> 22:10.579
which we did not,
but yeah.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.623
He was starting to get
all needy and possessive.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.459
Gary... was getting
possessive?

22:16.001 --> 22:18.546
He insisted on taking me
out tonight, for one thing.

22:18.546 --> 22:21.465
I don't think wanting
to take your girlfriend
of three‐plus years

22:21.465 --> 22:24.176
out on Valentine's Day
qualifies as being possessive.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.803
He knew I had plans
with you.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.763
What, to go to
a Singles Only party?

22:27.763 --> 22:28.931
Stasia: Yeah, exactly.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.599
(Sam sighs)
You're okay?

22:30.599 --> 22:31.725
Totally!

22:31.725 --> 22:33.227
I'm relieved,
to be honest.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.479
You know me. Relationships
just aren't my thing.

22:35.479 --> 22:36.814
Except for that
you've been in one

22:36.814 --> 22:38.774
almost the entire time
I've known you.

22:38.774 --> 22:39.984
Mmm.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.987
(club music playing)

22:50.119 --> 22:53.122
(music continues)

22:58.085 --> 22:58.919
Bry!

22:59.336 --> 23:00.254
Bryan!

23:01.130 --> 23:02.214
Hey, girl!

23:02.506 --> 23:03.799
Hey, real girl!

23:04.758 --> 23:05.759
Hey.

23:06.468 --> 23:09.638
Two Solo cups
for two solos.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.056
Get it.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.475
‐Cheers, queers.
‐Cheers!

23:15.811 --> 23:16.979
Ohh!

23:18.022 --> 23:19.189
Most of the hot guys
have congregated

23:19.189 --> 23:20.983
to the
queer pong table.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.235
That's beer pong for...
You get it.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.863
Anyway, that's where
you'll have the best luck

23:25.863 --> 23:28.240
unless you're into
the ladies.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.327
Ohh, just your basic
straight girl unfortunately.

23:31.327 --> 23:32.995
Queer pong
it is, then.

23:32.995 --> 23:35.456
Don't worry. There's plenty
of straight meat over there too.

23:35.456 --> 23:36.999
Okay, let's go.
Come on.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.292
Thanks, Bryan.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.172
So apparently,
there's a million
single people in Chicago,

23:43.172 --> 23:44.715
and I still can't
get a date.

23:44.715 --> 23:45.758
Oh, you can get
a date.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.092
You're just
too scared to try.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.136
I'm not scared,
I'm picky.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.638
Picky is just
an excuse

23:50.638 --> 23:52.306
so you don't have
to put yourself out there.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.475
‐Not true.
‐Really?

23:54.475 --> 23:56.393
Okay, then you know what?
I'm gonna pick out some guys,

23:56.393 --> 23:57.478
and you're going
to go talk to them.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.147
‐Fine.
‐(laughing) Oh!

24:01.732 --> 24:03.609
What about...

24:04.151 --> 24:05.194
him?

24:05.486 --> 24:06.904
Oh, who, Toucan Sam?

24:07.404 --> 24:09.573
You know what they say
about big noses.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.075
‐Big boogers.
‐Ugh!

24:11.075 --> 24:12.451
You're gross. Okay.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.871
Fine. What about...

24:16.205 --> 24:17.164
him.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.042
Sam: Oh,
the lost Kardashian brother?

24:20.501 --> 24:23.462
I guarantee you
that his camera roll is

24:23.462 --> 24:26.298
95 percent pictures
of himself.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.634
Okay, fine, Mr. Picky.

24:29.051 --> 24:31.470
What about...

24:31.971 --> 24:32.972
Overalls?

24:33.472 --> 24:34.723
He's totally
your type.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.142
Honestly, with a body
like that,

24:37.142 --> 24:38.477
if he's not
good enough for you,

24:38.477 --> 24:40.312
he is definitely
good enough for me.

24:44.525 --> 24:45.943
Oh shit!

24:45.943 --> 24:47.695
‐Sam!
‐Can we get out of here?

24:47.695 --> 24:49.446
‐Harry: Sam!
‐Why? Who is that?
You want me to beat him up?

24:49.446 --> 24:51.073
‐No.
‐Suck‐up Sammy!

24:51.865 --> 24:54.076
‐Both: Ohh!
‐Oh, too late.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.328
What's up?
How you been, man?

24:56.328 --> 24:59.289
Good, man!
How about you?

24:59.289 --> 25:01.875
Uh, you know, chillin'
like strawberry fillin'.

25:02.876 --> 25:03.919
Li‐like in a doughnut.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.838
You know, tasty.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.048
I‐I'm kind of wasted.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.216
I'm Harry, by the way.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.884
Oh, I know
who you are.

25:10.884 --> 25:11.969
Yeah?

25:12.636 --> 25:14.805
Well, uh,
who are you?

25:14.805 --> 25:17.474
This is Stasia,
my best friend.

25:17.474 --> 25:18.517
Nice.

25:20.144 --> 25:23.063
So, uh, what are you doing
at a Singles Only party?

25:23.063 --> 25:24.356
I thought you had
a girlfriend.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.567
‐Huh?
‐Your girlfriend. Lydia.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.027
That's her name, right?

25:28.027 --> 25:29.820
Thee one that you had
the big fight with,

25:29.820 --> 25:31.155
so you had to ride
with me back home.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.073
‐And then you guys made up.
‐Yeah.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.658
‐So you ditched me.
‐Uh, whaa...

25:34.658 --> 25:36.535
I didn't ditch you,
my girlfriend showed up.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.494
Whatever.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.329
I'm guessing you guys
aren't still together,

25:39.329 --> 25:40.831
seeing as you
can't remember her name?

25:40.831 --> 25:42.708
Nah, uh, we broke up

25:42.708 --> 25:44.626
before we even
got back to Chicago.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.795
If you'd ever
texted me back

25:46.795 --> 25:47.963
after our road trip,

25:47.963 --> 25:49.131
you might have known that.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.050
Oh, uh...

25:51.050 --> 25:52.676
Yeah, sorry,
I just, um...

25:53.635 --> 25:56.138
I‐I got back to school
and got wrapped up in classes.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.848
‐You know me.
‐So, yeah,

25:57.848 --> 25:59.141
um, after Lynnea...

25:59.141 --> 26:00.976
‐Lydia.
‐Right.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.229
Lydia. Lynnea came after.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.689
Before the first Mike.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.649
Anyway, so let's just say
that I just felt like

26:07.649 --> 26:10.319
I was playing into
the whole pan stereotype,

26:10.319 --> 26:11.528
‐so I‐‐
‐Which is?

26:12.613 --> 26:15.199
That we, you know...
get around.

26:15.199 --> 26:18.660
"Get around." Is that, like,
a nice way of saying "slutty"?

26:18.660 --> 26:20.329
Ah, come on.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.413
I'm a romantic.

26:21.789 --> 26:22.790
You know that.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.876
I'm just looking for Mr...

26:26.543 --> 26:27.795
Mrs...

26:27.795 --> 26:29.129
Person Right.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.090
Bu‐but you know
what they say,

26:31.090 --> 26:33.175
the definition of insanity
is doing the same thing

26:33.175 --> 26:34.468
over and over again

26:34.468 --> 26:35.886
and expecting
a different result,

26:35.886 --> 26:39.056
so... I decided
to pull the plug,

26:39.056 --> 26:40.099
go full monk.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.976
No more dating.
Totally celibate.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.522
You... are celibate?

26:49.566 --> 26:50.442
For how long?

26:51.485 --> 26:52.694
Okay, it's only been
a couple of days.

26:53.403 --> 26:54.822
I'm serious
about this.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.783
‐What?
‐Um...

26:57.783 --> 26:59.326
‐What?
‐You know what?

27:00.327 --> 27:02.246
‐Stasia?
‐Oh my God!

27:02.663 --> 27:03.914
I'm gonna get
a refill

27:04.581 --> 27:05.666
or some embalming fluid.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.626
Because that would be
less strong. My God!

27:08.544 --> 27:09.461
Ugh!

27:12.840 --> 27:16.343
Okay. So if you're so serious
about not dating,

27:16.343 --> 27:17.594
why are you at this party?

27:17.594 --> 27:19.805
Oh yeah,
my friends dragged me.

27:19.805 --> 27:20.889
Oh.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.933
Plus I've been painting
my new apartment,

27:22.933 --> 27:24.643
and I needed something
to clean the paintbrushes.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.315
So, uh, what have you
been up to

27:30.315 --> 27:32.025
since graduation?

27:33.026 --> 27:34.570
I'm, um...

27:36.029 --> 27:37.865
working for
Nadia Custo.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.326
Should I know
who that is?

27:41.994 --> 27:43.412
I don't know,
did you date her?

27:44.621 --> 27:46.081
No, she's running
for mayor.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.875
She's a,
a real progressive,

27:47.875 --> 27:50.794
and it's part of my job
to make sure people like you

27:50.794 --> 27:52.004
know who she is.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.756
So you're, like, in charge
of PR or something?

27:54.756 --> 27:56.800
Uh... no, I just started.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.677
I'm one of her
community organizers.

27:58.677 --> 28:02.389
It's basically like
one step up from volunteers.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.807
Hey, no need
to be embarrassed.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.559
I'm folding shirts
these days.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.853
Well, that's...
is that, um...

28:08.478 --> 28:10.564
Is that‐‐ Sorry, you never
actually told me your major.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.232
Was it retail

28:12.232 --> 28:14.818
or, um... fashion?

28:15.861 --> 28:17.195
Is that so hard
to believe?

28:17.195 --> 28:18.405
Kinda.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.075
Uh, no. I, I didn't
major in fashion.

28:22.492 --> 28:25.454
I majored in something
much more important than that.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.663
‐Huh?
‐Marketing.

28:26.663 --> 28:27.706
Uh...

28:29.249 --> 28:31.293
‐What, are you judging me...
‐Mn‐mn.

28:31.293 --> 28:33.295
‐...Mr. Politics.
‐Not at all.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.505
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
you are. I can tell.

28:35.505 --> 28:37.174
What do you think
politics is, anyway?

28:37.716 --> 28:40.719
It's just marketing
the same candidate
different ways.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.638
They are not
all the same.

28:42.638 --> 28:45.515
Nadia Custo wants healthcare
for everybody.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.851
She wants more money
for public education.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.311
She's even looking
at a plan right now

28:49.311 --> 28:51.104
to get cars out of
the downtown core.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.856
Talk about a game changer!

28:52.856 --> 28:54.441
‐Settle down, AOC.
‐Oh!

28:54.441 --> 28:55.484
I, I believe you.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.365
(dance music playing)

29:05.577 --> 29:07.245
You're seriously
not dating right now?

29:10.666 --> 29:12.501
Okay, I should
probably go, uh...

29:13.210 --> 29:15.712
check on Stasia,
make sure she's not
terrorizing anyone.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.714
Oh, uh, okay.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.591
Yeah, and I'll get
some more of this

29:19.591 --> 29:21.051
uh, you know,
paintbrush cleaner.

29:21.051 --> 29:22.970
Yeah, I'll take another one
if you're going.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.681
Uh, okay. Uh, yeah.
Sure, I got you.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.016
Hurry back.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.233
Oh my God!

29:36.233 --> 29:37.484
He's adorable.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.903
How come in all the millions
of times you've told me

29:39.903 --> 29:41.863
the story of
the road trip from hell,

29:41.863 --> 29:43.740
you never mentioned
how fricking hot he is.

29:43.740 --> 29:44.992
Sam: I don't know.

29:44.992 --> 29:46.618
You should be
all over that.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.371
He's not dating now.

29:49.371 --> 29:50.497
Oh please.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.749
He's basically begging you
to give him a reason

29:52.749 --> 29:54.292
to break his vow
of chastity.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.546
If I've learned one thing
from politics,

29:57.546 --> 30:00.048
it's that you can't
make someone vote
for your candidate

30:00.048 --> 30:01.675
if they're not going
to the polls at all.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.177
You're not running
for office.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.804
You are trying
to get laid.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.056
You know me.
I don't do the,

30:08.056 --> 30:10.851
you know, casual
one night thing very well.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.561
Sure.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.022
But you're never gonna get
to a second night

30:15.022 --> 30:17.482
if you don't do
the first one, Samwich.

30:17.941 --> 30:20.736
Now get back out there
and throw yourself

30:20.736 --> 30:22.738
at that hot piece
of man‐ass

30:22.738 --> 30:24.990
before I call your mom
and tell her you quit therapy.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.074
(gasps)

30:26.992 --> 30:28.035
‐Fine.
‐(Stasia giggles)

30:28.785 --> 30:29.619
Wait.

30:33.123 --> 30:34.666
‐No. No‐‐
‐No, it's coming off.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.126
‐It's coming off.
‐Okay, okay, okay.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.070

31:06.198 --> 31:08.867

Yeah, sure.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.427

31:27.427 --> 31:29.387

31:30.138 --> 31:31.973
Thanks, I think.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.688
Did you just...

31:38.688 --> 31:40.732
Are you flirting
with that guy?

31:41.191 --> 31:42.359
What? No.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.360
Yes, you were.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.903
You just gave him
one of these.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.321
‐I‐‐
‐I mean, I get it.

31:46.321 --> 31:47.572
He's super hot.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.032
You should totally
ask him out.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.492
That wasn't flirting.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.035
Look, I don't care.

31:52.035 --> 31:54.037
Just own up to it,
Mr. Celibate.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.330
I wasn't flirting.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.541
Look, I'm not gonna
fight you on it...

31:58.542 --> 31:59.626
but you definitely did.

31:59.626 --> 32:00.794
Okay, you're acting
like a freak.

32:00.794 --> 32:02.504
Is there something
you wanna say?

32:02.963 --> 32:04.256
I'm not a freak.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.883
You're a freak.
You're a freak

32:06.883 --> 32:09.094
who can't keep
his horse in the barn.

32:09.803 --> 32:11.096
Is that right, Grampa?

32:11.096 --> 32:13.765
Well, at least I'm not afraid
to ride a horse.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.101
‐Wow!
‐Mmm.

32:16.685 --> 32:20.355
Well, that's better
than being the rodeo clown.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.149
What does that even mean?

32:22.149 --> 32:23.358
I think you know.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.277
Hey, uh, I'm gonna
get out of here.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.528
I just had sex
with this guy,

32:26.528 --> 32:27.988
and he's waiting
in the bathroom for round two

32:27.988 --> 32:29.114
and I just don't
have it in me.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.490
Great. I'll come with.

32:30.490 --> 32:31.700
Nothing keeping me here.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.515
Hey, we gotta leave soon.
You need to get ready.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.185
What is it, black tie
or something? I'm ready.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.228
You might wanna
put on some pants.

33:01.021 --> 33:02.272
Hey, you're the one
in a towel.

33:02.272 --> 33:03.481
Go get ready.

33:03.481 --> 33:06.109
Harry, we both know you're
gonna wait until the last sec

33:06.109 --> 33:07.903
and then rip on some pants
super fast, but then

33:07.903 --> 33:09.362
you're gonna want
to check your hair

33:09.362 --> 33:10.530
and you're gonna
spend 20 minutes

33:10.530 --> 33:12.199
making it look like
you didn't check your hair.

33:12.199 --> 33:13.408
So get off the game‐‐

33:13.408 --> 33:14.534
Quit riding me, Zach.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.203
I just wanna finish
the campaign, okay.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.329
First of all...

33:18.163 --> 33:19.414
you wish I was
riding you.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.667
Yo, I love it when you get
all dom with me.

33:22.667 --> 33:23.960
You need to get laid.

33:24.669 --> 33:25.879
Get ready. Now!

33:32.427 --> 33:33.261
Sorry, boys.

33:33.678 --> 33:34.638
Where were we?

33:34.638 --> 33:35.555
Zach: Harry!

33:36.139 --> 33:37.641
So who organized this again?

33:38.308 --> 33:39.434
My niece.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.645
Oh yeah. It starts
at 8:00, right?

33:41.645 --> 33:42.812
We should make it.

33:43.980 --> 33:46.066
Sorry. It's just the campaign
is really ramping up,

33:46.066 --> 33:47.817
what with the primaries
next month.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.612
You know, she asked us
not to be late, Sam.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.198
Uh, Usain Dolt,
can we chill?

33:53.198 --> 33:54.950
Eat my dingleberries.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.409
That was rude!

33:56.409 --> 33:58.662
No, making me late for
my girlfriend's trivia night,

33:58.662 --> 33:59.829
that's rude!

33:59.829 --> 34:02.082
Dude, you really need to start
meditating or something.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.292
This kinda stress isn't good
for your heart.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.549
See? Right on time.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.844
She really wants to make sure
we win this week,

34:14.844 --> 34:16.137
so she's brought in
a couple ringers

34:16.137 --> 34:17.931
to handle all the stuff
that none of us know.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.183
‐Like what?
‐Art and politics.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.476
‐Uh‐huh.
‐Oh wait.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.851
‐They're here.
‐Who?

34:22.851 --> 34:25.105
My uncle Paul
and his boyfriend Sam.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.400
Shit! Can we go?

34:30.025 --> 34:31.444
‐What? Why?
‐It's just that, um...

34:31.777 --> 34:34.030
I'm not feeling
especially trivial right now.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.364
Oh my gosh, relax.

34:35.364 --> 34:36.449
Come on, Sam.
Let's do this.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.993
‐Hey.
‐Hey!

34:37.993 --> 34:40.120
Good to see you.
(kisses)

34:40.120 --> 34:41.579
You remember Zach,
Uncle Paul.

34:41.579 --> 34:42.664
‐Of course I do.
‐Good to see you.

34:42.664 --> 34:43.956
And, um,
this is Sam.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.458
Sam, this is
my boyfriend Zach.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.710
Oh, and this is Harry,
his roommate.

34:48.043 --> 34:48.920
Hi.

34:49.337 --> 34:52.590
<i>Okay, folks, we have</i>
<i>seven killer teams</i>

34:52.590 --> 34:54.634

<i>Trivia To the Death.</i>

34:54.634 --> 34:55.927
<i>So grab your seat.</i>
<i>We're about to start.</i>

34:55.927 --> 34:58.054
Is that Harry,
Harry from the road trip?

34:58.680 --> 35:00.265
Oh God. I didn't know.

35:00.265 --> 35:01.641
‐I'm so sorry, babe.
‐It's okay.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.146
Paul: So, how's my sister?

35:06.146 --> 35:08.189
So you're dating
Nancy Fancy Pants, huh?

35:08.857 --> 35:10.567
His name is Paul,
thank you,

35:10.567 --> 35:11.735
and he's really great.

35:12.569 --> 35:15.030
I can't help it
if he's super smart

35:15.030 --> 35:17.616
and super handsome
and a super successful
art dealer.

35:19.576 --> 35:20.660
And so what if I am...

35:21.494 --> 35:22.412
dating him?

35:23.163 --> 35:23.997
Why do you care?

35:24.664 --> 35:26.124
If I'd known you were
into rich old guys,

35:26.124 --> 35:27.709
I would have introduced you
to my grandfather.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.377
That's super ageist.

35:30.086 --> 35:31.421
At least I'm not
a man‐whore.

35:31.421 --> 35:33.381
Excuse me. I've been
celibate for several...

35:34.883 --> 35:36.384
days this year.

35:38.303 --> 35:39.763
So where are you working
these days?

35:39.763 --> 35:41.056
Still folding shirts
for a living?

35:41.514 --> 35:43.391
As a matter of fact,
I am not.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.185
‐Really?
‐Hmm?

35:45.185 --> 35:46.269
What are you doing?

35:47.062 --> 35:49.606
I'm, I'm in
telecommunications.

35:49.606 --> 35:51.316
‐Oh yeah?
‐Mm‐hmm.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.734
Who you working for?

35:52.734 --> 35:56.321
I'm selling phones
at a kiosk on the Pier.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.989
Now can you be
quiet, please?

35:57.989 --> 35:59.115
They're starting.

35:59.115 --> 36:02.994
<i>Okay, folks. Now we know</i>
<i>how this works, right?</i>

36:02.994 --> 36:05.955
<i>This first team to ring</i>

<i>That is wrong,</i>

37:16.651 --> 37:17.944
<i>Okay, folks, so that means</i>

37:19.988 --> 37:22.031

37:24.033 --> 37:26.244

37:26.244 --> 37:27.495
<i>And the category is...</i>

37:28.204 --> 37:30.039
<i>Art History.</i>

37:30.498 --> 37:33.418
<i>Okay. This artist's</i>
<i>scandalous painting</i>

37:33.418 --> 37:35.795
<i>of a woman</i>
<i>nearly derailed his career</i>

37:35.795 --> 37:39.174

37:41.634 --> 37:43.178
‐(bell dings)
‐Toulouse Lautrec!

37:43.178 --> 37:44.888
Emcee: <i>Good guess!</i>

37:44.888 --> 37:47.640
<i>Team Five, you have 30 seconds</i>

37:47.640 --> 37:49.225

37:49.225 --> 37:50.602
It's Matisse. It's Matisse.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.687
Mmm, no, it's not.

37:52.687 --> 37:53.646
It's Sargent.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.523
This is my business.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.192
It's Matisse.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.526
It's a painting
he did of his wife.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.862
I'm telling you,
it's John Singer Sargent.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.864
<i>‐Madame X.</i>
‐Emcee: <i>Twenty seconds.</i>

38:02.864 --> 38:04.407
How the hell
do you know that?

38:04.407 --> 38:07.035
He also did a bunch
of drawings of naked dudes.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.287
I stole a book about him
from the library

38:09.287 --> 38:10.705
so I could
whack off to it.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.707
And sometimes
after I was finished,

38:12.707 --> 38:14.793
I would, you know,
read it.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.254
Okay, I say we go
with Uncle Paul.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.799
‐Paul: Yeah.
‐Uh, no way. Harry's right.

38:20.799 --> 38:21.800
He whacks off a lot.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.759
‐Emcee: <i>Ten seconds.</i>
‐Zach: I vote Harry.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.470
Okay, um, Sam,

38:25.470 --> 38:26.638
you get
the deciding vote.

38:26.638 --> 38:27.972
Wh... uh!

38:28.473 --> 38:30.350
Sam, are you serious
right now?

38:30.809 --> 38:33.144
You really think that
this pair of shoulders

38:33.144 --> 38:34.729
knows more
about art history

38:34.729 --> 38:35.688
than I do!

38:38.650 --> 38:39.692
Come on.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.989
Harry! I say
we go with Harry!

38:44.989 --> 38:46.658
John Singer Sargent!

38:47.242 --> 38:48.493
<i>That is correct.</i>

38:48.493 --> 38:50.245
‐(all cheering)
‐Emcee: <i>Congratulations.</i>

38:50.245 --> 38:51.579

38:53.039 --> 38:54.123
Ah! I...

38:55.458 --> 38:56.709
Congrats, everyone.

38:56.709 --> 38:57.877
Sam, let's go.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.091
Actually, I think
I'm gonna stay.

39:03.091 --> 39:03.967
You know what?

39:04.425 --> 39:05.760
You are a child!

39:05.760 --> 39:06.886
Goodbye.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.517
My mother
never liked him, anyway.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.144
Ohh!

39:23.444 --> 39:24.904
Harry:
"You are a child!"

39:24.904 --> 39:27.282
‐Sam: He's not British.
‐Harry: Are you sure?

39:27.282 --> 39:28.992
What's it say
on his passport?

39:28.992 --> 39:30.076
Pretentious?

39:30.076 --> 39:31.286
Is that
a nationality?

39:33.413 --> 39:34.998
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to...

39:35.498 --> 39:36.916
‐I know you liked him.
‐No,

39:36.916 --> 39:38.293
not really, I just...

39:38.668 --> 39:41.546
You know, you get
what you settle for.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.089
You know
what I mean?

39:44.132 --> 39:46.551
Plus his apartment
was sick!

39:46.551 --> 39:47.677
‐Harry: Was it?
‐Sam: Yeah.

39:47.677 --> 39:49.387
Anyway, you guys
get a table,

39:49.387 --> 39:50.972
‐I'm gonna say hi to Stasia.
‐I know. Great.

39:52.348 --> 39:55.059
Well, well, well,
look who the hell it is.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.311
Both: Mwah!

39:56.311 --> 39:57.812
This is a surprise.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.398
You haven't been here once
since you started dating Paul.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.357
Yeah.

40:01.357 --> 40:02.525
Well, except that
one time,

40:02.525 --> 40:04.944
he had an allergic reaction
to the soap in the bathroom

40:04.944 --> 40:06.112
and you had to leave.

40:06.613 --> 40:07.697
Yeah.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.365
Where is
His Royal Highness?

40:10.199 --> 40:11.367
I think...

40:12.118 --> 40:13.202
that we broke up.

40:13.995 --> 40:14.829
For real?

40:16.164 --> 40:17.206
For real.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.500
Oh, thank God!

40:19.500 --> 40:20.627
Ohh!

40:20.627 --> 40:23.046
I am sorry, Samwich,
I hated him.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.298
‐I know!
‐He was literally the worst.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.383
Well, he was great
in bed.

40:27.842 --> 40:28.718
He was?

40:29.969 --> 40:30.803
No.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.223
Hi, Nick!

40:34.933 --> 40:38.019
Oh my God.
He's here all the time.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.312
That's so sweet.

40:39.312 --> 40:41.189
It's not sweet.
It's stalkery.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.858
It's not stalkery
when you're dating.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.443
We are not dating. We're...

40:46.361 --> 40:47.487
hanging out.

40:47.487 --> 40:48.696
Well, you've been
hanging out

40:48.696 --> 40:49.739
for six months.

40:49.739 --> 40:50.865
You're ridiculous.

40:52.992 --> 40:54.327
Oh my God,
Harry's here.

40:54.327 --> 40:55.536
What is going on?

40:55.536 --> 40:57.497
We ran into
each other tonight.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.624
It's a long story.
The main thing is

40:59.624 --> 41:01.668
that I realized
my mistake all along

41:01.668 --> 41:03.920
was thinking that we could
ever be more than friends.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.297
As long as we keep it

41:06.297 --> 41:08.007
in the friend zone,
we're good.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.093
He's fun...

41:10.718 --> 41:13.262
and funny, and he's
actually pretty smart,

41:13.262 --> 41:15.056
which for some reason,
I never knew, but...

41:15.765 --> 41:18.601
he's definitely
not boyfriend material.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.395
I need someone grown up.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.355
You know what I mean?
And that's not Harry.

41:23.856 --> 41:25.775
Okay, got it.
Harry it ain't.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.777
Harry it ain't.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.613
Now can you do your job
like a good little bar wench

41:30.613 --> 41:31.864
and fetch me
four beers.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.243
You're so into him.

41:35.618 --> 41:36.911
I am not.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.162
Bro, what are you
talking about?

41:38.162 --> 41:39.622
Dude, you're staring
at him.

41:39.622 --> 41:42.166
No, I was staring
in his direction

41:42.166 --> 41:45.086
because I haven't seen
Stasia in a while,

41:45.086 --> 41:46.337
and I wanted
to wave hello.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.382
Which is something
a Neanderthal like yourself

41:49.382 --> 41:51.134
would never knew is that

41:51.134 --> 41:52.510
that is the
courteous thing to do.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.096
Yeah, well, you've,
you've always been
very courteous.

41:55.388 --> 41:56.639
I am.

41:56.639 --> 41:59.225
Dude, you literally farted
at the dinner table last night.

42:00.309 --> 42:02.311
That was
a medical condition.

42:02.311 --> 42:04.439
Yeah.
You're full of shit.

42:04.439 --> 42:06.899
Just like you are now, dude.
I know you.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.693
Zach, shut your gob
before I tell April

42:08.693 --> 42:10.319
what I saw on your computer
this morning.

42:10.319 --> 42:11.487
What?

42:11.487 --> 42:12.947
Okay, we're just friends, man.

42:13.281 --> 42:15.366
Like, let it go.
For real.

42:15.700 --> 42:16.701
For real for real?

42:17.076 --> 42:18.036
For real.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.912
First round's
on Stasia!

42:20.872 --> 42:22.123
To celebrate
my breakup.

42:23.916 --> 42:24.834
Stasia.

42:25.126 --> 42:26.335
‐Thank you.
‐Mwah!

42:27.045 --> 42:29.005
‐See? Courteous.
‐April: Yeah.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.090
‐To Sam's breakup.
‐April: Hmm.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.842
All: To Sam's breakup.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.446
(crowd cheering)

46:22.446 --> 46:25.866
Drag Queen:
<i>Happy Pride, Chicago!</i>

46:26.826 --> 46:28.828
<i>How is everybody</i>
<i>feeling tonight?</i>

46:28.828 --> 46:30.538
(cheering)

46:30.538 --> 46:32.623
Drag Queen:
<i>Can you feel the love?</i>

46:32.873 --> 46:35.293
<i>'Cause that's what it's</i>
<i>all about, right? Love.</i>

46:35.293 --> 46:37.795
<i>Everybody wants it.</i>
<i>Everybody needs it.</i>

46:37.795 --> 46:40.256
<i>So why aren't we</i>
<i>giving it away?</i>

46:40.256 --> 46:41.632
‐Whoo!
‐(crowd cheering)

46:41.632 --> 46:42.591
Drag Queen:
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

46:42.591 --> 46:44.302
<i>Find you some love tonight.</i>

46:44.885 --> 46:46.470
<i>Or at least get you</i>
<i>some ass.</i>

46:46.470 --> 46:48.514
(club music resumes)

46:53.477 --> 46:54.437
What?

46:57.231 --> 46:59.400
S‐so did you mean
that thing you said?

46:59.775 --> 47:02.945
About how when guys
become friends,

47:02.945 --> 47:04.572
they can never be
anything more than that?

47:05.323 --> 47:07.575
One billion percent.

47:07.575 --> 47:09.702
You either end up
having bad sex

47:09.702 --> 47:11.954
or ruining
the friendship, or both.

47:11.954 --> 47:13.456
And there's
no exceptions?

47:13.456 --> 47:15.291
Like, ever?

47:16.250 --> 47:18.210
None. Zero.

47:19.462 --> 47:20.755
No even for...

47:22.298 --> 47:23.466
you and me?

47:25.468 --> 47:27.178
Not even you and me.

47:29.096 --> 47:32.058
Like I'm going to date the guy
who bails on relationship

47:32.058 --> 47:34.643
faster than my parents' dog
eats cat poop.

47:37.813 --> 47:40.566
Oh my God,
I love this song!

47:40.858 --> 47:43.861

48:58.811 --> 49:01.564
Casey:
Um, when did you become
the world's laziest roommate?

49:02.690 --> 49:03.858
Don't worry. I'll get it.

49:04.275 --> 49:05.818
Oh. Harry's here.

49:06.652 --> 49:07.528
(door opens)

49:07.528 --> 49:09.572
‐Hi, Harry.
‐Harry: Hey.

49:09.572 --> 49:10.865
‐Casey: How're you doing?
‐Harry: What's up?

49:12.074 --> 49:13.200
(door closes)

49:15.286 --> 49:16.287
Hey, Samwich!

49:23.878 --> 49:24.753
What?

49:25.671 --> 49:28.007
You never call me that.
That's Stasia's name for me.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.718
‐Oh, is it?
‐Hmm.

49:31.844 --> 49:33.512
Heh. I guess it is.

49:36.307 --> 49:37.308
Those donuts?

49:44.648 --> 49:48.027
(video game sounds)

49:54.283 --> 49:55.493
Is Harry here?

49:56.952 --> 49:58.871
I thought he was
up there. With you.

50:02.166 --> 50:03.167
Huh.

50:04.627 --> 50:05.586
Whatcha playin'?

50:06.128 --> 50:07.004
Zach: <i>Crackdown 3.</i>

50:07.004 --> 50:08.297
Oh, I love
that game!

50:10.132 --> 50:11.175
Let's get it, girl!

50:16.430 --> 50:17.306
Harry: <i>So listen,</i>

50:17.306 --> 50:19.141
can I tell you
something <i>?</i>

50:19.642 --> 50:20.726
Oh yeah?
What's that?

50:21.352 --> 50:22.645
It's, it's nothing bad.

50:22.645 --> 50:24.480
Oh, I didn't think
it was...

50:25.773 --> 50:28.275
Good. I just,
whenever anyone says,

50:28.275 --> 50:30.694
"We need to talk,"
it's usually
something bad, so...

50:30.694 --> 50:32.321
Oh, well, you didn't.

50:32.321 --> 50:33.322
What?

50:33.322 --> 50:34.907
You didn't say,
"We need to talk."

50:34.907 --> 50:36.367
You said, "I have
to tell you something."

50:38.244 --> 50:39.703
Oh, I, I...
(chuckles)

50:40.454 --> 50:41.705
‐Yes, I did.
‐(chuckles)

50:45.251 --> 50:46.377
So?

50:48.671 --> 50:51.882
So, uh,
Stasia and I...

50:52.633 --> 50:54.843
kinda made out
last night.

50:54.843 --> 50:56.136
Oh wow!

50:56.136 --> 50:57.388
That's... Ooh.

50:57.388 --> 51:00.057
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
At, uh, Pride.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.642
‐Hmm.
‐I hope that's okay.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.143
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

51:04.144 --> 51:05.104
Right.

51:05.688 --> 51:07.648
I mean, I,
I told Stasia that,

51:07.648 --> 51:09.858
but she kinda got
in my head a little bit.

51:09.858 --> 51:12.570
So I, uh, snuck out as soon
as I woke up this morning.

51:15.364 --> 51:16.782
You snuck out
of where?

51:19.285 --> 51:20.661
My bedroom?

51:22.788 --> 51:23.789
Zach: <i>So...</i>

51:24.373 --> 51:26.375
you and Harry have
a good time last night?

51:27.501 --> 51:29.295
As a matter of fact,
we did. Why?

51:29.753 --> 51:30.921
No reason.

51:30.921 --> 51:33.841
Just, uh... I'm glad
it was a fun time

51:33.841 --> 51:36.135
if you're both gonna ruin
your relationships with Sam.

51:37.469 --> 51:39.638
We didn't.
Sam's not gonna care.

51:40.306 --> 51:41.599
I mean, Sam's not
into Harry that way.

51:41.599 --> 51:44.435
He said so.
Like... multiple times.

51:44.810 --> 51:45.894
Okay.

51:47.104 --> 51:48.147
What?

51:49.315 --> 51:50.858
You think
he's gonna be weird?

51:53.986 --> 51:56.614
Stasia... spent the night?

51:57.114 --> 51:58.365
Uh... yeah.

51:58.365 --> 51:59.700
‐And you guys...
‐Uh‐huh.

52:01.785 --> 52:02.745
Cool.

52:05.331 --> 52:08.584
What, you couldn't find any
other randos to hook up with?

52:08.584 --> 52:09.960
So you had to start poaching
from the home team?

52:09.960 --> 52:11.295
Wha... hey,
no, no, no. I...

52:11.295 --> 52:14.798
It wasn't like
another one‐night stand
or anything like that.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.800
No, we didn't just smash
and dash, you know.

52:16.800 --> 52:19.261
We didn't just
sleep together, Zach. Okay.

52:19.970 --> 52:21.764
We actually like
each other, all right.

52:21.764 --> 52:23.849
That's... great!

52:23.849 --> 52:25.893
Yeah, she's really funny

52:25.893 --> 52:27.436
an‐an‐and fun.

52:27.436 --> 52:29.021
He's actually
really smart.

52:29.647 --> 52:31.649
‐Really smart?
‐You know, and he's not
all clingy‐‐

52:31.649 --> 52:33.651
An‐and she's so,
you know...

52:34.193 --> 52:35.361
her own person.

52:35.986 --> 52:36.987
Like you.

52:38.405 --> 52:40.157
I woke up this morning,
and he wasn't even there.

52:40.157 --> 52:41.367
And you liked that?

52:43.118 --> 52:45.496
‐Maybe you two are perfect
for each other.
‐Right?

52:46.538 --> 52:48.123
I mean, how crazy
would it be.

52:48.123 --> 52:50.626
If your two best friends

52:50.626 --> 52:52.753
became, like, a couple.

52:55.255 --> 52:56.507
A couple.

52:56.507 --> 52:57.966
That would be crazy.

53:01.303 --> 53:04.598
Well, I, I should probably
get back to Stasia.

53:04.598 --> 53:05.891
She's gonna wonder
where I am.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.686
Maybe I should take those.

53:08.686 --> 53:11.230
I could tell her
I went to get donuts.

53:14.191 --> 53:15.109
Yeah.

53:15.401 --> 53:16.318
Yeah.

53:23.033 --> 53:23.992
I love you, man.

53:25.327 --> 53:26.245
I love you too.

53:37.715 --> 53:38.716
(door opens)

53:39.842 --> 53:40.926
(door closes)

53:46.265 --> 53:47.349
Who wants mimosas?

53:47.349 --> 53:48.392
All: Me!

53:51.437 --> 53:52.896
I heard you got
a new job?

53:52.896 --> 53:55.023
Yes! Finally!
No more bartending!

54:00.279 --> 54:01.488
So what is it?

54:02.239 --> 54:05.534
Oh, uh, I'm working
for Windy City Beat,

54:05.534 --> 54:07.244
doing all their, like,
alt events and stuff.

54:07.661 --> 54:08.871
Oh great.

54:08.871 --> 54:10.330
Yeah, they wanted someone
to curate a bunch

54:10.330 --> 54:12.541
of cool, non‐touristy stuff
every week, so...

54:13.375 --> 54:14.710
Sam:
Sounds perfect for you.

54:14.710 --> 54:15.836
It is!

54:17.463 --> 54:19.339
And what about you? You still
working down at the Pier?

54:19.339 --> 54:21.800
Uh, no.
God, no, um...

54:22.384 --> 54:25.804
Actually, Stasia got me a job
bar‐backing at G and O.

54:27.806 --> 54:29.391
Wow, nice.

54:30.517 --> 54:32.644
Yeah, but then
she up and left me, so...

54:32.644 --> 54:33.812
I up and left him.

54:35.022 --> 54:36.398
Aw, so sad.

54:36.398 --> 54:38.692
Uh, waitress!
Uh, we're gonna need
a lot more alcohol,

54:38.692 --> 54:40.319
like, right now.

54:40.778 --> 54:42.446
‐Thanks.
‐Oh my God, Zach.

54:42.446 --> 54:43.864
‐Ha ha ha!
‐So stupid.

54:56.043 --> 54:58.212
And I knew
he was lying.

54:58.837 --> 55:02.382
Who would have
improv rehearsal
after midnight?

55:03.383 --> 55:06.136
A lying liar,
that's who.

55:06.678 --> 55:08.972
But Malcolm,
he would never admit

55:08.972 --> 55:10.474
that anything
was going on.

55:10.766 --> 55:11.850
No, no, no.

55:11.850 --> 55:13.310
Not me, he said.

55:13.310 --> 55:16.855
I would never sleep
with Doug or Eddie.

55:16.855 --> 55:17.856
Stasia: Sam.

55:18.482 --> 55:20.025
Why are you talking
about this?

55:20.025 --> 55:21.527
This happened
a long time ago.

55:23.195 --> 55:24.488
And then...

55:25.030 --> 55:27.157
I came home early
one day

55:27.157 --> 55:28.450
and I caught him

55:28.992 --> 55:31.203
in the shower
with Doug.

55:31.203 --> 55:32.579
And Eddie.

55:32.579 --> 55:34.039
There he was.

55:34.331 --> 55:35.541
Malcolm in the Middle.

55:37.125 --> 55:38.293
You know what I mean?

55:40.504 --> 55:41.547
But it's okay.

55:42.214 --> 55:44.466
Just... you gotta move on.

55:45.634 --> 55:46.635
Like Harry.

55:47.469 --> 55:49.513
Harry moves on
all the time.

55:49.846 --> 55:50.973
That's what he does.

55:52.307 --> 55:53.559
Whenever things get...

55:55.394 --> 55:57.145
hairy.
(laughs)

55:57.145 --> 55:58.355
Get it?

55:59.022 --> 56:01.358
As soon as things
get hard,

56:01.358 --> 56:02.693
Harry just

56:02.693 --> 56:04.152
cuts and runs,
you know.

56:04.152 --> 56:06.863
That's just
the thing about Harry.

56:07.906 --> 56:09.241
Cut and run.

56:09.241 --> 56:10.409
Just for fun.

56:10.409 --> 56:12.119
‐Harry's my name.
‐Stasia: Sam.

56:12.119 --> 56:13.370
That's my game.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.371
Sam.

56:15.038 --> 56:16.456
(whispering):
But when he does that,

56:17.374 --> 56:18.375
I'll be here.

56:18.959 --> 56:19.876
For you.

56:20.502 --> 56:21.628
Stasia.

56:22.796 --> 56:24.298
Anastasia.

56:25.757 --> 56:27.676
Anaphylaxis.

56:29.303 --> 56:31.138
See, now that's
a good drag name,

56:31.138 --> 56:32.306
Ana Phylaxis.

56:32.931 --> 56:34.725
One bite
and she'll kill you.

56:37.311 --> 56:40.856
Oh see. Look,
she's in anaphylaxis shock!

56:44.151 --> 56:45.444
You're an asshole.

56:46.862 --> 56:48.030
Oh!

56:49.698 --> 56:50.907
Thanks, man.

57:31.948 --> 57:34.409
Am I to surmise from the fact
that you're sitting here
in the dark

57:34.409 --> 57:36.745
that brunch did not go quite
as you might have liked.

57:37.329 --> 57:39.915
There have been funerals
for children

57:39.915 --> 57:41.708
‐that aren't as awful
as that brunch was.
‐Casey: Oh!

57:41.708 --> 57:44.294
Oh my God,
I'm sorry.

57:45.045 --> 57:46.963
Well, at least you did it.

57:48.298 --> 57:49.549
Good for you.

57:49.966 --> 57:51.093
Good for me.

57:54.346 --> 57:56.223
Hey, have you
heard of, um,

57:56.223 --> 57:58.642
of that new
gay dating app?

57:59.101 --> 58:01.103
Buff or Gruff or...

58:02.270 --> 58:03.230
No.

58:03.689 --> 58:04.981
Why, are you
leaving Eddie?

58:05.607 --> 58:06.858
Looking to spice
things up?

58:06.858 --> 58:08.902
(chuckles)
No, dumbass. For you.

58:09.236 --> 58:11.321
I'm not signing up
for some‐‐

58:11.321 --> 58:13.198
Look, it doesn't have
to be that,

58:13.198 --> 58:16.034
but I did not
March on Washington

58:16.034 --> 58:18.704
and Act‐up and Fight AIDS
for all of those years

58:18.704 --> 58:21.081
so that you
could waste your life,

58:21.081 --> 58:23.417
locked in that
malodorous bedroom,

58:23.417 --> 58:25.961
furiously masturbating
to what can only be described

58:25.961 --> 58:28.755
as moderately shameful
amateur pornography.

58:29.214 --> 58:30.966
And listen,
if you want some privacy,

58:30.966 --> 58:32.467
you need to invest
in headphones.

58:33.301 --> 58:35.554
But I'm worried
about your health.

58:35.887 --> 58:38.140
I mean, my God,
your poor bologna pony

58:38.140 --> 58:39.266
must need a break.

58:39.266 --> 58:40.225
Is it, is it bruised?

58:40.225 --> 58:42.018
‐Or chafed?
‐Okay.

58:42.018 --> 58:43.437
Does it need
arnica ointment‐‐

58:43.437 --> 58:47.524
Okay, I will do...
something.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.526
Just please stop talking
about my penis.

58:49.526 --> 58:50.777
(chuckling)
Fine.

58:54.197 --> 58:55.866
You deserve someone
to love, you know.

58:58.535 --> 58:59.745
And someone
to love you.

59:01.621 --> 59:03.373
And seriously,
if you need arnica,

59:03.373 --> 59:04.708
I have some
right upstairs.

59:04.708 --> 59:05.876
Go!

59:06.626 --> 59:07.586
All right.

59:09.129 --> 59:10.172
But do the dating app.

59:10.630 --> 59:11.631
One date.

59:12.132 --> 59:13.550
Or else I'm raising
your rent.

59:22.476 --> 59:23.935
Sam:
<i>Let's meet at Em's.</i>

59:24.311 --> 59:26.229
<i>I'll be in the fourth booth</i>
<i>from the door,</i>

59:26.229 --> 59:27.773
<i>wearing a green polo.</i>

59:27.773 --> 59:28.899
<i>A blue polo.</i>

59:28.899 --> 59:30.150
<i>A lime polo.</i>

59:30.150 --> 59:31.485
<i>A burnt orange polo.</i>

59:32.194 --> 59:34.738
<i>We can check each other out</i>
<i>and have a drink.</i>

59:34.738 --> 59:36.865
<i>And if we both agree</i>
<i>that the first drink</i>
<i>goes well, well,</i>

59:37.365 --> 59:38.617
<i>we can take it from there.</i>

59:38.617 --> 59:39.534
Hey.

59:41.328 --> 59:42.537
Oh!

59:43.830 --> 59:45.791
Sorry, I, uh,
I think I'm having

59:45.791 --> 59:46.917
an allergic reaction

59:46.917 --> 59:49.169
to... something.

59:50.337 --> 59:53.173
Listen, may be better
we just call it a night.

59:58.053 --> 01:00:00.055
So, now I'm on my third race
for alderman.

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:02.349
I mostly do
volunteer coordination,

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:03.767
get out the vote,
stuff like that.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.018
I work
in politics too!

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:07.562
‐No way.
‐Well, I used to.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:09.898
Now I just help run
the Obamas' local foundation.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.276
You wanna get
outta here?

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:18.365
(both moaning)

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:20.659
<i>♪ I've been thinking</i>
<i>'bout you ♪</i>

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:25.914

Man:

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.459
I mean, you gotta pull
for the underdogs, right?

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.002
That's what I always say.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.464
Uh, ow.

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:35.966
Sorry, you, uh...

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:37.217
you had something
in your hair.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.636
‐Oh, thanks.
‐You were saying.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:40.679
Oh yeah.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:42.514
I like you.

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:43.640
A lot.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.141
I don't like
to take things too fast

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.811
‐before we talk
about monogamy.
‐Yeah, no worries.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.729
‐It's just really not my thing.
‐Once we get serious,
I'm super faithful.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:53.567
Oh!

01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:04.911
Nice to meet you.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.454
It's nice
to meet you too.

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:09.541
I've been on a few
messy ones of these,

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:12.127
so it's nice to meet
someone cool.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.838
You are really handsome.

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:17.299
Wow, thanks.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.217
Back at ya.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.220
I'm sorry. I don't think
I ever got your name?

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:23.847
I'm Sam.

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:25.181
How about you?

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.474
I'm Harry.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.101
I gotta go.

01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:32.439
(sighs)

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:36.192
(beeps)

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:46.620
You're home?

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:47.954
How was it?

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:51.041
‐Not for me.
‐Why not?

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:52.876
Just wasn't.

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:57.130
You keep finding problems
with everyone.

01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:59.132
They can't all be
the wrong guy.

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:01.468
What was he?
Stinky? Wiggy?

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.094
Non‐monogamy‐y?

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:04.095
No.

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:06.681
Harry.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:09.100
Like, super hairy?

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.602
‐Uhh...
‐Like, fuzzy all over?

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:12.604
You know, I used to date
this total sasquatch.

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:15.023
Loved it.
Never needed a blanket.

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:17.275
No. He was great.

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:20.362
Smart, funny, handsome.

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.614
Moderately hirsute.

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:23.865
So?

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:27.035
His name was Harry.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:28.370
Oh.

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:30.580
He wasn't your Harry, huh?

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:33.959
Oh baby.

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:38.463
(sniffles)

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.642
Sam:
Obviously, it's January.

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:52.394
It's too cold
for canvassing.

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:53.853
But we've got
training events

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:55.355
every weekend
from now until March,

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:57.357
when we should be able
to start hitting the streets.

01:02:57.357 --> 01:02:59.150
So, uh,
we're in a good place.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:00.652
Uh, I'll get you
the final volunteer numbers.

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:01.695
Thanks, guys.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.246
Hi.

01:03:12.664 --> 01:03:15.375
(people chattering)

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:20.755
So I'm getting married.

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:23.925
You...

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:25.719
You're, uh...

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.930
Oh my God!
Congratulations!

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.435
Stasia: Look...

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:36.896
I know we haven't been
exactly close the last year.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:40.191
God, what's it been,
like a year and a half?

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:41.192
Well, yeah.

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:43.028
You know what?
It doesn't matter. Anyway, um...

01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:45.655
the thing is...

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.991
I don't really like
a lot of people...

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.493
except you...

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.371
well, and my fiancé,
I guess.

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:54.831
(chuckles)

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:55.832
And, um...

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.585
I just can't imagine
getting married

01:03:58.585 --> 01:03:59.669
without you there.

01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:03.757
I mean, you've been
my best friend since
the first day of college,

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:04.924
and I just...

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:09.137
Is there any chance
you'd be my Man of Honor?

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:12.640
"Man of Honor"?

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:15.310
Uh...

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.604
Is that even a thing?

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:20.398
It is if I say it is.

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:25.862
Is Harry cool with it?

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:28.490
I mean...

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:30.533
I assume so, but...

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.243
Well, don't you think
you should ask him?

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:36.122
Why would...
why would I do that?

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:38.458
Because he's the groom?

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:42.003
Oh no.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:43.880
No, no, no, I'm not...

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.799
No, I'm not...
I'm not marrying Harry.

01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:46.758
I'm marrying Zach.

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:50.011
You... you're...

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:52.097
Zach?

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:53.973
Stasia:
You didn't know?

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:56.643
No! No! No!

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:58.686
(stammering)
I mean, I stopped
following you guys

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:00.146
on social media,
and then I...

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.108
I kinda wondered why
you never got back to me

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:05.235
when I texted you
after Harry and me broke up.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.445
You didn't say that
it was about that.

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:09.864
And then, and then,
you know, I was a little...

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:13.868
embarrassed about the way
that I acted at brunch, but‐‐

01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:15.787
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:17.330
And when I didn't hear
from you.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:18.957
I, I figured you didn't
wanna hear from me,

01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:20.041
‐so...
‐I‐‐

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.043
Oh my God!
I am sorry too.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.212
But then this happened,

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:26.631
and I figured
somebody had to make
the first move. So...

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:33.054
The only reason Harry and I
lasted as long as we did

01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:34.722
is because
we both felt so...

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:38.143
shitty about what
we did to you

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:39.310
that we kind of...

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:42.689
had to make it work,
you know.

01:05:43.815 --> 01:05:45.692
Well, that and we did really
want to prove you wrong

01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:48.153
after all that nasty stuff
you said at brunch, but

01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:51.030
mostly, we felt like...

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.742
if we ruined our friendships
with you...

01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:57.036
it had to be love.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:00.415
Only... it wasn't.

01:06:03.835 --> 01:06:05.837
And I finally realized

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:08.631
that every time I was going
over to their apartment,

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.342
the person I was hoping
would open the door was...

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:14.888
Zach.

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:18.349
And I tried to fight it.
I mean, I really did.

01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:20.643
Zach is so straight
and average.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.478
You know how
I feel about that.

01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:27.358
I don't know.

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:29.194
I just...

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:33.198
I just love him so much.

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:38.077
And the gravitational
pull of that is

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:40.663
so much greater
than any ideas

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.874
I had about myself
or my life.

01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:46.252
So...

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:49.547
what do you think?

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:55.720
Will Harry be there?

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.598
Oh no. No, he's, like,
really mad at us.

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:02.101
Yes.

01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:03.645
Yeah, I would be honored.

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:04.938
‐When is it?
‐Oh!

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.816
Valentine's Day.

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:10.902
‐Ugh. Isn't that gross?
‐Oh ho ho!

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:13.613
But Zach's parents got married
on Valentine's Day,

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:15.031
and it was important
to him, so...

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:16.991
But don't worry, okay.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.534
We're not doing
a rehearsal dinner

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:19.869
or bachelorette party

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.246
or shower
or anything like that.

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.248
‐(elevator bell dings)
<i>‐Just a simple party</i>

01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:24.582
<i>that night.</i>

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:41.516
Wow!

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:42.976
‐(Stasia giggles)
‐You look amazing.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:44.310
You like?

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.771
A twist on the traditional.
Like me!

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.273
‐(laughs)
‐I love it.

01:07:51.693 --> 01:07:53.569
I'm so happy
you're here.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:05.498
You said
he wasn't coming.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.001
I lied.

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:23.975
(people chattering)

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:31.691
Sorry to ambush you.

01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:33.151
I, uh...

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:34.777
asked Stasia
to embellish a little

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.863
'cause I didn't think
you'd come

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:38.363
if you knew
I was gonna be here.

01:08:40.198 --> 01:08:41.367
It's good to see you.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:43.661
I've missed you.

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:48.957
Can you believe that
Stasia is getting married

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.376
on Valentine's Day?

01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:53.712
She likes to think
that she's so edgy,

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:55.006
but let's face it,

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:56.716
she basic.

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:57.633
Yeah.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:00.928
It's, um...

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:03.805
big of you to be here,

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:05.390
after everything
that happened.

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:08.519
Uh, not really.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.189
I mean, I was never
in love with Stasia.

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:15.359
I love her. I just...

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:18.363
Mostly I'm just glad
she's happy.

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.283
So how come
you never called me

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:24.535
if you missed me
so much?

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:27.705
I mean, it's not like
I blocked your number
or anything.

01:09:28.663 --> 01:09:30.375
I guess I figured
you wouldn't wanna
talk to me.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.795
Or that I didn't deserve
to see you again.

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.006
I mean, you made it
pretty clear

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.256
how badly I hurt you.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:45.264
Well, uh, I should
probably get a drink.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.184
It's good to see you.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.898
The only reason
anything happened with Stasia

01:09:53.898 --> 01:09:55.024
was 'cause...

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:57.694
'cause I was trying
to get over you.

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:02.407
Why would you need
to do that?

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:09.163
Ever since, uh,
that trip home...

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:12.959
ever since
we became friends...

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:17.213
I guess I kinda wanted
something more.

01:10:19.257 --> 01:10:20.675
And then at Pride...

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:22.468
remember that?

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:27.098
I was just trying
to work up the nerve
to tell you

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:28.891
that I was in love
with you,

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:32.895
but you made it
really, really clear

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.480
that nothing was
ever gonna happen.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.065
Because you
never said anything!

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.316
I know.

01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:39.235
And then I ruined
everything.

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:43.906
The worst part is that

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:46.993
you were my favorite person
in the world...

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:51.122
and in one night,
I lost you twice.

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:52.707
I, um...

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:55.835
I, um...

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:57.587
was?

01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.380
Past tense?

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:02.675
You said that I was
your favorite person.

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.512
No, stupid.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.806
You are.

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:10.850
Always will be.

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:15.021
You are the smartest,
funniest,

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:18.232
strangest person
I have ever met,

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.485
and I love everything
about you.

01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:24.238
I love that you need
to control everything...

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:29.202
and that you don't trust
a cashier to give you
the right change.

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:30.328
Well...

01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:33.080
I love that you
never forget anything

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:36.626
and that you need to explain
half of your jokes to me.

01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:40.338
And I even love
how crazy I make you,

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:43.132
'cause I know that means
I matter to you.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.176
And...

01:11:46.928 --> 01:11:49.972
mattering to you is
kinda all I ever wanted.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.806

I guess Suck‐up Sammy wasn't

01:15:21.225 --> 01:15:22.476
Stop!

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:31.694
Don't do that.
Don't...

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:34.071
look at me like that.

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.823
Don't make me right.

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:37.616
Right?

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:39.952
About what?

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.371
About this! About...

01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:46.083
how we shouldn't
have done this.

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:47.001
Hey, no, no.

01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:49.670
Last night was perfect.

01:15:50.337 --> 01:15:52.840
It was everything that
I thought it would be

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.341
and, like...

01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:55.843
a thousand times better.

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:00.598
Then why do you have
that look on your face?

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:05.561
I finally got a job.

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:09.815
Like... a real job.

01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:11.859
Awesome, but?

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:14.528
But...

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.033
it's in LA,
and I leave next week.

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:24.288
Are you kidding?

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:25.581
It's one of the biggest

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:27.249
sports marketing companies
in the world.

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:30.336
‐How could I say no?
‐This is so like you, Harry.

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:33.506
Even getting your dream job
sounds like

01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:35.216
something just happened
to you.

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:40.638
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it. I, I...

01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:42.598
How could you...

01:16:43.974 --> 01:16:45.142
How could you...

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:49.063
let us... do that...

01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:52.858
knowing you were just
gonna leave?

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:54.819
‐Why didn't you tell me?
‐I needed to know.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:57.071
And, and I am telling you.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.197
I‐I'm telling you now!

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:00.908
This doesn't mean
we can't be together.

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:02.076
You know what? I, uh...

01:17:03.077 --> 01:17:04.537
(exhales sharply)

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:06.163
I got‐gotta go.

01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:07.081
Come on, Sam.

01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:08.958
We got the whole weekend,

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.459
an‐and LA's not that far.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:13.254
I mean, there's these
new‐fangled things
called airplanes.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:14.630
(laughs)

01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:17.466
Wha‐wha‐what?
You don't trust me
to do long‐distance?

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:19.969
How can I trust you
to do long‐distance

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:22.304
when I can't even trust you
to tell me the whole truth.

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:26.058
Before we slept together!

01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:27.309
Before I...

01:17:28.352 --> 01:17:29.979
I, I let you in.

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:34.191
You had... so many chances
to say something.

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:37.027
Do you seriously not get
what a betrayal that is?

01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:39.446
No, of course
you don't.

01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:41.907
You know, you say
that you love

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:43.826
all those things about me,

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:47.705
but if you don't understand
that trust is the only thing

01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:49.039
that matters
to me, well...

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.668
then I, I guess you
don't know me at all.

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:56.088
Or maybe you do
and that's why you did it.

01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:58.340
Because you say
you want love,

01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.717
blah blah, but...

01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:02.219
you know,
at the end of the day,

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:03.846
you're just as afraid
of it as I am.

01:18:07.558 --> 01:18:08.976
At least I know now

01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:11.020
for sure I was right.

01:18:12.897 --> 01:18:14.857
We never should have tried
to be anything more
than friends.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.525
It always screws
everything up.

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:19.195
(door opens)

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:21.614
(door closes)

01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:27.745
Bridget Jones: (on screen)

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:36.337

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.173

(beeps)

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:50.476
You ruined...

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:52.353
everything.

01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:58.484
A sandwich for Samwich.
