00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,761
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

2
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,680
EVENTS, AND OCCUPATIONS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,271
I hope we can go out safely
and watch this video together.

4
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,359
When that happens, I'll tell you properly…

5
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,154
that I like you.

6
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,594
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message after the tone.

7
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,013
Your message
will be charged after the tone.

8
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,769
(I AM) THE LIFESAVER

9
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,428
Seo-yoon.

10
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,430
Sae-bom!

11
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,982
Yi-hyun is still in the apartment.

12
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,527
I'm going to go get him.

13
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,321
How do you feel? Are you feeling better?

14
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,741
I'm here to see my mom.
They said she's here.

15
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:58,177
Seo-yoon, wait here for a moment.

16
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,862
-Seo-yoon!
-Mom!

17
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,071
Seo-yoon!

18
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,784
Yes, stay there.

19
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,999
I caught a cold.

20
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,628
You're here with the police officer lady.

21
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,298
Are you badly sick?

22
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,217
No, just a little bit.

23
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,887
But I don't want you to catch it too.

24
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,891
I heard you decided to get surgery.

25
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:45,892
Yes.

26
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,478
You shouldn't get sick
before surgery, okay?

27
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,897
Good luck with your surgery,

28
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,526
and listen to
the police officer lady, okay?

29
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,989
So our family can be healthy
and meet again.

30
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,413
Seo-yoon, you have to listen to your mom.

31
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,377
See you after the surgery.

32
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,545
Mom…

33
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,048
Bye.

34
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:32,689
I heard that Seo-yoon
can get surgery thanks to you.

35
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,818
You sent us Seo-yoon's letter too, right?

36
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,905
I was able to hold on by reading it.

37
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:45,451
If I hadn't received it,
I would've ended up like my husband.

38
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:52,792
I know I'm shameless, but please
look after Seo-yoon a little more.

39
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,295
I don't know what might happen to me, so…

40
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,090
You should go now.

41
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,134
Hurry.

42
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,806
These are typical questions,
so don't be nervous.

43
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,266
Okay.

44
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,603
How many are infected in the apartments?

45
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,066
If Detective Jung Yi-hyun
is infected too, then…

46
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,276
There are two.

47
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,447
There's Mr. Na Soo-min
from the fourth floor.

48
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,909
And there are two who died while infected?

49
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,163
Please tell us everything you know
about the infected.

50
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,666
It might help in developing the cure.

51
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,795
Good luck with your surgery.

52
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,217
I promise I'll come
visit you with Yi-hyun.

53
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,052
My mom got the disease, didn't she?

54
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,555
She's just ill, then.

55
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,182
Like me.

56
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:35,812
Of course.

57
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,733
So both you and your mom
will get better soon.

58
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,168
Seo-yoon's mother…

59
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,630
She's been enduring it until now
so she can see her daughter,

60
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,841
but she's reached her limit.

61
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,638
She'll be moved to a freezer storage
in one or two days.

62
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,036
These were made with your blood.

63
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,172
The antibodies in your body
are decreasing.

64
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,216
So?

65
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,719
These are the last
effective injections we have now.

66
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,597
These must be amplified
and used for research purposes

67
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,433
in order to develop the cure.

68
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,608
Then you just need…

69
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,903
to yield them to the world.

70
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,206
The Commander of the AFMC
is here to take you.

71
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,377
It means he's going to take
both you and the cure to the lab.

72
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,215
So…

73
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,593
Are you going to break your promise?

74
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,056
What are you doing?

75
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,266
Stop him!

76
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,687
It won't take long.

77
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,650
Do you even know what you're doing?

78
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,487
Of course, I do.

79
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,477
I'm done.

80
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,406
Where's Yoon Sae-bom?
And the remaining cure?

81
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,701
She just left. Didn't you see her?

82
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,968
If you go out the back door on
the first floor, your car will be there.

83
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,387
There are gifts in the car,
so make sure to take them.

84
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,558
But is it okay to do this?

85
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,812
I thought you were a greedy man.

86
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,024
I have plans, so don't worry
and do what you must.

87
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,236
But if you get caught in the act,
I won't take responsibility.

88
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,683
Don't worry.

89
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,144
You will get better.

90
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,571
What did you just do?

91
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,657
That was the cure, right?

92
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,826
Yes.

93
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,413
I tried to just leave, but I couldn't.

94
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,586
Are you going to shoot me?

95
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,719
What are you going to do now?

96
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,971
Even if you get out of here,

97
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,348
you used the cure already.

98
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,188
I'm not that special.

99
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:56,400
I'm sure you'll find
more people with the antibody.

100
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,779
Yi-hyun has me, but Seo-yoon…

101
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,324
doesn't have anyone.

102
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,496
I just need to be with Yi-hyun until then.

103
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,586
Hurry and get out.

104
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,713
They'll only check
those in quarantine suits.

105
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,465
They won't pay attention to you.

106
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,721
I always knew there was
something between us.

107
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,102
Wait.

108
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,438
You can't just go.

109
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,318
No.

110
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,531
If I look totally fine,
people will suspect me.

111
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,158
Are you sure?

112
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,035
It'll hurt.

113
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,999
Do it, before I change my mind.

114
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,589
Close your eyes and take a deep breath.

115
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,305
Not the face.

116
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,100
Do it where it won't hurt much.

117
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,019
People will suspect you.

118
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,938
And the swelling on the face
goes away more quickly too.

119
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,774
Okay.

120
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,611
In one blow.

121
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,602
ENTRANCE PERMIT

122
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,228
Thanks for the gifts.

123
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,419
Yoon Sae-bom escaped.

124
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,632
You know this won't end
with just your resignation, right?

125
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,885
Are you going to execute me, then?

126
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,139
I thought you were smart.

127
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,017
Why did you do that?

128
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,897
If you only stole one cure for your wife,
that could've been forgiven.

129
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,904
I did all kinds of things
to reduce the number of infected.

130
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,242
Lockdowns, quarantines, destructions…

131
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,039
I got enough blood on my hands.

132
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,086
But thanks to that, you succeeded.
You saved many people too.

133
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,006
I only saw people through the lens
of efficiency and numbers.

134
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,677
But seeing Yoon Sae-bom,

135
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,639
I learned that there are
other ways to see them.

136
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,603
Yi-hyun.

137
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,993
I didn't know how precious you were
when you were by my side.

138
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,082
I'll come and get you, wherever you are.

139
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,216
Salute…

140
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,804
Yoon Sae-bom put your uniform on
and ran away?

141
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,223
Yes. She threw me…

142
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,516
Enough!

143
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,185
Where do you think she went?

144
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,189
It looks like she's trying
to run away overseas with the cure.

145
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,692
It'd be good to put her on a wanted list
mainly around airports and piers.

146
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,738
I'm sure she went to the apartment.
Her husband is there.

147
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,989
Lieutenant Colonel.

148
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,034
Keep going.

149
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,454
Someone in the apartments
has the antibody.

150
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:54,216
Give me full authority.
Then I'll bring the cure.

151
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,386
Would this really be okay?

152
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,097
Hey, it's okay.
The news said it's fine outside too.

153
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,016
People at Unit 501 all left too,
except for that detective.

154
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,977
But if we go outside too, then…

155
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,355
It's better for us not to be here.
We'd be helping them if we go outside.

156
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,108
What?

157
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,359
Who is that?

158
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,777
Hey, wait.

159
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,112
-Who is that?
-Wait.

160
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,368
Hey, Unit 501! The wife from Unit 501!

161
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,079
Open the door! Hurry!

162
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,205
Hold on.

163
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,502
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

164
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,046
-Did they tell you to go back in?
-Please calm down.

165
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,549
What about Yi-hyun? Is he safe?

166
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,973
Is he alive?

167
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,773
ONE DAY AGO

168
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,854
Yi-hyun.

169
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,106
Get up.

170
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,068
We have to meet again.

171
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:10,912
Sae-bom.

172
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,751
Mister, are you okay?

173
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,879
You're bleeding badly.

174
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,215
I'm okay.

175
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,551
Let me get some sleep.

176
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,929
Okay.

177
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,199
Are you sure about this?

178
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,994
You said this seems right too.

179
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,081
I told you, it'll be done for
if we get it wrong ten times.

180
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,793
We have to consider
all possible variables.

181
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,593
Damn it.

182
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,763
-So-yoon?
-Who is it?

183
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,520
Help, please. Call the doctor.

184
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,022
My husband got stabbed with a knife.

185
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,150
He is conscious,
but I think he bled too much.

186
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:29,449
-Mr. Oh isn't here.
-Please. We're sorry about everything.

187
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,743
I said there is no doctor here!

188
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,204
What are you doing?

189
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,705
Yes, there's no one here…

190
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,499
-Doctor!
-Seriously…

191
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,502
Open the door!

192
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,004
But who did that to that man…

193
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,055
-Seriously…
-Open the door, please!

194
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,765
Please! Open the door!

195
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,724
Open the door!

196
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:59,062
Open the door! Do you think
you'll be safe after we all die?

197
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,190
I'm going to burn this place down!

198
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,637
Doctor.

199
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,311
Are you okay?

200
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:55,911
Hi.

201
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:01,958
Hey, did you see that?
He was shot in the arm and leg.

202
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,919
But his bleeding stopped already.

203
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,546
Then it's good. What's the problem?

204
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:11,009
The smell of his blood is disgusting,

205
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,761
and I don't want to drink it.

206
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,971
It means he's infected.

207
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,682
Then what about my blood?
Did you want to drink my blood?

208
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,685
Hey, listen to me when I say something!
Don't change the topic!

209
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,103
He is infected!

210
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,147
You can't deny it, though.

211
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,776
You even want your sister's blood.
How can you call yourself my brother?

212
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,736
What?

213
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,072
Are you okay?

214
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,408
-What are you doing? Go get water.
-Right.

215
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,623
What brings you two here?

216
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:47,420
You kept bleeding,
and I couldn't do anything all by myself.

217
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,717
I made him put it on,
just in case the disease might occur.

218
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,137
Here.

219
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,977
Don't you feel thirsty?

220
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,312
It's a lot less these days.

221
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:09,567
I do feel thirsty,
but diabetes runs in my family.

222
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,949
What about Sae-bom?

223
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:16,866
What?

224
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,661
She's not in the building.

225
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,164
The other detective
and the kid aren't here, either.

226
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,833
Those people got out, right?

227
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,169
We saw on the news
that the outside is totally fine.

228
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,464
And they said Martial Law has been lifted,
except for quarantine areas.

229
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,510
Maybe the gates are open outside as well.

230
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,637
I don't know much, either.

231
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,097
Don't move.

232
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,016
You have two holes in your body.

233
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,563
I bit Andrew.

234
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,606
What?

235
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,069
He's a murderer so if he's infected,
he'll become even more dangerous.

236
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,196
If he's alive,

237
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,742
then we must catch him.

238
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,214
Let's look for him on our way downstairs
before he kills more people.

239
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,507
Okay.

240
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,676
While the CDSCHQ
is minimizing the infections

241
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,970
with quick diagnoses
and bold local quarantines,

242
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,307
it looks like the prevention of
Mad Human Disease will be possible soon.

243
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,060
According to the authorities, the vaccine

244
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,729
currently being clinically tested
seems effective,

245
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,565
and they said they will request
the public health authorities

246
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:16,152
to give it emergency use authorization
as soon as it shows optimistic results.

247
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,280
Drink this.

248
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,491
You should eat something to get energy.

249
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:25,328
They decided to maintain quarantine
until the cure is developed.

250
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,288
Therefore, the current lockdown

251
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:31,418
on nursing homes, apartments
and so on will continue,

252
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,044
and additional local--

253
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:49,352
Look who's here. It's the brave detective.

254
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,439
By the way, did you get hurt
in the electrical room?

255
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,191
Is someone injured?

256
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,362
The moving-in cleaner couple
on the second floor.

257
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,199
The husband got stabbed by Andrew,
so I'm treating him right now.

258
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,660
I see neither Andrew
nor the building representative.

259
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,246
-Do you know where they are?
-I guess they went outside.

260
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,501
Where's your wife?

261
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,546
Andrew is dangerous right now.

262
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,673
Never open the door for him.

263
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,261
I'm going to make all three of you
get punished by the law, if possible.

264
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,473
You mean our neighbor? Unit 602?

265
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,142
Sang-hee had an affair
with the lawyer of that house, and…

266
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,644
Look at this. They did this to me.

267
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,106
Shouldn't you arrest them first?

268
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,776
We're coming from Unit 602, okay?

269
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,237
The lawyer showed us
the bite mark on his arm.

270
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,533
Right, I got the disease.

271
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,036
But there are a lot of people
who got the disease.

272
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,956
Biting someone
wouldn't be punishable, would it?

273
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,584
Mr. Oh.

274
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,713
You didn't get the disease.

275
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,675
I know because I got the disease.

276
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,806
I am holding in my desire
to bite you right now.

277
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,809
I took the drug too!

278
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,437
Taking that drug
doesn't always give you the disease.

279
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,065
Some get it late…

280
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,068
or never get it at all.

281
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,032
Where's Mr. Ko?

282
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,283
Here.

283
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,543
Doctor, his condition is worsening.
Can't you do anything?

284
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:41,047
Of course his condition is bad,
with that thing in his body.

285
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,051
Honey, I'm okay. I will recover soon.

286
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,264
So, tell that jerk
to get out of here, please.

287
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,473
Tell him to get out.

288
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,851
Hey, this is my house!

289
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,411
How long can Mr. Ko last?

290
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,831
If we pull out the knife,
he'll die right away.

291
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,750
If we leave him be,
he'll last maybe two days.

292
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,839
Let's find a way to send them outside.
Treat his wound until then.

293
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,674
I gave him painkillers and my bedroom!

294
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,593
What more can I do?

295
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:37,520
You kept Mr. Ko and Ms. Ji here
for when you feel thirsty, right?

296
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,190
What do you take me for?
How dare you say that?

297
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,861
Did you take that? And that's why
you thought you were infected?

298
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,997
Yes, I was keeping them
as my boxed lunches! So what?

299
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,583
I took it because
I felt like I could die too!

300
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,586
Just treat him well.

301
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,756
If you cause any more trouble

302
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,216
then I'll lock you up in the basement.

303
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,886
Do you think you can lock me up?

304
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:13,222
Do you think
you're King Solomon or something?

305
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,827
Honey.

306
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,539
Take this.

307
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,378
If you take this drug,
then your wound will heal quickly.

308
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,470
Did you swallow it?

309
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,269
You love me, right?

310
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,940
You won't bite me
even if you get the disease, right?

311
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,703
Hey.

312
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,371
Sir, are you okay?

313
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,625
I'm not okay.

314
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,255
You don't look okay either, young man.

315
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,841
How's your wife?

316
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,218
We're okay, so…

317
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,931
Just look after our son, please.

318
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,601
He's still not back?

319
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:46,274
What? Isn't he on the second floor?

320
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,611
He said he wanted to go outside, but…

321
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,286
If you see him,

322
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,622
tell him to come back home. We're fine.

323
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:07,128
Home is a place where you can go back to
when you're having a hard time.

324
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,839
Okay.

325
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,632
If you see Andrew…

326
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,597
If you see an unfamiliar man,
don't open the door for him.

327
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,348
He's very dangerous.

328
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,602
Okay.

329
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,899
Why would he come here, though?
It's just two old people here.

330
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,943
Sir, do you have enough food?

331
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,737
Would you like us to give you some?

332
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,744
Don't give them food.
We barely have enough for us.

333
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,164
I'm going to share mine.

334
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,999
How can you be so mean?

335
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,771
You two, stand back.

336
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,398
He's infected.

337
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,444
I saw him biting Andrew.

338
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,571
But I'm infected too.

339
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,491
Building representative,
this is no time to fight.

340
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,245
There's a high chance
of Andrew still being in the building.

341
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,708
Andrew is dead.

342
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,535
I was going to go outside
and meet the person in charge.

343
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,662
But the infected are at the entrance too.

344
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:09,417
Still, we caught the killer,
so we just need to wait quietly.

345
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,254
So, did you get rid of Andrew's dead body?

346
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,632
It's on the rooftop.

347
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,344
You bit him to death, Mr. Jung!

348
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,347
There's no one on the rooftop.

349
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,686
It looks like you're trying to trick me.

350
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,230
Do you think I'm stupid?

351
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,607
I'm not!

352
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,279
I'm normal.
I'm not like you infected people!

353
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,410
It's dangerous to go alone,
building representative.

354
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:53,336
Is it okay to just let her be like that?

355
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,547
She lost her family.

356
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,594
I'm sure she needs someone
to blame and hate.

357
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,514
Oh, gosh.

358
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,888
I'm sure he hid Andrew's body
and lied to me.

359
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,683
I can kill him too if something happens.

360
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,024
It looks like Andrew
and Kim Dong-hyun both went outside.

361
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,033
What?

362
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,746
Hey.

363
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,095
What are you doing?
What if the infected crowd in?

364
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,346
Don't come out.

365
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,389
Okay.

366
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,521
But…

367
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,503
Are you okay?

368
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,721
How long has it been since you got bitten?

369
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,689
Hey, isn't that
the jobless guy on the third floor?

370
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,609
It looks like he's hurt.

371
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,527
Hurt? He got bitten!

372
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,415
Didn't he…

373
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,170
get the disease?

374
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,631
It hasn't occurred yet.

375
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,677
I'm sure he can endure a bit more
if he's with his family.

376
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,082
Dad, I'm sorry.

377
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,839
My goodness.

378
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,971
Honey.

379
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,684
Dong-hyun is home.

380
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,622
Moon-hee.

381
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,250
What?

382
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,213
Are you okay? Are you coming to?

383
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:07,840
It hurts less.

384
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,759
Who gave you that drug from earlier?

385
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,224
How about we pull this out, Moon-hee?

386
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:22,730
Okay.

387
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,399
Wait.

388
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,154
Do you have more of that drug?

389
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,745
Give me water.

390
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,795
Let's pull it out.

391
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,049
I'm going to pull it out.

392
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,468
Moon-hee, you know…

393
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,347
I can't just leave this place
when I'm such a mess.

394
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,684
Let's take this house.

395
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,814
How?

396
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,665
Doctor.

397
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,626
Why? Did your husband die?

398
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,547
I pulled the knife out.

399
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,423
Seriously?

400
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,635
I told you not to pull it out!
Did he bleed a lot on the floor?

401
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,720
Why didn't you listen to me!

402
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,725
Doctor…

403
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,229
you don't have any family, do you?

404
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,910
Doesn't this look a lot
more swollen than before?

405
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,831
How many times
do I have to tell you it doesn't!

406
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,917
Are you sure?

407
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,628
I am.

408
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,298
Stop touching it!
That's what's making it more swollen!

409
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,720
Are you sure this is okay?

410
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,640
What should we do with the cryptocurrency?

411
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,018
We have the passcode,
but we don't have the laptop.

412
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,480
The laptop!

413
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,280
Sang-hee! I'll give you money,
so open the door.

414
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,240
Open the door, Sang-hee!

415
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,659
Isn't he trying to bite us again?

416
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,870
I'll give you money.

417
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,792
-How much will you give me?
-Hey!

418
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,961
That cleaner asshole has gone totally mad!

419
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,212
He's insane!

420
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,882
Stop!

421
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,018
If Mr. Ko is in a critical condition
then we must send him out.

422
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,063
-We can't just let him die like that.
-Detective Jung!

423
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,237
Detective Jung, help me.
I almost got killed.

424
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,699
What now?

425
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,579
He gave us the drug.
He said my husband would get better.

426
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,373
Are you nuts, old woman?

427
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,793
It's not true!
Why would I make more monsters?

428
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,254
Is Mr. Ko okay?

429
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,132
He's still in pain.
He's lying down right now.

430
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,220
Can you please chase him away?

431
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:44,098
I'm terrified to be with him.

432
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,184
They're the ones who should be kicked out!

433
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,938
Don't you trust me?
We're residents of the same apartment.

434
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,774
This is the first time hearing you say

435
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,901
we're residents of the same apartment.

436
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,945
I warned you, didn't I?

437
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,073
-You're going to the gym.
-The laptop!

438
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,991
Tell them to give me my laptop!

439
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,911
My laptop!

440
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,791
-Get the elevator.
-Right.

441
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,465
Are you happy that I'm leaving?

442
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,844
What the…

443
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,480
What are you doing?

444
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,774
Where are you taking Dr. Oh?

445
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,152
He's going to be in quarantine.

446
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,780
If you don't want to end up like him,
you should be careful.

447
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,632
Honey. This is all ours, right?

448
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,967
Of course.

449
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,303
That jerk doesn't have any family.

450
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:07,097
I almost got killed by that asshole.

451
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,185
We just need to demand this house
for compensation.

452
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,396
But he'll never give it up.

453
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,274
We'll get rid of him
before the lockdown is over.

454
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,818
They'll think that the infected did it.

455
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,528
Right?

456
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,575
Moon-hee…

457
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,369
Give me some water.

458
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:30,871
Okay.

459
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,179
Just take this too.

460
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,893
I'm really thirsty for some reason.

461
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,908
How much is all of this?

462
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:15,207
One, two, three…

463
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,432
Why didn't you go outside with your wife?

464
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,274
I had to watch the house
until Sae-bom got back.

465
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:44,236
We got this as
a special provision for public officials,

466
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,779
and it was hard to get it.

467
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,871
We know what you did for us.

468
00:47:56,164 --> 00:48:01,044
If it wasn't for you,
something terrible would've happened.

469
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,172
Thank you.

470
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,265
I should look for Andrew once more
after getting some rest.

471
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,893
It can be dangerous,
so you two should go home now.

472
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,479
We can help too.

473
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,232
I can be dangerous too.

474
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,445
Mr. Na seems much better now…

475
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,990
but I'm not.

476
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,790
Be careful.

477
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,139
Sae-bom.

478
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:41,895
How are you doing?

479
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:56,743
I miss you.

480
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,773
We were saved thanks to Mr. Jung.

481
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,317
He's infected, but…

482
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,403
So he's home now?

483
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,115
It's dangerous.
Don't go outside. Stay home.

484
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,410
-The lockdown will be over soon.
-What? Really?

485
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,620
See? I told you not to go outside!

486
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,538
Great.

487
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,373
That's awesome.

488
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:04,436
Hey! Sang-hee. I knew you'd come.

489
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:09,149
Let me go! Let me go and talk!

490
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,402
What are you trying to do without the key?

491
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,614
Building representative, please help me!

492
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,949
I only came here to help…

493
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,160
Are you mad, old woman?

494
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,960
Isn't it better to get rid
of that detective jerk on our own?

495
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:32,339
The woman ran away,
so we just need to get rid of him.

496
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:38,345
So are you saying
we should kill the detective?

497
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,305
He's infected.

498
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:47,229
This can break that thing, so do as I say.

499
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,205
Help!

500
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,262
Mr. Oh…

501
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,681
Calm down

502
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,308
and let Ms. Woo go.

503
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:29,396
Mr. Jung, just kill everyone uninfected

504
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,984
and say it was all because of the disease.

505
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:34,901
Yes.

506
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,738
The monsters did all of this.

507
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,992
You people are the monsters,
not those with the disease.

508
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,288
Aren't you thirsty?

509
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,177
Let's see who the real monster is.

510
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,100
Go.

511
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,700
Jung Yi-hyun!

512
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,119
Doesn't the blood smell good?

513
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:29,122
Don't hold it in! You must've been
holding it in all this time!

514
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,625
Jung Yi-hyun!

515
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,294
Come out!

516
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,171
Hey, come out!

517
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,304
Why aren't you listening to me?

518
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,599
These apartments are mine! Listen to me!

519
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,898
Calm down.

520
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,691
I'm not here to catch you.

521
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,531
You killed my husband.

522
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,910
I caught the murderer,
and I'm not infected either.

523
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,495
I deserve to be the representative.

524
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,871
Okay.

525
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,582
I'll vote for you
when you get released from prison.

526
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,544
-Thank you.
-Come out!

527
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,588
-Thank you.
-Hey, come out!

528
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,382
Come out!

529
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,676
Just come out! Bite me! Change!

530
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,552
My disease will occur soon too!

531
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,889
You're so dead!

532
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,038
Yi-hyun.

533
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,046
I'm here.

534
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,149
I realized it after I heard what you said.

535
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,152
What's really important is…

536
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,197
who I'm going to be with in my house.

537
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:33,246
So I'm going to stay with you.

538
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,711
Stay with me.

539
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:23,838
I'm fine with whatever state you're in.

540
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,790
Are you sure that someone
in the apartment has the antibody?

541
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,667
Someone testified.

542
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:46,254
Please tell us everything you know
about the infected.

543
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,882
It might help in developing the cure.

544
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,634
I don't know much, but…

545
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,137
Ms. Na said

546
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,348
her brother's wound didn't change.

547
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:00,059
She said it neither gets worse nor heals.

548
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,645
You relied on that
and asked for full authority?

549
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,439
Ji-soo.

550
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,943
We never had anything
to rely on from the start.

551
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,342
Hae-seong, please open the door.

552
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,718
I got the cryptocurrency!

553
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,971
It's been hard for you, right?

554
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,057
Sorry for being so sensitive.

555
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,600
SO-YOON, ARE YOU SAFE?
I MISS YOU SO MUCH

556
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,603
Come on, we did this
so we can all be happy.

557
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,900
Hae-seong, are you listening? Hae-seong!

558
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,860
SHIN SO-YOON

559
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,363
Hae-seong!

560
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:56,032
Darling, we can be happy now!

561
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,951
-Open the door.
-So-yoon?

562
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,205
I'm really sorry. It's all my fault, okay?

563
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,707
-Hae-seong!
-Don't ever contact me again.

564
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,752
-No, I…
-Hae-seong, you're in there, right?

565
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:11,297
I really regret what I did. I mean it.

566
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,174
-Okay?
-Can you hear me?

567
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:17,428
-Come here and open the door!
-But I really am repenting…

568
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,305
We can be happy!

569
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,515
Hae-seong!

570
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,726
-The call cannot be connected…
-Darling!

571
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:33,027
Hae-seong, what we had was good.

572
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,905
It'll be even better now, okay?

573
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,618
Open the door, will you?

574
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,789
Right, I can have her instead.

575
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:48,751
Damn it.

576
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,211
Were you bitten on your arm?

577
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,260
Is the Internet working now?

578
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,763
Hae-seong! I'll share this with you.

579
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,642
-The passcode.
-Okay.

580
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,528
LOG IN

581
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,366
WELCOME TO OPBIT

582
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:29,250
Over here.

583
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:40,345
TOTAL ASSET
TOTAL PROFIT

584
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:44,140
The future still looks gloomy
for various economic indexes.

585
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:46,017
The stock markets all around the world

586
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,769
are dropping every day.

587
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:51,773
The number of stocks at its lowest price
exceeded 30 today.

588
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,775
The prices of oil, gold,

589
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:55,526
-Honey…
-and raw materials plummeted.

590
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,320
The national oil price is now…

591
01:00:57,403 --> 01:01:00,740
The cure will be out someday, right?

592
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,659
It'll be out in no time.

593
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,913
Suddenly, the people
from the Community Health Center

594
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,374
could come to our house
and ring our doorbell.

595
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:15,588
The cryptocurrency market value today…

596
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,133
What…

597
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,677
What?

598
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,350
Mom, they're here! We're saved!

599
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:33,523
I told you they'd come, didn't I?

600
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,816
Careful.

601
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,150
We're saved!

602
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,277
Honey!

603
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,281
Thank you.

604
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:53,418
No, I didn't bite anybody.
I'm telling the truth.

605
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,920
I don't feel thirsty, either.

606
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:59,048
Give me water, then. I mean it.
I really don't feel thirsty.

607
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,259
I swear I didn't bite anybody.

608
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,760
He really was totally fine.

609
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,596
Maybe he's all better.
No, I'm sure he's all better.

610
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,681
Right, Soo-min?

611
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,975
I am. Because I'm not thirsty.

612
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,735
Nothing's wrong, right?

613
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,573
-I don't feel thirsty.
-Don't talk too much!

614
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:24,991
I'm telling the truth.

615
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,748
We found the holder of the antibody.
We're taking him now.

616
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,546
And I will take care of Yoon Sae-bom.

617
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,757
It's up to you.
Just bring the holder of the antibody.

618
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:45,803
Take him safely.

619
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,723
Find Yoon Sae-bom and Jung Yi-hyun

620
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,934
and take them to the dorm.

621
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:54,061
Yes, sir.

622
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,481
No!

623
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,398
This is our house!

624
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:58,816
What are you doing? No!

625
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,026
I said, stop!

626
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,904
Honey, what are they doing?

627
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,864
-No! This is our house!
-No!

628
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,282
No!

629
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,748
-This is our house!
-This is mine!

630
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,625
-No! I'm taking these!
-No! Let go!

631
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,502
-No! These are mine!
-This is our house!

632
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,128
-Let go!
-This is mine!

633
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,630
-No! This is our house!
-No!

634
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,131
I can't leave them here!

635
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,091
-I won't go!
-Let go!

636
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,968
-I'm taking them!
-This is our house!

637
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,304
-Those are mine!
-Honey! This is our house!

638
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:32,683
Stay here.

639
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,977
It's hot but you can't help it.

640
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:38,981
Don't you dare think that this is the end.

641
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,735
Sae-bom, you will vote for me, right?

642
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:45,530
I will.

643
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:46,656
Let's go.

644
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,090
We shouldn't leave…

645
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,218
Kim Se-hoon like that, right?

646
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,429
Let's put him in his house.

647
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,723
I'll open the door.

648
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,882
Call Yoon Sae-bom.

649
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,618
Drop your gun, Ms. Yoon.

650
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:15,578
Just shoot him.

651
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,913
It's okay if I get shot.

652
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,918
Drop your gun if you want
to save Jung Yi-hyun!

653
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,795
I'm fine, so just shoot!

654
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,786
Here, fresh blood.

655
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:42,998
Yi-hyun!

656
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:45,918
Yi-hyun!

657
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:57,680
I told you I'll be the bad cop.

658
01:06:59,014 --> 01:06:59,974
So you…

659
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,477
keep being the good cop.

660
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,149
Hey.

661
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,491
Hey!

662
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,203
Yi-hyun!

663
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,329
No!

664
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:24,749
Yi-hyun!

665
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,168
Jung Yi-hyun!

666
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:52,860
CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

667
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,802
DEFENDANT

668
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,119
Mr. Lee Seung-young.

669
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,367
Careful.

670
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,953
Are you okay after all that running?

671
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,496
I'm totally fine.

672
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,622
Really?

673
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:31,208
Should we start some real workouts, then?

674
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:32,459
How about the gym?

675
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,128
All residents can work out there.

676
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:42,052
I have plans, so I have to go home now.

677
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,095
What?

678
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,138
Goodbye.

679
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:45,556
What plans?

680
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,141
Seo-yoon.

681
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,185
Now then, let's go.

682
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,446
What are you thinking about?

683
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:04,116
Last year, when we got locked up in here.

684
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,411
It was tough, wasn't it?

685
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:08,954
Still…

686
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:12,374
it was all right because I had you.

687
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:19,256
Since when did you start liking me?

688
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,760
From the very start, I told you.

689
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,386
Why won't you believe me?

690
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,305
I knew you were my destiny,

691
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:28,224
and we'd be together until the end.

692
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:31,226
So you never gave up?

693
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,437
Why do you think I became a cop?

694
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,315
Hey, did you become a cop because of me?

695
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,778
I thought about going to the US,
but what you said kept coming to mind.

696
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:44,365
You said there's no limit to our futures,
so I should just do it.

697
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,868
-But then you joined the SOU.
-Hey! I didn't know.

698
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,707
So are you happy?

699
01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:58,170
Of course, I am.

700
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:00,214
When I'm with you.

701
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:05,135
-I'm not that happy without you.
-You liar.

702
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:10,099
The winner is exempt
from taking out the trash for one week!

703
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,934
You cheated! Hey!

704
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:13,769
And food waste too!

705
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,479
I won't lose!

706
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:34,933
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING HAPPINESS

707
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:41,815
