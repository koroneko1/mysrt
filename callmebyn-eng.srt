-Thank you so much
for having me.
-Oh, my goodness.

You're bigger
than your picture.

Well, I couldn't get
all of me in the photo.

gonna pass.

Will you make
an excuse for me
to your mom, though?

Thanks, man.

-Back from the dead.

67
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,953

-It seemed like it, huh?

-How are you?
-I... Well, rested now.

-Thank you.
-I'm glad.

70
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,250
Would you like
some espresso?

71
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,585
[Oliver] I would love some.
Thank you very much.

72
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,172
This looks amazing.
I didn't take your
seat, did I?

73
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,799
Oh, no, no, no.
It's okay. Please.

74
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,676
Did you...
Did you recover
from your trip?

75
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,052
I did. Yeah, big time.

-Thank you.
-Good.

77
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,639
I could show you around.

That'd be great.
Thank you.

Is there a...
Is there a bank in town?

80
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,561
I'd love to start
an account while I'm here.

81
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,273
[in Italian] Let me do it.

82
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,400

Sorry.

-Yeah, well... [laughs]

has ever had a local

-Mmm.

Have another egg.

98
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,478
Oh, stupid.

99
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,688
No, no, no.
I know myself too well.

100
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,524
If I have a second,
I'm just gonna have a third,
and then a fourth,

101
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,900
and then you're just
gonna have to roll
me out of here.

102
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,405
-Delicious.
-[Annella] Darling?

103

[Oliver] Thank you.

104
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,908
Shall I give him
Anchise's bike?

[Oliver] So, what does
one do around here?

108
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,117
Wait for the summer to end.

109
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,410
Yeah?

110
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,078
What do you do
in the winter?

111
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,997
-Wait for summer to come?
-Well, we only come
here for Christmas

112
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,665
and some other vacations.

113
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,126
-Christmas?
I thought you...
-And Easter as well.

114
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,668
-Thought you were Jewish.
-Well, we are Jewish,

115
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,004
but also American,
Italian, French.

116
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,299
Somewhat atypical
combination.

117
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,343
Besides my family,
you're probably

118
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,304
the only other Jew
to set foot in this town.

119
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,931
I'm from a small town
in New England.

120
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,558
I know what it's like
to be the odd Jew out.

121
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,435
[Elio chuckles]

122
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,437
So, what do you
do around here?

123
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,815
-Just read books.
-[bells chiming]

-Yeah?
-Go out at night.

126
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,947
-I don't know.
-That sounds fun.

127
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,786
All right, buddy,
thanks for the help.

128
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,589
[Elio] Sorry.
Sorry about that.

129
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,132
It's all right.

130
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,550
All right, later.

131
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,770
[Perlman]
What do you have there?

132
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,814
That should all be...

133
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,232
[laughing]

134
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,986
Oh, what is this?

135
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:39,782
These are the
continuation of these
archaeology department...

136
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,660
[Perlman]
These are archaeology?

137
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,743
[Oliver] Yeah, those are
archaeology. The rest of these
should be history.

138
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,911
[Perlman] Ah, okay.

139
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,165
-More apricot juice?
-[Oliver] Yeah.

140
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,875
-Here, tesoro.
-Thank you.

141
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,335
[in French]
Help yourself, darling.

142
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,670
Thanks.

143
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,963
[piano music playing]

144
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,305
[speaking English]
Help yourself
to some more.

145
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,893
The word "apricot"
comes from the Arabic.

146
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,313
It's like the words
"algebra," "alchemy,"
"alcohol."

147
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,856
It derives from
an Arabic noun

148
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,816
combined with the
Arabic article "al"
before it.

149
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,820
The origin of our
Italian albicocca

150
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,531
is al-barquq.

151
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,325
It's amazing that
today in Israel and
many Arab countries,

152
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:26,538
the fruit's referred to
by a totally different
name, Mismish.

153
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,956
I may have to disagree
with you there, Professor.

154
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,625
Ah?

155
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,545
I'm gonna talk etymology,
so just bear with me
a second. Um...

156
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,171
You're right in the case
that most Latin words

157
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,507
do find their origins
in Greek words.

158
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,799
However, in the case
of "apricot,"

159
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,719
it's a little bit more
of a complicated journey.

160
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,679
Ah. How so?

161
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,348
Well, here, the Greek
actually takes over
from the Latin.

162
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,518
Latin word being,
praecoquum or precoquere.

163
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,353
So it's, "Precook" or,
"Pre-ripen,"as you know.

164
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,605
To be precocious or premature.

165
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,023
And the Byzantines,
to go on,

166
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,943
then borrowed praecox,
which became

167
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,862
prekokkia, which then
became berikokki,

168
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,156
which is how
the Arabs got al-barquq.

169
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,753
That's courtesy
of Philology 101.

170
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,464
Flying colors.

171
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,636
He does this every year.

172
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,195
It's about drink time.
Let's go here.

173
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,407
-[in Italian] Ciao, Romano.
-Ciao, Oliver.

174
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,034
-How are you?
-All good.

175
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,248
[in Italian]

176
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,874
Ciao, boys!

177
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,794
All good?

178
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,545
All good!

179
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,130
[speaking English] Let's see.
What have we got?

180
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,008
-Can you start please?
-Of course!

181
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,885
[indistinct chatter]

182
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,988
[Elio] Good morning, gentlemen.

183
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,740
[all greeting]

184
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,537
How do you know
about this place?

185
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,374
Okay.

186
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,000
[in French] Go, Chiara!

187
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,047
[speaking English]
No, no, no, no, no!

188
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,716
[whooping and clapping]

189
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,387
[in Italian]
He's better than the guy
who came last year.

190
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,263
Remember?

191
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,765
Get in there!

192
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,685
Much better!
See how cute he is.

193
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,731
[indistinct chatter]

194
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,905
Elio, water!

195
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,450
[speaking English]
Perfect timing.

196
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,498
-[Oliver] What's the matter?
Are you all right?
-Huh?

197
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,751
-What, pinch a nerve?
-I'm okay.

198
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,711
Here. Hold this.

199
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,796
Trust me.
I'm about to be a doctor.

200
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,631
Hey, hey, come here.
See? That's the problem.

201
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,132
You're too stressed.

202
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,510
-You just gotta
relax a little bit.
-I am relaxing.

203
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,220
Marzia,
come here for a minute.

204
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,181
Back me up here.

205
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,725
-Feel that. Right there?
-[man] Oliver.

206
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:34,809
-It's too tight, right?
-Yeah.

207
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,227
-He needs to relax.
-[man] Oliver!

208
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,353
Later.

209
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,937
You should relax more.

210
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,609
Okay, guys, ready?

211
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,155
[whooping]

212
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,951
[Oliver] Okay, our ball,
our ball, our ball.

213
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,411
Twelve serving 11.

214
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,080
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

215
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,291
Go, go, go. Yeah, good.
It's yours, it's yours.

216
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,627
[in Italian]

217
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,255
Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella
and the others are coming
over for dinner.

218
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,883
Is Oliver staying with us
or going out?

219
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,426
Don't know.

220
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,762
What a movie star!

221
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,598
Yes, those Americans...

222
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,832
Sparkling wine!

223
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,041
He's late.

224
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,754
Don't you think...

225
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,882
Don't you think
he's impolite when
he says, "Later"?

226
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,718
Arrogant.

227
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,095
[in English]
I don't think
he's arrogant.

228
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,722
Just watch.

229
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,766
This is how he'll say
good-bye to us when
the time comes.

230
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,059
With his... "Later."

231
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,687
[all laughing]

232
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,105
Meanwhile, we'll have
to put up with him
for six long weeks.

233
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,232
Won't we, darling?

234
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,902
I think he's shy.

235
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,320
You'll grow to like him.

236
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,613
What if I grow to hate him?

237
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,781
[Annella speaking Italian]
Oh, no, sweetheart.

238
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,577
-Take his plates away.
-Very well, madam.

239
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,624
[Annella] Darling?

240
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,548
[indistinct conversation
in Italian]

241
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,813
[speaking English]
Elio, play something.

242
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,565
[in Italian] I don't want to

243
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,400
Why not?

244
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,193
Because I don't want to.

245
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,612
Why don't you go
to Moscazzano with others?

246
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,823
Because I don't want to.

247
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,575
[Annella speaking English]
You're spoiling
everyone's fun.

248
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,580
[low cheering]

249
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,710
Play well, darling.

250
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,798
[sighing]

251
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,599

[knocking on door]

256
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,763
-Hey.
-Hey.

257
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,140
What are you doing?

258
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,390
Reading.

259
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,602
How come you're not
with everyone else
down by the river?

260
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,024
-I have an allergy. It's...
-Yeah, me too.

261
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,484
Maybe we have the same one.

262
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,610
Hmm?

263
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,447
Why don't you and I
go swimming?

264
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,407
-Right now?
-Yeah.

265
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,242
Come on. Let's go.

266
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,954
Do we have
to go right now?

267
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,874
-I'll go get changed.
-Okay.

268
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,416
-Meet you downstairs.
-Mmm-hmm.

269
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,687
See you downstairs.

270
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:33,191
[door opens and shuts]

271
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,348
Elio, what are you doing?

272
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,684
Reading my music.

273
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,145
No, you're not.

274
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,480
-Thinking, then.
-Yeah?

275
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,860
About what?

276
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,448
It's private.

277
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,783
You're not gonna tell me?

278
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,492
I'm not gonna tell you.

279
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,536
He's not gonna tell me
what he's thinking about.

280
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:28,621
[Annella] Elio.

281
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,497
I guess I'll go hang out
with your mom.

282
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,667
[Oliver] More apricot
juice, please.

283
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,796
[Annella] That's a good boy.

284
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,380
Thank God you're helping me.

285
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,518
[laughter in distance]

288
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,072
-[Oliver] Sounds nice.
-[stops playing]

289
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,782
[Elio] Thought you
didn't like it.

290
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,165
Play it again, will you?

291
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,259
Follow me.

292
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,852
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

[plays same tune faster]

294
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,751
That sounds different.
Did you change it?

295
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,629
-Well, I changed it
a little bit.
-Why?

296
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,380
I just played it the way
Liszt would have played it

297
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,176
if he'd altered
Bach's version.

298
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,886
Play that again.

299
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,138
-Play what again?
-The thing
you played outside.

300
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,431
Oh, you want me to play
the thing I played outside?

301
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,643
-Please.
-Ah. [mutters] Of course.

302
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,189
[plays with slight variation]

303
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,793
I can't believe
you changed it again.

304
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,420
-Oh, I changed it a little bit.
-Yeah. Why?

305
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,006
I just played it the way
Busoni would've played it

306
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,259
if he'd altered
Liszt's version.

307
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,468
And what is wrong
with Bach the way
Bach would've played...

308
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,845
Bach never wrote it
for the guitar.

309
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,471
In fact, we're not
even sure Bach
wrote it at all.

310
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,266
Forget I asked.

[plays first tune]

312
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,631
It's young Bach.

313
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,549
He dedicated it
to his brother.

314

[music plays gently
on headphones]

316
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,876
Hey, Professor.

317
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,086
Hello.

318
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,297
Here, please.

319
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,923
I need help.

320
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,051
[Oliver] Just be honest.

321
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,761

483
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,206
Goodness.

484
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,337
-Are you going, too?
-No, no.

485
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,506
I should stay and do
some work on my book.

486
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,885
Come on. How about a drink
to celebrate the day?

487
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,012
-Okay, maybe just one.
-All right!

The Cosmic Fragments
by Heraclitus.

493
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:34,271
[Oliver] The meaning
of the river flowing is not
that all things are changing

494
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,355
so that we cannot
encounter them twice,

495
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,525
but that some things stay
the same only by changing.

00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,202
[speaking other language]
Sorry, Elio. I brought
some clean clothes.

00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,286
Mmm.

501
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,708
Leave the door open.

Darling, have you

Mafalda.

509
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,766
It's in German.

510
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:44,437
Okay.

511
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:50,568
I can't remember where
we left off, but I think
you'll like this one.

512
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,740
Come here, darling.

513
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,494
So, I'll translate, huh?

with a princess.

And she, too,
is in love with him,

though she seems not to be
entirely aware of it.

the young knight

"Is it better
to speak or to die?"

530
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,733
I'd never have the courage
to ask a question like that.

531
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,570
I doubt that.

532
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,701
Hey, Elly-Belly.

00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,664
You do know that
you can always talk to us.

[birds chirping]

535
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:36,508
[Elio] My mom's been
reading this 16th-century
French romance.

536
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,636
She read some of it
to my dad and I the day
the lights went out.

537
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,305
[Oliver] Yeah, about
the knight that doesn't know
whether to speak or die?

538
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,431
[Elio] Right.

539
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,100
[Oliver] So,
does he or doesn't he?

540
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,895
"Better to speak,"
she said.

541
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,608
But she's on her guard.

542
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,902
She senses a trap somewhere.

543
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,161
So, does he speak?

544
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,497
No.

545
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,876
-He fudges.
-Hmm.

546
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,212
It figures.

547
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,380
He's French.

548
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:24,055
I gotta go to town
in a little bit to pick
some things up.

549
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:27,058
Oh, I can go. I'm not
doing anything today.

550
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,269
Then why don't
we go together?

551
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,604
Right now?

552
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,899
Yeah. Right now.

553
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,360
That is, of course,
unless you have more
important business going on.

[mock imitation]

Mind if I put
this in your bag?

Yes, please.

I straightened the wheels
and inflated the tires.

00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,765
Perfect. Thanks.

560
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,645

00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:15,565
I was coming home
the other day, and I scraped
myself pretty badly.

on applying some sort
of witches' brew.

-Want one?
-Sure.

568
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:32,725

Not bad at all.

I thought
you didn't smoke.

571

I don't.

572
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:51,076
-So, World War II, huh?
-No. This is World War I.

573
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,579
You'd have to be
at least 80 years old
to have known any of them.

574
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,873
I never even heard
of the Battle of Piave.

575
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,544
Battle of Piave was one
of the most lethal battles
of World War I.

170,000 people died.

I know nothing, Oliver.

Well, you seem to know
more than anybody else
around here.

580
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:20,022
Well, if you only knew
how little I know about
the things that matter.

581
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,652
What things that matter?

582
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,327
You know what things.

583
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,627
Why are you
telling me this?

584

'Cause I thought
you should know.

Because you thought
I should know?

'Cause I wanted
you to know?

'Cause I wanted
you to know.

Because there's no one else
I can say this to but you.

Are you saying
what I think
you're saying?

Don't go anywhere.
Stay right here.

You know I'm not
going anywhere.

They mixed up
all of my pages.

I'm gonna have to
retype this whole thing.

I'm not gonna have
anything to work on
this afternoon.

I shouldn't have
said anything.

600

Just pretend
you never did.

601
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,239
What does that mean?
We're on speaking
terms, but not really?

602
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,036
It means, we can't
talk about those
kinds of things

603
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,414
Okay?

604
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,042
We just can't.

-Let's go.

Good morning, ma'am.

Excuse me.

615
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:26,268
Could I ask
for a glass of water?

"People of Italy"

00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,701
That's Italy.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

621
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:27,913
[speaking English] Come on.

622
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:52,646
This is my spot.
It's all mine.

623
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:57,193
I come here to read.

624
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,444
I can't tell you
the number of books
I've read here.

625
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,116
Oh, my God.
It's freezing.

626
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,161
The spring
is in the mountains.

627
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,163
The Alpi Orobie.

628
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,874
The water comes
straight down from there.

629
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,236
[Oliver] I like
the way you say things.

630
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,780
I don't know why
you're always putting
yourself down, though.

631
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,157
[Elio] So you won't,
I guess?

632
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:50,913
You really that afraid
of what I think?

633
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:04,176
[both chuckle]

634
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,011
[Oliver] You're making things

964
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:02,131
[Elio] Do I know you?

gonna make it.

971
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:12,827
I'm glad you came.

972
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:25,339
Yeah, I'm nervous.

973
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:06,338
[whispering]
I like what you've done
with the place.

974
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:09,466
It's nice.

[chuckles]

976
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:38,120
You okay?

977
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:44,794
Me okay.

978
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:00,183
[laughing]

979
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,280
-Can I kiss you?
-Yes, please.

01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,758
[Oliver] What are you doing?

983
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:16,844
[Elio] Nothing.

984
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,482
Does this make you happy?

985
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,194
You're not gonna get
a nosebleed on me, are you?

986
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:35,863
I'm not gonna get...

987
01:25:05,768 --> 01:25:07,811
Off, off, off, off, off.

988
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,608
Yeah. Just pull it.

989
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:16,194
Or I'll pull it.

990

992

[Elio] Oliver.

993
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:32,688
Call me by your name,
and I'll call you by mine.

Elio.

-Oliver.
-Elio.

998
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:04,678
Did we make noise?

999
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,220
Nothing to worry about.

1000
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:09,224
I don't know.
Mafalda always looks
for signs.

1001
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:10,851
Well, she's not
gonna find any.

1002
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:20,903
[Elio] You wore that shirt
the first day you were here.

1003
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:23,906
Will you give it to me
when you go?

1004
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:29,452
[birds chirping]

1005
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:36,478
Let's go swimming.

1006
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:32,117
Are you gonna hold
what happened last night
against me?

1007
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:33,576
No.

1008
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:45,315
Elio. Come here.

1009
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:52,364
Take your trunks off.

1010
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:09,631
[Oliver]
Well, that's promising.

1011
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:10,924
You're hard again.

1012
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,008
Good.

1013
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:19,891
[chuckles]

1014
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,721
Professor, I got your note.
Thank you for reminding me.

1015
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:00,598
I'm gonna go into town
and pick up
those typed pages today,

1016
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,476
so maybe this afternoon
would be a good time to...

1017
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:04,894
Later.

1018
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:07,439
[all laughing]

1019
01:32:07,481 --> 01:32:09,274
We'll look them over later,
before you leave.

1020
01:32:09,316 --> 01:32:12,486
Okay. So, later.

1021
01:32:12,568 --> 01:32:13,569
Later.

1022
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:26,791
Oliver.

1023
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:39,721
[Oliver] You're not
sick of me yet?

1024
01:32:39,762 --> 01:32:41,973
No, I just...
I just wanted
to be with you.

1025
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,146
I'll... I'm gonna...
I'll go.

1026
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,649
Do you know how happy I am
that we slept together?

1027
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,153
I don't know.

1028
01:32:56,779 --> 01:32:58,198
Of course, you don't know.

1029
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:02,952
I don't want you
to regret anything.

1030
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:05,914
And I hate the thought
that maybe I may have
messed you up or...

1031
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:08,333
I don't want either of us
to pay for this,

1032
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:09,625
-one way or another.
-No, I...

1033
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:12,712
It's not like
I'm gonna tell anyone.

1034
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:15,090
You're not gonna be, like,
getting in trouble.

1035
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:16,674
That's not what
I'm talking about.

1036
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:29,979
Are you happy I came here?

1037
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,612
I would kiss you if I could.

1038

[Mafalda speaking Italian]
Times change.

1039

[Pasquina] Thank God
we had the partisans.

1040
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:58,174
[Mafalda] I know, but times
have changed. It's different.

1041
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:00,343
[Pasquina] What do you
think of Bettino?

1042
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:03,472
[Mafalda] I don't like him.
[Pasquina] I like him.

1043
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:05,807
[Mafalda] I'm happy, actually.

1044
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:10,853
I don't know. We'll see.

1045
01:34:13,315 --> 01:34:15,858
[Pasquina] Anyway,
they make the rules.

1046

You've moved on
to the plant kingdom already.

What's next? Minerals?

I suppose you've already
given up animals.

You know that's me.

I'm sick, aren't I?

I wish everybody
was as sick as you.

something sick?
-Please don't do that.

[Elio] God,
we wasted so many days.

1082
01:40:27,814 --> 01:40:29,064
Why didn't
you give me a sign?

-I did. I did.
-You didn't give me
a sign.

When?

1085
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:35,154
You remember
when we were
playing volleyball

1086
01:40:35,196 --> 01:40:36,698
and I touched you?

1087

Just to show you
that I liked you?

1088
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:45,665
And the way you reacted
made me feel
like I'd molested you.

-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine.

I should keep my distance.

I didn't know that.

That's funny, I...

1095
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:08,563
I thought that...

1096
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:10,356
Yeah, I know
what you thought.

1097
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:12,400
Stop. Stop.

You disappeared
for three days.

01:42:24,097 --> 01:42:25,389
[in English]
I had to work.

Research at the university.

1114
01:43:17,859 --> 01:43:20,569
Then he'll fly home
from Linate.

1115
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:22,947
But what about Elio?

1116
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:28,243
Maybe it could be nice
for the two of them

just saying that?

We rip out
so much of ourselves
to be cured of things faster,

1288
02:00:11,496 --> 02:00:13,748
that we go bankrupt
by the age of 30.

1289
02:00:15,458 --> 02:00:18,628
And have less to offer,
each time we start
with someone new.

1290
02:00:21,381 --> 02:00:23,257
But to make yourself
feel nothing

1291
02:00:24,092 --> 02:00:25,760
so as not to feel anything.

1292
02:00:27,846 --> 02:00:28,930
What a waste.

I may have come close

but I never had
what you two have.

1298
02:01:00,212 --> 02:01:03,715
Something always held me back

How you live your life
is your business.

Just remember,

1302
02:01:18,646 --> 02:01:21,900
our hearts and our bodies
are given to us only once,

1303
02:01:25,028 --> 02:01:27,864
and before you know it,
your heart's worn out.

1304
02:01:28,615 --> 02:01:31,243
And as for your body,

1305
02:01:31,283 --> 02:01:33,411
there comes a point
when no one looks at it

much less wants
to come near it.

Right now,
there's sorrow, pain.
