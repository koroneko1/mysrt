&lrm;The school sends
&lrm;the 2 students with the highest scores.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.540
&lrm;Why Max?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.540
&lrm;[Kim] Cus he's unbeatable.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.900
&lrm;He's got the highest APM over anyone.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.380
&lrm;-APM?
&lrm;-Actions per minute.

&lrm;Awesome job, we'll make a killer combo.

&lrm;[cheering]

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.940
&lrm;Let me get this straight.
&lrm;If someone beats Max's score,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.620
&lrm;they'll team up with Adrien?

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.580
&lrm;No-one can beat Max,
&lrm;or rather Max and Adrien.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.140
&lrm;It's a slam dunk, they're our dream team.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.820
&lrm;[Marinette squeals]

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.900
&lrm;I see where you're going with this.

&lrm;[excitedly] Just imagine...
&lrm;teaming with Adrien.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.820
&lrm;Are you insane, girl?

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.420
&lrm;This is about stepping up
&lrm;and representing,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.500
&lrm;not snuggling up and snogging.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.220
&lrm;This is serious business.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.540
&lrm;Seriously, Alya,
&lrm;you think I'd go through with it?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.620
&lrm;I think we have our champions...

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.980
&lrm;[Marinette] Wait!

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.820
&lrm;[nervously] Is it too late to try out?

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.540
&lrm;Well, the library is closing

&lrm;Is she serious? There's no way.

&lrm;Unless the player
&lrm;has a particular motivation.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.660
&lrm;The rules are elementary.
&lrm;You battle each other's robot...

&lrm;Let's see if it's enough.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.700
&lrm;[Kim] This'll be fun.

&lrm;[Scoffing] Seriously?

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.220
&lrm;How can you spend
&lrm;so much time in front of a screen?

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.780
&lrm;I know. As if.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.940
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.420

&lrm;And now, quarter circle
&lrm;plus kick and flying hyper-storm.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.860
&lrm;Triple-hit combo,

&lrm;[Marinette cheers] I win.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.300
&lrm;What? I can't believe it.
&lrm;She... she beat him.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.100
&lrm;Beat him? She pulverised him.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.900
&lrm;I accept this defeat.
&lrm;I relinquish my position.

&lrm;Congratulations, Marinette,
&lrm;and Adrien.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.620

&lrm;[sad music]

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.220
&lrm;Look, I'm fine. I lost fair and square,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.620
&lrm;but if you don't mind,
&lrm;I'd like some solitude.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.980
&lrm;So, Marinette and Adrien
&lrm;will represent the school

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.660
&lrm;at the Ultimate Mecha Strike 3 Tournament.
&lrm;Good luck.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.340
&lrm;I guess I'll be coming over to practice
&lrm;with my new partner.

&lrm;You gotta win.
&lrm;You'll be representing the school,

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.460
&lrm;not just hanging out with Adrien.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.100
&lrm;Adrien.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.620

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.740
&lrm;[Max] This is a travesty,

&lrm;an unequivocal travesty.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.980
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] A competition,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.900
&lrm;I know you like that, my little Akumas.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.660

&lrm;Fly away, my little Akuma,
&lrm;and evilise him.

&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.340
&lrm;I should be the one
&lrm;going to that tournament.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.060
&lrm;I worked so hard for it.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.700
&lrm;This is inconceivable.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.380

&lrm;I'll help you win
&lrm;the tournament of your life,

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.900
&lrm;but in return, you must help me
&lrm;achieve my high score.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.980
&lrm;Absolutely, Hawk Moth.
&lrm;Game on!

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.180

&lrm;[excitedly] Training with Adrien, Adrien!

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.980
&lrm;There are other ways
&lrm;to spend time with Adrien.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.220
&lrm;What do you mean?

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.940
&lrm;You know Max wanted
&lrm;to be in that tournament.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.780
&lrm;He's been training all year.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.500
&lrm;You're right.
&lrm;All I could think of was Adrien.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.620
&lrm;Hey, Adrien's coming to my house.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.420
&lrm;[gasping] Adrien's coming... to my house!

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.780
&lrm;This is a total disaster. I have to...

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.740
&lrm;clean my room!

&lrm;That's what
&lrm;I've been trying to tell you.

&lrm;All this... is not...

&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.780
&lrm;Calm down, Marinette,
&lrm;you still have time.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.940
&lrm;He won't show up right now.

&lrm;Someone's here to see you.

&lrm;[panicking] Coming!

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.540
&lrm;Marinette and I are finalists

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.260
&lrm;in the Paris Ultimate
&lrm;Mecha Strike 3 tournament.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.460
&lrm;No way!

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.180
&lrm;Well, she did learn from the best.
&lrm;Tom style, boo-ya!

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.820
&lrm;She never told us
&lrm;about this tournament.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.180
&lrm;We were paired up today.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.980
&lrm;You two are a pair?

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.780
&lrm;I'm not surprised.
&lrm;She talks a lot about you.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.020
&lrm;[Marinette] Mom!

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.580
&lrm;[nervously] Come up, Adrien.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.300
&lrm;Very nice to meet you.

&lrm;[they giggle]

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.540
&lrm;-Sorry,
&lrm;-No, you go.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.140
&lrm;I'LL USE THE OTHER ONE.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.620
&lrm;[nervous giggles]

&lrm;[bleeping]

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.340
&lrm;-Your parents seem nice.
&lrm;-Yeah, they are but sometimes...

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.860
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.940
&lrm;[she shrieks]

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.700
&lrm;Sometimes what?

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.740
&lrm;[knocking]

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.580
&lrm;Everything OK?

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.780
&lrm;Just in case you were hungry...

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.780
&lrm;No, thanks, we're training.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.300
&lrm;Well, maybe you can use a few tips,
&lrm;dad style.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.220
&lrm;Thanks, but no thanks.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.380
&lrm;[irritated] Papa.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.260
&lrm;Sometimes they're a little nosey.

&lrm;[Adrien growls]

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.060
&lrm;Wow! We won again thanks to you.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.700
&lrm;[nervously]
&lrm;Yeah... Yes, we did.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.940
&lrm;We? That was practically all you.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.060
&lrm;You're amazing, Marinette.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.820
&lrm;I guess you wouldn't even need me.
&lrm;I'm so lame compared to you.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.180
&lrm;[hesitantly] No, no... I...

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.900
&lrm;No, you're so good.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.380
&lrm;I mean... I'm the one who's not good.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.060
&lrm;I mean... I'm lucky, that's all.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.100
&lrm;[knocking]

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.980
&lrm;Anyone want cookies,
&lrm;hot from the oven?

&lrm;[Adrien gasps] We're trying to work.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.500
&lrm;[he groans]

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.620
&lrm;Actually, you know what?

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.580
&lrm;I've got a secret.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.300
&lrm;This is why I win.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.780
&lrm;Are you messing with me?

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.180
&lrm;Try playing a match with it.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.300
&lrm;[door opens]

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.140
&lrm;How about a salmon and spinach pie?

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.580
&lrm;Tell me what you think.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.780
&lrm;[Marinette groans]

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.140
&lrm;A little snack wouldn't hurt.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.180
&lrm;[she hesitates and chuckles]

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.860
&lrm;I'm really sorry.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.940
&lrm;I can't get anything done
&lrm;with my parents around.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.820
&lrm;[gulping] It's OK.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.060
&lrm;Your dad makes great pies.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.460
&lrm;[hesitating] Yeah... so shall we go back?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.660
&lrm;Let's see if it works.

&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.900
&lrm;Is this a publicity stunt
&lrm;for the tournament?

&lrm;[bleeping]

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.220
&lrm;[gamer] Well, well...

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.540
&lrm;Marinette,
&lrm;let's see who's victorious this time.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.540
&lrm;It doesn't look like it.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.020
&lrm;[whirring]

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:41.820
&lrm;Look out!

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.260
&lrm;We'd better get outta here.

&lrm;How does he know my name?

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.860
&lrm;Max!

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.660
&lrm;He really did want
&lrm;to be in the tournament.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.780
&lrm;Time to transform.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.740

&lrm;[whimpering]

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.500
&lrm;Game over.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.860
&lrm;Not yet.
&lrm;Here comes a new challenger.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.620
&lrm;Cat Noir, hey!

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.780
&lrm;Over here!

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.300
&lrm;[she gasps]

&lrm;[panting]

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.460
&lrm;I heard you
&lrm;really ticked off the final boss.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.180
&lrm;It doesn't give him extra
&lrm;points to transform everyone.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.620
&lrm;Wait, I left Adrien at the park.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.300
&lrm;We have to go back.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.740
&lrm;[he hesitates]
&lrm;Don't worry, he's not in danger.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.260
&lrm;He'll be fine. You'll be safe here.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.260
&lrm;I'll take care of everything.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.420
&lrm;Arch, leap and do a barrel-roll.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.980
&lrm;He's always so over the top.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.060
&lrm;If ever there was a game to win,
&lrm;this is it.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.540
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

&lrm;[panting]

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.140
&lrm;Get away from here, as far as you can!

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.100
&lrm;[screams] Hurry!

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.940
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Hey, tin can, over here!

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.700
&lrm;My calculations indicate
&lrm;that your system's about to crash.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.340
&lrm;[she yells]

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.860

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.660
&lrm;You're the one crashing, robot.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.060
&lrm;[he yells]

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.780
&lrm;He's a robot from Ultimate Mecha Strike.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.060
&lrm;I know. And it's nearly at level 3,
&lrm;4 is the highest.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.900
&lrm;-Wait, you know that game?
&lrm;-Of course.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.300
&lrm;See? You and me, it was meant to be.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.140
&lrm;[she sighs]

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.460

&lrm;[whirring]
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.340
&lrm;I think our problem got
&lrm;a whole lot bigger.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.220
&lrm;[cheerfully] Level 3.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.060
&lrm;[he cackles]

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.260
&lrm;If you want to be the most
&lrm;powerful robot,

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.740
&lrm;you must capture Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir's Miraculouses.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.580
&lrm;Then it really will be game over.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.100
&lrm;Those Miraculouses are mine.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.580

&lrm;We have to stop him
&lrm;before he destroys Paris.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.940
&lrm;THE STADIUM!

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.860

&lrm;[thud]

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:39.860
&lrm;[they yell]

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.020
&lrm;[he cackles]

&lrm;[zapping]

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.460
&lrm;Attack him with your Cataclysm power,

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.060
&lrm;It might shock him.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.660
&lrm;My pleasure. Two can play this game.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.300
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.620

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.580
&lrm;[agonising cry] No!

&lrm;[groaning]

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.180
&lrm;Smack-down, Cat Noir.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.540
&lrm;Cat Noir style, boo-ya!

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.540
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.900
&lrm;Check out that loot!

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.260
&lrm;System crash, Gamer!

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.940
&lrm;[he cackles]
&lrm;You've forgotten the rules.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.220
&lrm;I saved my last level.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.020

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.340
&lrm;[Ladybug sighs]

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.620
&lrm;Re-spawn!

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.140
&lrm;Not the old spawn point glitch again.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.220
&lrm;Did you see him press his glasses?
&lrm;I bet the Akuma's in there.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.700
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.700
&lrm;[Marinette] We've levelled up too.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.940
&lrm;I don't have long left.
