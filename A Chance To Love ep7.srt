00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,079
I like you.

2
00:00:01,595 --> 00:00:03,123
I know that.

3
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,542
I'm hitting on you.

4
00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:05,957
You can hit on me.

5
00:00:06,037 --> 00:00:07,431
You can like me.

6
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:08,476
I just...

7
00:00:08,556 --> 00:00:11,933
I still don't know
if I'm okay with you or not.

8
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,820
What is love?

9
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,034
It means Pete.

10
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,927
Why all I can see is pain?

11
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,960
I don't want to be like you, Ae.

12
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,926
-Why are you avoiding me?
-Who's avoiding you?

13
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:24,486
-You're over-thinking.
-You do.

14
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,694
But I'm glad.

15
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:27,759
Because that means
you're actually thinking about me.

16
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:28,925
What is it?

17
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:31,158
Will you be boyfriend, Can?

18
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:55,693
What's wrong?

19
00:00:55,773 --> 00:00:57,133
I don't understand.

20
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:00,422
Which part don't you understand?

21
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,390
I don't know.

22
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,162
I don't know if I like you or not.

23
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:07,096
We can go out and eat
and watch movies together.

24
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:08,505
Isn't that enough?

25
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:10,982
Why do we have to be in a relationship?

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,600
Because you're the air I breathe.

27
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,364
When I'm with my family,

28
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:23,500
I feel like I'm drowning.

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,366
I can't breathe.

30
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:29,390
I'm suffocating.

Ae is still sad.
I don't want to be like him.

00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:01,235
I'm not the owner of this university.

183
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,577
The University Football Tournament
is coming soon.

184
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:18,514
You guys have to work harder.

185
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:21,897
Do you remember
the pain of losing last time?

186
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:23,532
We won't lose again this time.

187
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,090
But I'm not sad at all.

188
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:29,193
Because I just joined the team this year.

189
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:32,519
You and Can are the same.

190
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,240
Come on.

191
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,101
You shouldn't spoil them too much.

192
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:38,496
Type ditched me to be with his husband
is already bad enough.

193
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:39,872
Damn you.

194
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:41,811
Whatever. Just do what you want.

195
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:44,404
Where is the little monkey?

196
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:45,415
Where did he go?

197
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,534
Shit!

198
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:55,519
Since when did you come?

199
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:58,112
Why are you sneaking up on me?
You scared me.

200
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,324
What's wrong with you?

201
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:02,277
You look so gloomy
like someone uses black magic on you.

202
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,300
Can you help me eat this?

203
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:08,717
I bought it but I've lost my appetite now.

204
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:11,068
Someone like you has that feeling?

205
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,694
How can someone like him lose appetite?

206
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:31,753
You guys can go to practice now.

207
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,280
Hey.

208
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,336
Ae.

209
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,423
You're not going back yet?

210
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:12,719
It's already late.

211
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:14,193
What time is it now?

212
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,693
It's already 9:30 PM.

213
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,336
Techno is so harsh.

214
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:23,509
I want to know between going
into the final match or dying,

215
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,881
which one will come first.

216
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:28,732
I'm so tired today.

217
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:31,959
Tin.

218
00:17:37,137 --> 00:17:39,600
What's wrong with you?
Why did you suddenly say his name?

219
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,322
You've become like this...

220
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:47,249
...because of him, right?

221
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,981
Is it because
my answer wasn't clear enough?

222
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:59,393
What question?

223
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:01,198
I didn't ask you any questions.

224
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:03,942
You're going crazy
because you're missing Pete too much.

225
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,387
Do you even look at yourself?

226
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:09,055
You're sad about Tin.

227
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,971
You're going crazy as well.

228
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:15,525
Listen to me, Can.

229
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,389
I told you that my love means Pete.

230
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:22,522
If he stands right here in front of me,

231
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,562
I won't hesitate to pull him in for a hug.

232
00:18:27,502 --> 00:18:28,663
I'll protect him.

233
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,656
I'll always be by his side.

234
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:34,762
Even if your brain can't understand that,

235
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:38,409
but your heart should know.

236
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,817
You should talk to him.

237
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,400
Trust me.

238
00:18:58,244 --> 00:18:59,340
Okay.

239
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,586
I'll talk to him.

240
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:07,777
Thank you so much.

241
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,735
You're my best friend.

242
00:19:11,815 --> 00:19:13,010
I've got your back.

243
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,716
I'll get changed then.

244
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:37,337
I wish you're here with me.

245
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:00,289
Techno.

246
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,283
Don't run away from me.

247
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:06,508
I'm not.

248
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:08,886
I'm not running away.

249
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:11,172
You're over-thinking, Kla.

250
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,498
You're never home when I go to see you.

251
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,273
You also jumped out of the window
to avoid me.

252
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:22,046
That doesn't mean
you're running away from me?

253
00:20:22,844 --> 00:20:25,834
I jumped off the balcony not window...

254
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,206
Is there anything else you want to say?

255
00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:34,582
I want to go home and rest now.

256
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,649
I really like you, Techno.

257
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:52,137
I admitted that I lied to you.

258
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,098
I lied that you're the one
who started it first.

259
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,189
But there's one thing
that I never lie to you.

260
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,560
It's that I really like you.

261
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,000
I like you for such a long time.

262
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,620
I like you since the first day we met.

263
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,640
But you did lie to me.

264
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,160
That's still the truth.

265
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,511
I've told you.

266
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:28,818
I have nothing to say to you right now.

267
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:30,643
I've got to go.

268
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,221
Techno.

269
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:38,509
What else do you want?

270
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,193
At least, please let me take you home.

271
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,130
Please.

272
00:22:15,488 --> 00:22:16,584
Is this his car?

273
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:22,045
He's not going home yet?

274
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:27,900
How should I start a conversation?

275
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:42,893
It's so late now.

276
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,259
I'd get into trouble
if you didn't help me.

277
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:57,244
You also give me a ride.

278
00:22:57,324 --> 00:22:58,421
Thank you so much.

279
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,086
I shouldn't hide behind his car.

280
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,114
Tum.

281
00:23:45,194 --> 00:23:46,224
Look at this.

282
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,760
This guy that I told you about.
He posted it again.

283
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:53,113
I told you about him before.
He always posts a photo every day.

284
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:55,588
His caption is like,
he's talking to someone.

285
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,624
But he never tags anyone.

286
00:23:58,098 --> 00:23:59,712
I was going through his FB.

287
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,549
He actually posts like this every day.

288
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:03,534
It's like his diary.

289
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:06,245
He posts where he goes, what he does,
and who he hangs out with.

290
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:07,522
You should take a look.

291
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:12,872
I don't think that's weird.

292
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:15,123
People who use FB always do that.

293
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,680
Then...

294
00:24:17,073 --> 00:24:18,606
Why do you think he's interesting?

295
00:24:18,686 --> 00:24:20,592
I don't know. You should go through it.

296
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:23,976
It's like he wants to say something.

297
00:24:24,056 --> 00:24:25,485
He's telling what's going on in his life.

298
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:26,685
But if you're not interested...

299
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,946
Who told you I'm not?

300
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:30,116
-You said...
-I'm just asking.

301
00:24:30,196 --> 00:24:31,606
I believe in you.

302
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:33,969
Should we go to meet him?

303
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,521
How?

304
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,734
He's an engineering student
from our university.

305
00:24:37,814 --> 00:24:39,018
It won't be hard to find him.

306
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,348
Okay.

307
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:43,483
If you think that's a good idea,
then I think so too.

308
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:44,461
Great.

309
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:24,946
Dude.

310
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,012
I think I got it.

311
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,109
I think this plan is okay.

312
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:34,779
This strategy will work.

313
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:36,790
I agree with whatever you say.

314
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,378
Thanks, bro.

315
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:48,360
I believe that if we win this match,

316
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,500
we'll have a chance to become a champion.

317
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:57,060
This one is hot and spicy.

318
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,242
Tin.

319
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:06,345
Tin.

320
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:08,980
Why are you walking so fast? Wait for me.

321
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,979
Thank you for dropping me off last night
in front of the university.

322
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:16,760
My friends are terrible.

323
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,612
They wouldn't wait for me.

324
00:26:18,692 --> 00:26:20,517
That's why I have to bother you.

325
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:21,577
Thank you so much.

326
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,091
Calm down, Can. Quit imagining things.

327
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:27,730
I have to talk to Tin first.

328
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:29,681
Tin.

329
00:26:29,981 --> 00:26:31,017
Can I ask you something?

330
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,129
Do you have a girlfriend?

331
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:37,423
I don't.

332
00:26:38,226 --> 00:26:39,512
Well...

333
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,971
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

334
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,040
I'll never choose you to be my girlfriend.

335
00:27:05,522 --> 00:27:06,924
Now stop bothering me.

336
00:27:07,354 --> 00:27:08,425
It's annoying.

337
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,600
Damn it!

338
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:21,481
Give me a ball!

339
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,226
You're pretentious! What a show-off!

340
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,962
Give it to me!

341
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:42,429
You said that I'm the air you breathe!

342
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:44,414
Then why are you breathing in
from someone else?

343
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,175
Give me a ball!

344
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:48,367
I don't have it!

345
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:50,487
How come? I have to practice!

346
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:51,938
Damn it!

347
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,951
I've been collecting balls for you
for half an hour already.

348
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:54,940
Look around!

349
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,467
You should collect them by yourself.
I'm off.

350
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,835
Didn't you say you like me?

351
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:11,741
Job.

352
00:30:12,318 --> 00:30:13,229
Come here.

353
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:18,716
Dude.

354
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:20,272
What's wrong with Can?

355
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:21,822
I wonder too.

356
00:30:21,902 --> 00:30:23,384
He's been like this for a week.

357
00:30:23,464 --> 00:30:25,144
I told him to rest but he wouldn't listen.

358
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:26,958
Is he okay?

359
00:30:28,874 --> 00:30:29,959
How can he be okay?

360
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,165
He practices too hard.

361
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:33,085
I think he wants to win
the World Championship.

362
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,517
Well...

363
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:39,838
You should stop him.

364
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,101
Do you think he will listen?

365
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,184
I know that I'm handsome and cool,
but I can't do everything you say.

366
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,437
Why don't you ask Ae to stop him?

367
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:53,233
He listens to Ae more than me.

368
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:56,142
Ae, you should stop him.

369
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,268
Look.

370
00:30:57,348 --> 00:30:59,521
He's not a little monkey anymore.
He's wild like a dog.

371
00:31:18,954 --> 00:31:19,860
Ae!

372
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,801
Something's wrong with him too?

373
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:33,940
Why don't you guys talk?

374
00:31:40,591 --> 00:31:41,942
It's none of your business.

375
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:56,226
He practices too hard.

376
00:31:57,845 --> 00:31:59,405
If you're worried, why don't you go in?

377
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,436
How can I do that?

378
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:14,460
Why not?

379
00:32:16,343 --> 00:32:18,071
Can is right in front of you.

380
00:32:20,776 --> 00:32:22,587
The day that you lose him by your side,

381
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:25,502
it will be the worst pain.

382
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,625
He doesn't like me
the way that Pete likes you.

383
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,385
How do you know...

384
00:32:42,192 --> 00:32:43,669
...that Can doesn't really like you?

385
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,939
We have a match tomorrow.

386
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:56,708
You should come.

387
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:59,358
I think he wants you to come.

388
00:33:02,238 --> 00:33:03,480
Why are you helping me?

389
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:07,888
Why did you help me
when Pete's dad was going to expel me?

390
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:12,587
Pete asked for my help.

391
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,102
That's right.

392
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:16,012
Because you're his friend.

393
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,080
Give him some time.

394
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,250
If he doesn't understand,

395
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:30,625
it doesn't mean he has no feelings.

396
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,740
What's wrong with you?

397
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,431
I'm nervous!

398
00:34:10,511 --> 00:34:11,953
We'll start playing soon.

399
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,747
Why are you nervous?

400
00:34:14,827 --> 00:34:16,385
You're just a substitute.

401
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:18,636
So what? I'm nervous.

402
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:23,268
Are you guys ready?

403
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,880
Let's go out there and win this match!

404
00:34:29,593 --> 00:34:30,990
Let's go!

405
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,118
Get up!

406
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:47,651
(Do your best.)

407
00:35:09,895 --> 00:35:11,310
Ae, get the ball!

408
00:35:36,377 --> 00:35:37,314
Go!

409
00:35:37,394 --> 00:35:38,527
Run!

410
00:35:38,774 --> 00:35:39,918
Go!

411
00:36:00,797 --> 00:36:01,804
Techno!

412
00:36:06,324 --> 00:36:07,645
Are you okay?

413
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:10,721
I can't get up. It hurts.

414
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:21,884
Can, are you ready to get on the field?

415
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:24,422
-But Techno...
-Come on.

416
00:36:25,311 --> 00:36:26,542
Fight for the team.

417
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:27,562
Go!

418
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:40,954
Can!

419
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:41,974
For the team!

420
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:44,840
-Go!
-Okay.

421
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,134
You can do it.

422
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:02,788
Can.

423
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,613
Tin.

424
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:10,993
Come here.

425
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:17,678
Why do we have to lose?

426
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:20,183
We practiced so hard.

427
00:39:20,263 --> 00:39:22,414
We practiced every day.

428
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,450
We played only two matches.

429
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,631
I want to cry.

430
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,629
You're crying now.

431
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:37,874
I want to cry more.

432
00:39:39,283 --> 00:39:40,735
You can do that.

433
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:43,832
I will keep crying.

434
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,014
You can cry so you can forget about it.

435
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:52,910
You can cry in front of me.

436
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:55,789
Tin.

437
00:39:56,918 --> 00:39:58,703
I'm sorry.

438
00:40:00,717 --> 00:40:02,673
It's not that I don't like you.

439
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,423
Please don't disappear again.

440
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,334
