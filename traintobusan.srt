00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,659
Next entertainment world presents

2
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:37,162
a redpeter film production

3
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,127
executive producer Kim woo-taek

00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,141
producer Lee dongha

00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:09,152
quarantine zone slow down

6
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,388
what's this?

7
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,099
Gonna bury them hogs again?

8
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,685
It's not foot-and-mouth disease.

9
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,606
There was a minor leak in the biotech district.

10
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,234
- It's nothing.
- You said that before!

11
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,572
If you bury my livestock again,

12
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,908
I'll really go mad!

13
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,704
Don't you worry, and go right ahead.

14
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,374
Go on.

15
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,049
"Tiny leak", my hairy ass.

16
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,886
They're so full of shit.

17
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,116
What the...

18
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,753
Such a shit day.

19
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:43,432
Train to busan

20
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,517
sir,

21
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:49,813
if we pull out now, the market will suffer.

22
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,276
This could be based on a false report...

23
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,614
Yes, right away.

24
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,616
Pardon?

25
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,996
No, not at all. I'm still a novice.

26
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,708
Okay. I'll see you on the field.

27
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,586
Yes, take care.

28
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,729
Send Kim in.

29
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:38,987
Mysterious fish deaths at jinyang reservoir

30
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,580
what should we do?

31
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,124
Sell all related funds.

32
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,585
- Everything?
- Yeah.

33
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,380
There will be serious repercussions.

34
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:00,133
Market stability and individual traders will...

35
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,469
- Kim.
- Sir?

36
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,889
Do you work for the lemmings?

37
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,726
Sell everything. Right away.

38
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,062
Yes, sir.

39
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,358
One minute.

40
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,072
What are kids into these days?

41
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:31,123
Let's not waste time suing each other.

42
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,168
I don't care what you do with your time.

43
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,294
I'm raising su-an.

44
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,130
How are you raising her?

45
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,591
Do you even talk to her?

46
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,595
She wants to come here tomorrow by herself!

47
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,846
Did you know that?

48
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,098
Stop this bullshit!

49
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,893
You call yourself a father?

50
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,895
A child can't go alone.

51
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,523
Then bring her here. She wants to come.

52
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,358
Not tomorrow.

53
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,903
You know it's her birthday tomorrow, right?

54
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,905
Of course!

55
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,101
- Did you eat?
- Kind of.

56
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,811
Where's su-an?

57
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:39,107
She's in her room.

58
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,195
I can ride the train by myself.

59
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,407
You can come pick me up at the station!

60
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,121
Mommy, I'm hanging up.

61
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,720
It's okay, you can talk to her.

62
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,430
I hung up.

63
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,186
You told her you wanted to go to busan?

64
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:21,024
Sweetie, I have so much work lately.

65
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,486
I'll have more time next week.

66
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,822
Could you wait till then?

67
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,456
Here.

68
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,797
What. Thought I forgot? Happy birthday.

69
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,176
Go on, open it.

70
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:07,196
What, you don't like it?

71
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,504
Children's day this year.

72
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:32,262
Is there anything else you want?

73
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:37,392
Busan. I want to see mommy.

74
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:38,936
Tomorrow.

75
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:43,148
I told you, another time, okay?

76
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,651
No, tomorrow.

77
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:50,030
You always say next time, and lie to me.

78
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:55,911
I won't waste your time. I can go alone.

79
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,295
Are you busy nowadays?

80
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,548
You know how it is.

81
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:12,177
So you'll take her to busan tomorrow?

82
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,639
- Yes.
- That's good.

83
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,601
While you're down there...

84
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:26,817
Have a heart-to-heart talk with your wife.

85
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:31,572
A marriage shouldn't be abandoned so easily.

86
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,367
For su-an's sake, too.

87
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,579
Mom, I'll take care of it.

88
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,834
It's a crucial period right now.

89
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:50,549
Sure. You know best.

90
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:58,015
She was disappointed
that you weren't at the recital.

91
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:03,061
It's a crucial period for her, too.

92
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:33,008
Proudly swept the rain by the cliffs

93
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:41,225
as it glided through the trees

94
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,144
still...

95
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,563
It's fine.

96
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,107
Baby, it's okay.

97
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,610
Su-an, go on.

98
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,711
Yeah, mom.

99
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,463
Yeah.

100
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,675
No, with dad.

101
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,053
Okay, bye.

102
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,889
See you soon. Bye.

103
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:39,616
I saw you sing at the school recital.

104
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,203
When did you see it? You weren't there.

105
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:49,001
I may look like I'm not there,
but I'm always watching you.

106
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,255
You didn't finish, right?

107
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,132
Right.

108
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,303
Why was that? You should've finished it.

109
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:04,558
Whatever you do, you must finish what you start...

110
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,102
It's worse than not doing it at...

111
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,449
Jesus...

112
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,830
What's going on this early?

113
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,381
Are you okay?

114
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,676
That startled me.

115
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,315
Looks like something's happening.

116
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,831
Attention, please.

117
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:14,878
Ktx 101 bound for busan is departing shortly.

118
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:19,508
- Where is car 4?
- Car 4 is that way.

119
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,134
Thank you.

120
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,262
Attention, please.

121
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:29,184
Ktx 101 bound for busan is departing shortly.

122
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,788
Hye-young, hey!

123
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,623
Your scarf.

124
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,708
Adjust it, please.

125
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,009
Everyone be quiet and sit down!

126
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,510
Okay!

127
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,723
Look, it's Jin-hee!

128
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,352
Hey, what are you doing here?

129
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,605
I'm your cheerleader.

130
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,398
- Are you serious?
- Didn't you hear?

131
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,567
That's awesome. You got your wish.

132
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,528
- Sit with me.
- Do your best!

133
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,364
Hey, Jin-hee.

134
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,410
What're you listening to?

135
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,165
Go sit somewhere else.

136
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,750
It's not even on.

137
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:40,380
If I tell you I like you, just say "thank you."

138
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,590
It's your fate.

139
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,593
That's right! It's fate!

140
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:48,514
Accept her! Accept her!

141
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,058
Accept her!

142
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,064
Jong-Gil, here.

143
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,608
When did you boil this?

144
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,236
We'll arrive in an hour, what's the point?

145
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,237
Don't want it.

146
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,239
- Take it.
- No way.

147
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,784
Mr. suh, are you on the train?

148
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,369
Yes, what is it?

149
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,579
We've been getting a lot of calls.

150
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,249
There was a strike at ansan industrial park.

151
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,376
What?

152
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:22,881
Prep a situation report for me.

153
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,591
I'll be back before lunch.

154
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,634
Yes, sir.

155
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,825
I'm sorry... I am...

156
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,953
I'm sorry...

157
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,122
I'm so sorry...

158
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,791
I'm really sorry.

159
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,720
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

160
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,389
Good morning.

161
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,642
I think someone... odd... got on board.

162
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,809
Where?

163
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,312
He's in the washroom.

164
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,273
I don't know what he's doing.

165
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,400
It's been a while.

166
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:09,446
Our apologies. We'll check right away.

167
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,208
Excuse me?

168
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:24,545
Hello?

169
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,508
Sir?

170
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,393
All dead... everyone...

171
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:40,978
Sir?

172
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,355
Excuse me?

173
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,899
May I check your ticket?

174
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,193
All dead...

175
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:51,154
Sir, if you do not have a ticket,

176
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:54,616
you'll be escorted off at the next station.

177
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,286
Everyone's dead!

178
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,247
Pardon?

179
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,375
All dead...

180
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,798
Hey, kiddo.

181
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,885
If you don't study, you'll end up like him.

182
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,681
Mom said whoever says that is a bad person.

183
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,727
She must've flunked school.

184
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:26,648
Sir, please come out. We'll move to the back.

185
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,560
Urgent?

186
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,439
Two people are pissing, so it'll take a bit.

187
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,025
There. Use that washroom.

188
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,151
Go on.

189
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,073
This'll take a bit.

190
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,368
Honey, how's it going in there?

191
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:23,789
Sorry. I'm sorry. No worries.

192
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:24,998
Take your time.

193
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,708
Go over there.

194
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,838
Take it easy, she's gone.

195
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,297
Relax.

196
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,267
Miss, are you okay?

197
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:44,434
Miss!

198
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,978
Oh god...

199
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,898
A passenger requiring medical attention in car 11.

200
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,358
Chief?

201
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,456
- Hello?
- Yes, Kim?

202
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,042
It's more serious than we anticipated.

203
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,295
It's not just an overnight ansan incident.

204
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:15,674
I don't know what's happening,
but it's not a simple strike.

205
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:16,008
Military deployed to control riots

206
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,051
they say it's nationwide.

207
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,761
- Is it airborne?
- Hello?

208
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,639
- Is she breathing?
- Yes, she is.

209
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,558
But the seizures are uncontrollable!

210
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,227
Sir, what should we do?

211
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,396
I'll call you back.

212
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,573
Indiscriminate violence at riot

213
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,950
oh no, they'll get hurt.

214
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,702
That's terrible.

215
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:46,955
People nowadays will riot over anything.

216
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,791
In the old days, they'd be re-educated.

217
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,752
You mustn't say that.

218
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,713
Look, look.

219
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:57,674
What's up with them?

220
00:20:59,051 --> 00:20:59,843
Miss?

221
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:03,263
What do I do...

222
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,311
Chief? Where are you?

223
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,774
I don't believe this...

224
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,743
Chief?

225
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,261
Min-ji? Hello?

226
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,000
What is it?

227
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:17,963
What's happening?

228
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,134
Holy shit!

229
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,355
One moment, please!

230
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,423
Hurry! Everyone run!

231
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:06,845
Conductor, we have a situation!

232
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:10,432
Sir, violence broke out in the cabin!

233
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,571
Run!

234
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,969
- Oh my god!
- What the hell?!

235
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,356
Get away! Just go!

236
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,116
Get out of here! Head for the back!

237
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:10,826
Get up! Hurry!

238
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,057
Daddy!

239
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:17,434
Baby?

240
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,104
Sang-hwa! So damn loud!

241
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,065
Sorry, the thing is...

242
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,566
Get off me!

243
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:37,996
You idiot! Go help her!

244
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,500
Hey!

245
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,417
What's with you?!

246
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,173
Are you nuts?

247
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,273
Baby?

248
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,358
Sung-kyung!

249
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:10,362
You can run, right?

250
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:29,590
Massive violence, increasing casualties

251
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,884
get away!

252
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,229
Get the door! The door!

253
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,232
Shut the door!

254
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:49,860
Quick!

255
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:51,987
Shut it!

256
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:54,698
Shut it now!

257
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,910
Just shut it!

258
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,877
I know him!

259
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,683
Where's the lock?

260
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:24,520
Buddy! How do I lock this?

261
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,190
Do you hear me?!

262
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,695
Let it go.

263
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:34,780
What?

264
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:40,369
I don't think they know how to work it.

265
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,381
They attacked when they saw us.

266
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,319
What in the...

267
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:16,822
What are they?

268
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,202
Su-an, you okay?

269
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:24,997
Hey, buddy.

270
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,291
What is it?

271
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,502
Think you might owe me an apology?

272
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:32,129
What do you mean?

273
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,755
Look at this chump.

274
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:37,259
You shut the door in our faces, asshole!

275
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:40,012
You weren't the only ones in danger!

276
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,015
What a piece of work.

277
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:44,641
Come over here.

278
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,393
I'll feed you to them.

279
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,853
Stop it!

280
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,688
Everyone's just scared.

281
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,445
Attention, please.

282
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:01,825
Due to the current situation,
we will no longer be stopping in cheonan.

283
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:05,871
For your safety, please remain in your seats.

284
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:13,378
Hello? Anyone there?

285
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,422
Yes, go ahead.

286
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:19,343
Do you even know what's going on back here?

287
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,094
Why aren't you stopping in cheonan?

288
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,554
We are aware, sir.

289
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:26,141
This is an order from our control center.

290
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:27,476
Please be seated.

291
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,189
That's nonsense! People are going rabid!

292
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,983
Stop in cheonan, got it?!

293
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,819
Excuse me.

294
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:44,201
I'm really sorry, but could she sit down?

295
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,661
She's pregnant.

296
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:46,620
Okay.

297
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:47,538
Sit, sit.

298
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:48,705
Thank you.

299
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,833
Mother

300
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:53,418
mom.

301
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:57,297
Are you on your way?

302
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,800
Yes, we're en route.

303
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,719
Where are you? Why is it so loud?

304
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:06,723
What's happening? Everyone's fighting.

305
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:10,811
Are you and su-an okay?

306
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:14,064
Why're you breathing like that? Are you hurt?

307
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,484
Seok-woo, my baby.

308
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:22,781
Please take care of su-an.

309
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,575
Mom, you okay?

310
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:28,704
My dear su-an...

311
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:37,713
I love her so much, but she only wants her mom...

312
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,301
That bitch!

313
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,310
Mom?

314
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:54,730
Dad.

315
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:58,275
Dad!

316
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,321
Is granny okay?

317
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:12,915
What the hell?

318
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,417
Sweetie, sit down.

319
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:01,964
My fellow citizens.

320
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:09,137
Violent riots have broken out in
a number of our major cities,

321
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:14,142
resulting in multiple civilian
and police injuries.

322
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:19,231
These riots have led us to shut down
a number of key districts,

323
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:23,861
in an effort to subdue those attempting to destroy

324
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,947
or take over government property.

325
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:32,369
For this reason, we're declaring
a state of emergency

326
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:39,293
in order to stabilize
and control the current situation.

327
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:47,926
Thanks to our government's rapid response,

328
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:52,014
a number of outbreaks are being contained.

329
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,808
Fellow citizens,

330
00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:00,522
please refrain from reacting to baseless rumors,

331
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:06,612
zombie
and stay in the safety of your homes.

332
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:09,907
We must stay calm and trust our government,

333
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:13,452
as we all work together
in facing this current crisis.

334
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:18,540
To the best of our knowledge,
your safety is not in jeopardy.

335
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:35,432
Analyst Kim

336
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:42,523
mommy's phone is off.

337
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:49,238
Those in the front, hurry up!

338
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,323
Su-an, sit over here.

339
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:54,201
Don't worry, I'll give her a call.

340
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:57,496
Jong-Gil, come sit down.

341
00:33:57,663 --> 00:33:59,873
You're older. You sit down.

342
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:01,124
I'm fine. Take it.

343
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,043
Baby, let's go over there.

344
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:10,092
Ma'am, please take my seat.

345
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:13,262
- I'm okay.
- No, please sit.

346
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:18,350
Child.

347
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,561
Would you like one?

348
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:24,898
Thank you.

349
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,692
What a great kid.

350
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:33,949
- We both got seats.
- Keep walking.

351
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,201
That bag...

352
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,913
Su-an, you didn't have to do that.

353
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,000
- Do what?
- Be so good.

354
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:46,503
At a time like this, only watch out for yourself.

355
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:50,924
Answer me.

356
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:59,183
Granny's knees always hurt her.

357
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:02,102
Sweetie...

358
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:10,027
May I have your attention, please.

359
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:14,239
Our train will terminate service
at daejeon station.

360
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:19,953
Military is deployed at this location
to secure our train,

361
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:24,166
so once we arrive, please exit the train.

362
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,876
I repeat,

363
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,795
daejeon station will be our last stop.

364
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,089
Which cities can be entered?

365
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:34,510
Yeosu, uljin, busan. What about daejeon?

366
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,178
Excuse me, I need to use it.

367
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,263
What about daejeon?

368
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,015
Why not?!

369
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:44,228
Sweetie, stay put.

370
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,483
Hey, kiddo.

371
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:50,359
Yes?

372
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,486
Who is this? Your dad?

373
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:54,071
Yes.

374
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:55,823
- Real dad?
- Yes.

375
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:58,450
I wanna know.

376
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,452
What does he do?

377
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:02,830
He's a fund manager.

378
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:05,249
- Fund manager?
- Yes.

379
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,085
So he's a bloodsucker.

380
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:10,504
He leeches off others.

381
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:13,799
Don't say that in front of his child.

382
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,092
It's okay.

383
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:18,595
It's what everyone's thinking.

384
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:25,853
Want some?

385
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,814
It's what sleepy eats.

386
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:32,693
This is sleepy. Say hello.

387
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:36,280
Baby's name is sleepy?

388
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,739
No, the fetus' name.

389
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:39,992
It's like a nickname.

390
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:44,580
Her dad's too lazy to come up with a name yet.

391
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:47,666
Touch her belly.

392
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,334
Right here.

393
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:51,753
Go on.

394
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:58,218
Feel that?

395
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:01,889
I made that.

396
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:07,728
- You idiot...
- But it's true. No?

397
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,606
Lemmings

398
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:14,109
daejeon lt. Min

399
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:23,785
Mr. suh, you've called me at a bad time.

400
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,037
Wait, wait!

401
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,080
Let me ask you something.

402
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:28,290
What?

403
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,168
I'm on ktx to daejeon.

404
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,172
Ktx? Right this minute?

405
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,049
Yes, I'm almost there.

406
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:41,053
Is it true military is deployed in daejeon?

407
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:44,056
Yes, that's correct.

408
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:48,435
Is that so? It must be safe there.

409
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,147
Well... it's...

410
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:57,486
Min. It is safe, right?

411
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:02,741
Once you arrive, you'll be quarantined.

412
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,159
What?

413
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:09,957
I'm with my daughter.

414
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:14,545
Can you help us?

415
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,089
The thing is...

416
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,009
I'll get you a real scoop. Do me this favor.

417
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:26,849
Don't go to the main square. Come to the east one.

418
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,684
I'll let my men know.

419
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:32,396
Okay, thank you. Thank you so much.

420
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:42,197
All dead...

421
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,590
What's going on?

422
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:00,716
So quiet...

423
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:01,884
Is it daejeon?

424
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:10,475
There's nobody.

425
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,020
Why isn't anyone here?

426
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:32,206
Out of my way.

427
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,132
What's going on back there?

428
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,514
This is the violent incident I told you about.

429
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:31,682
Conductor!

430
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:33,267
- You're the conductor?
- Yes.

431
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:35,477
How many can fit in the engine car?

432
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,313
We have to uncouple it and go to busan.

433
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:39,439
- Uncouple?
- Yes!

434
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:41,275
- We can't!
- Why not?!

435
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:42,985
It can't be done here.

436
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,655
Then where's the military?

437
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:47,698
Right...

438
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,950
I only just received a report on that...

439
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:52,161
Where's my business card...

440
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:55,622
I'm coo of stallion express.

441
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:58,083
All routes into daejeon are cut off.

442
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,835
All buses were rerouted.

443
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:01,086
But what for?

444
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:03,463
The city's been quarantined!

445
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,591
They probably won't let us in.

446
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:10,220
But busan is still open! Let's go there!

447
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,723
Wait, if that's true...

448
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,642
- We have to take the others.
- Take who?

449
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,853
Let's check the station first.

450
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:19,354
Hey!

451
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:23,317
Dammit!

452
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:48,258
Restricted area

453
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:07,653
don't mind them.

454
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,660
Come on, sweetie.

455
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:15,869
Where are we going?

456
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,455
We're going this way.

457
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:21,834
- Just us?
- Yes. Let's go.

458
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:29,091
What is it?

459
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:32,386
I'm going this way, too.

460
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:35,889
Main square is that way, just follow the others.

461
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:37,808
I think I'll be going with you.

462
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,602
I heard your call.

463
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:43,272
About pulling you two out.

464
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:47,276
I know the others go in quarantine.

465
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:50,779
It's not true, su-an.

466
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:52,364
I'll go tell the others.

467
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:56,076
- You don't have to.
- Of course I do!

468
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:58,787
Forget them! We're on our own!

469
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:04,168
You only care about yourself.

470
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:10,382
That's why mommy left.

471
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:30,444
Sweetie...

472
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:36,533
Here! Over here!

473
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,660
Please help!

474
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:41,079
Sweetie, stay right here.

475
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,768
Goddammit!

476
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:05,979
Hold on!

477
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:19,076
Go back up! Go! Go!

478
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:37,970
Lt. Min!

479
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:39,471
- Mr. suh!
- I'm in daejeon.

480
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:42,015
Is everything okay there? I can't contact my men!

481
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:43,225
What?

482
00:44:43,642 --> 00:44:44,393
Hello?

483
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:46,144
Help me...

484
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:49,731
Please...

485
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:22,014
Come on, hurry!

486
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:28,812
Come on! Hurry!

487
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:43,911
Hurry up! Quick!

488
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:46,455
Take this!

489
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:05,974
Run! Come on!

490
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:12,523
Asshole! Come on!

491
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:21,949
Faster!

492
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:25,536
Hold them off!

493
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:02,990
- Over here! Run!
- This way! Hurry!

494
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:04,533
Here!

495
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,580
This way!

496
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:11,748
Come on!

497
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:12,875
Hurry!

498
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,460
Why aren't we leaving yet?!

499
00:47:15,794 --> 00:47:17,421
There's still more people!

500
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:18,672
Hurry up!

501
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:21,341
Come this way!

502
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,011
Hurry!

503
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:25,554
Faster! Here!

504
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:40,319
Granny!

505
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:42,321
Please get up!

506
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:52,789
No, stop!

507
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:55,876
My sister!

508
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:04,635
Hop on!

509
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:25,614
Me too!

510
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:28,116
Let me in!

511
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,660
Please!

512
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:50,138
How much longer? We've got to go!

513
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:51,640
No! My friends aren't here yet!

514
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:55,811
Those on board must survive!

515
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,145
Ain't that right?

516
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:05,195
Conductor.

517
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:08,365
Please... depart.

518
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:30,888
Run! Let's go!

519
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:47,946
Look, the train!

520
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:48,947
Run faster!

521
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:10,135
Snap out of it, idiot!

522
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:40,749
Watch out!

523
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:06,316
Control, 101 could not dock
at daejeon due to outbreak.

524
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:09,903
Please advise which station
is available for docking, over.

525
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:14,700
101, due to unstable communications
it is difficult to advise.

526
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:20,080
Control, is 101 clear to reach busan? Over.

527
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:25,836
101, we'll clear your route to busan.

528
00:51:26,128 --> 00:51:27,713
Control center, out.

529
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:31,800
Advise when you make contact with busan.

530
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:33,927
101, out.

531
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:51,922
Attention, everyone.

532
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:57,302
For the safety of those on board,
we won't be making any stops.

533
00:52:57,594 --> 00:52:59,847
We're heading straight for busan.

534
00:53:00,931 --> 00:53:03,517
Conductor, can you hear me?

535
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:05,018
Go ahead.

536
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:06,812
Were you able to contact busan?

537
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:09,815
No. Busan's communications are erratic.

538
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:13,735
Full speed-no matter what!

539
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:16,446
Or we won't get in. Understand?

540
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,831
Young-guk, where are you?

541
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:31,253
I thought you were dead!

542
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:33,172
I'm sorry.

543
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:37,092
No one else made it!

544
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:39,469
I'm sorry...

545
00:53:50,606 --> 00:53:52,983
- Baby?
- Mister!

546
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:56,570
Huh? Why are you answering? Where are you?

547
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,697
We're in the train washroom!

548
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,658
Washroom? Which car?

549
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:04,453
Well... it's...

550
00:54:04,536 --> 00:54:05,829
Car 13!

551
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:08,123
- Get your ass over here!
- Baby!

552
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,962
Was that my kid? Is she okay?

553
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:16,381
Washroom. Car 13.

554
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,856
Gonna pass through?

555
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:36,860
Let's say you got through and rescued them.

556
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:39,071
How do you get back?

557
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:44,868
In car 15,

558
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:47,871
people are gathered there.

559
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,295
Car 9

560
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:15,023
only four cars away.

561
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:18,152
I'll lead,

562
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:21,029
you in the middle,

563
00:55:22,156 --> 00:55:23,657
and you in the back.

564
00:55:26,577 --> 00:55:28,996
Block anyone attacking from the rear.

565
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,260
I heard you're a fund manager.

566
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:48,056
You're clearly an expert

567
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:51,143
at leaving useless people behind.

568
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:00,068
Wait till we exit the tunnel.

569
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:15,501
Let's go.

570
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:28,991
Come on!

571
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:31,869
Let's go!

572
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:49,636
Move.

573
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,233
Run!

574
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:34,074
Out of the way.

575
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:41,456
They stopped once we entered the tunnel, right?

576
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:43,876
Probably because of darkness.

577
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:46,378
Yeah. I think so too.

578
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:50,799
There's even more here.

579
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:53,427
What do we do now?

580
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:56,388
There's no way around it.

581
00:59:56,763 --> 00:59:57,931
Let's go.

582
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:04,271
- What?
- Give me your phone.

583
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:09,897
Get that out of my face.

584
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:13,901
Yo. Jerk.

585
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:18,030
Felt good seeing your kid, thanks to me?

586
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,241
You grateful or what?

587
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:24,161
Why is your ringtone so tacky?

588
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:27,372
What's wrong with it?

589
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:31,084
How do I change it?

590
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:36,632
Am I funny? You little rat?

591
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,258
How tall are you?

592
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,010
5'9".

593
01:02:40,594 --> 01:02:43,472
6 miles away, at 186mph...

594
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:44,932
What?

595
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:50,938
Two minutes.
The upcoming tunnel gives us two minutes.

596
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:54,066
- Can we do it?
- We gotta.

597
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:58,821
If we miss this one,
there's another in about two miles...

598
01:02:58,904 --> 01:03:03,033
I bet you never got to play with your daughter.

599
01:03:04,827 --> 01:03:06,703
When she gets older,

600
01:03:07,913 --> 01:03:11,083
she'll understand why you worked so hard.

601
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:16,463
Dads get all the shit, and no praise.

602
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:19,883
But it's all about sacrifice, right?

603
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:26,056
What's with the look? Did I sound cool?

604
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:36,316
People rescued. Heading over now.

605
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:39,653
My friend's coming!

606
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:42,072
What did you say?

607
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:45,242
My friend from the other car is coming over.

608
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:47,536
- Who's coming?
- My friend!

609
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:51,415
He was in car 9. He rescued some people.

610
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:52,833
Rescued?

611
01:03:54,418 --> 01:03:59,006
From there to here,
passing through those monsters?

612
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:01,842
Without no injuries?

613
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:04,761
You sure they're not infected?

614
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:08,807
Are you damn sure?!

615
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:11,852
What do you mean?

616
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:14,646
Look, look at them.

617
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:18,275
Right this moment,

618
01:04:18,442 --> 01:04:21,945
no one knows what's happened to their families.

619
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:27,284
We don't even know
if your damn friends are infected!

620
01:04:27,784 --> 01:04:30,037
But we're letting them in here?!

621
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:36,627
I don't believe this.

622
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:47,554
Sir,

623
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:52,267
please say something.

624
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:54,978
They'll be here soon.

625
01:04:56,939 --> 01:04:58,649
Sir!

626
01:08:46,418 --> 01:08:47,836
Get over here!

627
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,055
One!

628
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:01,642
Two!

629
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:09,107
Run!

630
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,331
Jin-hee! Jin-hee!

631
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,585
Hurry the hell up!

632
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:39,721
Open up!

633
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:42,808
Hey! Open this door!

634
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:45,769
Jin-hee!

635
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:47,646
Open this door!

636
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:06,248
Open up!

637
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,677
Open it now!

638
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:20,095
It won't budge!

639
01:10:20,637 --> 01:10:21,722
I can't open it!

640
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:23,223
Smash it!

641
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:24,892
Stand back!

642
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,066
Hurry up!

643
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:37,154
Dammit...

644
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:04,765
You stupid idiots!

645
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:18,779
Come on!

646
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:32,125
In-Gil!

647
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:38,131
Young-guk!

648
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:42,344
Stand back!

649
01:11:42,845 --> 01:11:44,012
Young-guk!

650
01:12:18,839 --> 01:12:20,048
Stay away!

651
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:31,018
Stay back, baby. Please go!

652
01:12:37,232 --> 01:12:39,193
Buddy, hey!

653
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:43,280
Take her and get out.

654
01:12:43,447 --> 01:12:45,282
You have to go!

655
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:48,327
I said go, jerk!

656
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:52,122
I'm getting tired. Please go.

657
01:12:55,792 --> 01:12:59,463
Take care of her, okay?

658
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:04,051
I'll hold them off. Just go!

659
01:13:14,353 --> 01:13:17,272
I'm sorry...

660
01:13:27,074 --> 01:13:29,243
We have to go. Let's go!

661
01:13:31,036 --> 01:13:32,538
Yoon su-yun!

662
01:13:34,581 --> 01:13:36,542
Our baby's name!

663
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:39,002
Got it?

664
01:15:38,997 --> 01:15:40,833
Why did you do it?!

665
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:44,503
You bastard!

666
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:48,006
We could've saved them!

667
01:15:50,092 --> 01:15:51,134
Why?!

668
01:15:52,553 --> 01:15:54,471
He's infected!

669
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:57,057
He's one of them!

670
01:15:57,975 --> 01:15:59,518
This guy's infected!

671
01:15:59,601 --> 01:16:01,603
His eyes! Look at his eyes!

672
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:04,273
He'll become one of them!

673
01:16:04,356 --> 01:16:05,649
You all wanna die?!

674
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:07,776
We've got to throw them out!

675
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:21,415
Those of you who just got here...

676
01:16:22,332 --> 01:16:25,169
I don't think you can stay with us.

677
01:16:26,503 --> 01:16:28,922
Please move to the vestibule.

678
01:16:43,687 --> 01:16:44,897
Just go!

679
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:51,028
Get out!

680
01:16:57,493 --> 01:16:58,785
Get out now!

681
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:01,955
Hurry up!

682
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:04,249
Move!

683
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:07,586
Go!

684
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:09,379
Leave us!

685
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:11,006
Get the hell out!

686
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:14,760
Now!

687
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:17,888
Hurry!

688
01:17:21,391 --> 01:17:24,144
It'll be safer for you here.

689
01:17:24,228 --> 01:17:27,439
But I don't want to stay.

690
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:29,733
It's you and me now.

691
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:30,859
But...

692
01:17:31,109 --> 01:17:32,361
Get the hell out!

693
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:34,988
What are you waiting for!

694
01:17:35,656 --> 01:17:37,032
Okay, let's go.

695
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:42,412
Get out! Rest of you!

696
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:43,914
Get out!

697
01:17:43,956 --> 01:17:46,333
Get out of here!

698
01:18:04,143 --> 01:18:05,310
Let's go.

699
01:18:42,723 --> 01:18:44,099
Tie it faster!

700
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:45,976
More ties! Neckties!

701
01:18:46,018 --> 01:18:49,021
Shut up! I'm working on it!

702
01:19:04,578 --> 01:19:05,996
You idiot.

703
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:08,081
Good riddance.

704
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:13,545
Always helping others before yourself.

705
01:19:17,508 --> 01:19:19,968
Why'd you have to do that?

706
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:23,555
What was the point?

707
01:19:24,848 --> 01:19:26,517
So stupid...

708
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,942
Shut up! Be quiet!

709
01:19:36,068 --> 01:19:37,402
Stay in your seat!

710
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:41,114
What a load of shit.

711
01:19:45,911 --> 01:19:48,330
Finish up. Do the other side too.

712
01:19:58,924 --> 01:20:03,220
Thank you for everything.

713
01:20:04,388 --> 01:20:05,430
That woman...

714
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:07,724
Stop her!

715
01:21:01,111 --> 01:21:03,780
Control, this is busan-bound 101!

716
01:21:03,822 --> 01:21:06,074
Requesting current situation in busan, over.

717
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:08,702
Control?!

718
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:10,412
Control!

719
01:22:36,665 --> 01:22:38,625
It's your birthday...

720
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,256
Don't worry.

721
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:47,134
I'll take you to mom, no matter what.

722
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:53,348
Aren't you scared?

723
01:22:58,937 --> 01:23:00,481
Of course I am.

724
01:23:02,232 --> 01:23:03,817
I'm scared, too.

725
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:10,407
I was so scared.

726
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:14,244
I thought I'd never see you again.

727
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:21,126
I practiced that song just for you.

728
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:27,674
That's why I couldn't sing.

729
01:23:29,885 --> 01:23:31,845
Because I didn't see you.

730
01:23:39,269 --> 01:23:42,064
Will you stay with me?

731
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:59,665
Ex-wife

732
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:15,264
the person you have dialed is unavailable.

733
01:24:24,314 --> 01:24:28,527
Analyst Kim

734
01:24:30,654 --> 01:24:31,864
yes, Kim.

735
01:24:33,448 --> 01:24:35,159
Have you arrived in busan?

736
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,287
Not yet. Where are you? Is it okay there?

737
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:42,416
Busan succeeds in primary defense.

738
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:45,711
What? You sure?

739
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:47,546
Where did you get that info?

740
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:52,759
Sir, this was started at ys biotech.

741
01:24:55,012 --> 01:24:59,183
The centerpiece of our plan!

742
01:25:03,395 --> 01:25:04,771
Sir!

743
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:08,692
This has nothing to do with us... right?

744
01:25:09,526 --> 01:25:11,987
We only did what we were told.

745
01:25:12,362 --> 01:25:16,116
Is this my fault?

746
01:25:19,328 --> 01:25:20,537
It's...

747
01:25:21,497 --> 01:25:23,874
It's not your fault.

748
01:25:26,919 --> 01:25:28,045
Thank you...

749
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:31,548
Kim...

750
01:27:16,487 --> 01:27:18,322
Attention, please.

751
01:27:18,697 --> 01:27:22,659
Due to a track blockage,

752
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:25,078
we have stopped at east daegu station.

753
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:28,957
We will be waiting for the rescue team,

754
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:33,587
or disembarking for another train to busan

755
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:36,965
when this announcement is concluded,

756
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:42,471
I will find a working train
and put it on the far left track.

757
01:27:42,513 --> 01:27:43,263
What's going on?

758
01:27:43,305 --> 01:27:45,849
I repeat, far left track.

759
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:51,188
If you're alive, please transfer safely.

760
01:27:53,148 --> 01:27:54,900
Godspeed.

761
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:02,426
Will there be a rescue?

762
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,222
I heard busan is safe.

763
01:29:09,266 --> 01:29:10,976
We have to move now.

764
01:30:05,906 --> 01:30:07,074
Oh, no.

765
01:30:55,998 --> 01:30:57,166
Coast clear?

766
01:31:00,169 --> 01:31:01,378
Yeah.

767
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:05,507
You go ahead.

768
01:31:29,823 --> 01:31:32,242
Have to find a way across.

769
01:31:55,432 --> 01:31:56,558
What in the...

770
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:10,322
Over here!

771
01:32:47,484 --> 01:32:48,402
No...

772
01:32:48,694 --> 01:32:49,903
Oh, no...

773
01:32:52,072 --> 01:32:53,282
What now?

774
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:57,369
We've gotta move. Come on!

775
01:33:04,501 --> 01:33:06,628
Jin-hee, let's go!

776
01:33:22,519 --> 01:33:23,312
Stand back!

777
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,035
Jin-hee!

778
01:33:52,049 --> 01:33:53,467
Jin-hee!

779
01:34:04,853 --> 01:34:06,396
This can't be...

780
01:34:12,444 --> 01:34:13,779
I'm sorry...

781
01:34:39,513 --> 01:34:46,395
Daddy! Wake up!

782
01:34:47,062 --> 01:34:51,108
Daddy! Daddy!

783
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:08,792
What's going on?

784
01:35:12,421 --> 01:35:15,132
Come on, faster! Faster!

785
01:35:15,299 --> 01:35:16,467
Hurry!

786
01:35:21,847 --> 01:35:23,765
Dammit!

787
01:35:40,157 --> 01:35:41,909
Help...

788
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:26,411
Sweetie, come here!

789
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:32,501
Su-an, su-an!

790
01:36:48,892 --> 01:36:50,519
Mister!

791
01:37:08,453 --> 01:37:09,454
Sweetie!

792
01:37:09,496 --> 01:37:11,915
Su-an, come here!

793
01:37:11,957 --> 01:37:12,791
Mister...

794
01:37:12,875 --> 01:37:15,252
Go! Hurry!

795
01:37:15,586 --> 01:37:16,920
Come on!

796
01:37:17,087 --> 01:37:18,422
Hurry!

797
01:37:40,235 --> 01:37:41,195
Let's go!

798
01:39:04,695 --> 01:39:06,530
Hurry! Hurry!

799
01:39:09,533 --> 01:39:11,118
Daddy!

800
01:41:32,426 --> 01:41:33,635
Mister...

801
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:36,763
I'm scared.

802
01:41:39,766 --> 01:41:41,518
Take me home.

803
01:41:41,685 --> 01:41:46,732
My mom is waiting for me...

804
01:41:50,694 --> 01:41:52,279
My address is...

805
01:41:53,113 --> 01:41:56,992
Suyoung district, busan...

806
01:42:00,245 --> 01:42:02,414
Please help me!

807
01:42:05,709 --> 01:42:07,169
You...

808
01:42:08,212 --> 01:42:09,546
You're infected.

809
01:42:15,594 --> 01:42:16,845
No...

810
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:19,640
No.

811
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:21,558
No!

812
01:42:22,434 --> 01:42:26,605
I can't be! No!

813
01:42:52,965 --> 01:42:54,258
Daddy!

814
01:43:33,714 --> 01:43:35,716
Daddy!

815
01:44:46,328 --> 01:44:48,038
Daddy!

816
01:44:52,835 --> 01:44:54,378
Su-an, come here.

817
01:44:54,545 --> 01:44:56,755
Sit down. Over there.

818
01:44:57,089 --> 01:44:58,215
Sung-kyung.

819
01:44:59,508 --> 01:45:01,385
Listen to me. Pay attention, now.

820
01:45:02,177 --> 01:45:04,429
This must be the brake.

821
01:45:04,847 --> 01:45:09,101
When it's safe, pull this. Got it?

822
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,650
Sweetie.

823
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,946
Look at me, su-an. It's okay.

824
01:45:25,534 --> 01:45:27,161
Look at me, sweetie.

825
01:45:28,328 --> 01:45:30,956
Su-an, listen to me.

826
01:45:32,458 --> 01:45:36,170
Stay with her, no matter what. Okay?

827
01:45:39,256 --> 01:45:41,675
It'll be safe in busan.

828
01:45:41,758 --> 01:45:43,260
Don't go!

829
01:45:44,094 --> 01:45:46,763
Don't go, it's my fault!

830
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:49,725
Daddy, don't go...

831
01:45:49,933 --> 01:45:51,685
Don't go...

832
01:45:52,895 --> 01:45:54,521
Please...

833
01:45:56,523 --> 01:45:58,192
Don't...

834
01:45:59,735 --> 01:46:04,281
Stay with me, please don't go...

835
01:46:06,492 --> 01:46:08,035
Please!

836
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:11,622
Don't go!

837
01:46:13,499 --> 01:46:15,417
Please don't go!

838
01:46:19,963 --> 01:46:22,800
Don't go! No!

839
01:46:25,344 --> 01:46:27,805
Daddy!

840
01:51:33,527 --> 01:51:34,987
Look.

841
01:51:43,662 --> 01:51:45,998
2 bogeys approaching from the tunnel.

842
01:51:46,081 --> 01:51:48,709
Presumably one woman, one child, over.

843
01:51:50,419 --> 01:51:52,880
Check for infection, over.

844
01:51:55,966 --> 01:51:59,011
Where did you just come from?

845
01:52:03,432 --> 01:52:05,601
Unable to verify.

846
01:52:07,769 --> 01:52:09,771
Unable to verify on visual.

847
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:11,815
Please advise, over.

848
01:52:13,692 --> 01:52:15,444
Kill them. Over.

849
01:52:36,298 --> 01:52:41,678
Proudly swept the rain by the cliffs

850
01:52:42,805 --> 01:52:48,852
as it glided through the trees

851
01:52:50,187 --> 01:52:56,401
still following ever the bud,

852
01:52:56,985 --> 01:53:03,575
the 'ahihi lehua of the vale

853
01:53:04,868 --> 01:53:07,162
survivors approaching!

854
01:53:09,623 --> 01:53:13,001
Aloha 'oe

855
01:53:13,085 --> 01:53:19,550
we'll meet again when the flowers bloom

856
01:53:19,758 --> 01:53:23,095
aloha 'oe

857
01:53:23,262 --> 01:53:26,807
aloha 'oe

858
01:53:27,099 --> 01:53:32,563
