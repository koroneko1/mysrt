00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,920
[female judge] The defendant will stand.

00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,920
Trevor Bingley, on all
14 counts of dangerous driving…

-[car horn blares]
-[sports car engine roars]

-[grunts]

[grinding]

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,360
and arson…

-[screaming]
-[flames roar]

10

You have been found guilty.

-[woman gasps]
-[man] Yes!

-[soft murmuring]
-[slow sad music playing]

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,040
[judge] Do you have anything to say
before you're taken down?

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,160
[sincerely] I'm just really, really sorry.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,920
-You see… there was this bee

[exciting theme music playing]

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,440
[female voice] Darling, the car's going
to be here any second.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,400
Darling, did you hear me?

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,680
I can't find my espadrilles. The ones
we got in Aruba with the little, uh,

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,240
the scuba divers on the fronts.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,560
Forget the espadrilles, where's Orlando?

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,080
Orlando isn't coming.
They're sending someone else.

[bell rings]

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,840
What?

Good. Go away.

00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,520
Hello?

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,680
Oh, hello.

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,440
[upbeat] I'm Trevor. From, uh,
from Housesitters Deluxe.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,360
I'm house-sitting for you this week.

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,360
-Oh.

[soft chuckle]

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,680
Good morning, Mrs… Kolstad-Burgenbottom.

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,520
Bergenbatten. Kolstad-Bergenbatten.

43
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,520
Kolstad-Bergenbatten, sorry.

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,440
Thank you.

45
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,720
On behalf of… er, House-sitters Deluxe,

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,080
may I apologize for the last-minute change

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,840
-in personnel and assure you that
-[phone rings]

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,720
all our staff are trained
to the same BSI404 house-sitting…

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,680
[Nina] Christian, the car's here!

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,400
[Trevor forlorn] …industry standards.

-[buzzing]
-[luggage banging down stairs]

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,800
[sighs] I found them,
in a drawer with the flip-flops.

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,520
-Is this him?
-Good morning, Sir. Pleased to meet you--

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,480
Yeah, do you mind if we get on with this?

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,280
We're in a bit of a rush
and I need to be quick.

56
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,400
Okay.

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,680
Everything you need to
know is written in this manual.

58
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,320
-Manual. Right. Good.
-[tentative music]

59
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
[Nina] It's all very straightforward.

60
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,880
Special edition Miele,
infra red beam to open.

61
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,800
[drawer clicks]

62
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,360
Taps are gesture operated.
Left for on. Up for hot. Down for cold.

[dog barks]

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,240
Right for off.
Oh, that's Cupcake. She's very friendly.

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,640
-[Trevor] Oh gracious.
-[licking]

66
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,120
[nervously] Yes,
you are friendly, aren't you?

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,600
[Nina] Sliding doors.
Keys are in this drawer.

68
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,480
-[Trevor patiently] Okay.
-And all the blinds are remote controlled.

69
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,200
Oh, right, I'll… sorry, just a moment,
[Nina] And here--

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,120
-[phone rings]
-[Trevor whispers] Down!

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,640
-[Nina] Yes, hello?
-[Christian] Er…

72
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,240
You'll find all the remotes here.
You need me to explain them?

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,120
[hesitantly] Um…

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,160
Uh, no, that's fine.

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,160
-[Nina] Okay, bye.
-The dog has a severe nut allergy.

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,840
[firmly] She mustn't eat anything
that isn't her prescription dog food.

77
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,880
Or there is, uh,
doggie doo-doo everywhere.

78
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
[Nina] We keep the dog food in here.

79
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,200
-[Cupcake barks]
-Oh.

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
[door clicks]

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,160
-So please keep the door closed.
-Door closed. Right.

82
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,280
And the chip in her collar
operates the dog flap in there.

83
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,520
Ah yes.

84
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,840
Because if she can't get out…

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,080
There's doggie doo-doo everywhere.
It's a recurring theme, yeah. Hey!

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,200
-[Cupcake barks]
-Who doo-doos everywhere, eh?

87
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,200
Cupcake, come say bye to Mummy! Yeah?
Good girl, good girl. Christian, bags!

88
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,920
-Yeah, going now.
-[metallic clanging]

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,360
-Woah! Careful!.
-Oh.

90
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,560
Oh, I'm so sorry.

91
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,840
I paid £80,000 for that.

92
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
It turned out to be a Kandinsky.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,480
It's worth a lot of money.
But not as much as this.

94
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,200
[magical music playing]

95
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,760
-[Trevor] Golly.
-[Christian chuckles]

96
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,960
You know what it is?

97
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,800
It's… an E-type Jaguar, isn't it?

98
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
The first E-type Jaguar ever made.

99
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,960
-Huh! Amazing.
-What do you think she's worth?

100
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,160
Oh, must be… thousands.

101
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,160
Two million pounds.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
O… kay.

103
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,720
-Hello?
-Yeah, okay.

104
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,760
All the locks and the alarm
are operated by two simple codes.

105
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,840
I used the names of
famous naval battles to make it easy.

106
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,360
Uh, so to open, uh,
it's the Battle of Frisverhelwilen.

107

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,520
-Yup. So, okay, there we go.
-Okay.

110
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,720
[door opens]

111
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,360
Okay.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,480
And to arm the system, even easier,
uh, it's the Battle of Bulhornbører.

113
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,440
-[soft muttering]
-[Nina] 1513.

114
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,480
Oh… right, yes.
I think perhaps I should uh--

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,800
Oh no, don't worry.
It's all in the manual.

116
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,600
Oh, the manual. Yes, of course.

117
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,920
Yeah, if the panel locks down
for any reason,

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320
Nina did have them add a voice override.

119
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
Yes, but that only works with my voice,

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,560
[impatiently] and he won't need it
anyway because it's all in the manual.

121
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,240
Right, yes. Okay.

122
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,040
The library is strictly
out of bounds to the dog.

123
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,520
There's an illuminated manuscript
in there that's worth millions.

124
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,440
[Trevor] Okay.

125
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,960
It's a no-go zone for
Cupcake, as is our bedroom upstairs.

126
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,080
Uh, you are in the maid's room,
far side down the corridor.

127
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,920
-Okay.
-Uh… any questions?

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
-Uhm--
-Good.

[luggage clattering]

130
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,800
You have done this
work before, haven't you?

131
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
Uh, no, actually. I'm new to the company.

[laughs]

133
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,640
You've never done house-sitting before?

134
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,160
No… not as such.

135
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,800
But please don't worry,
I have a house too.

136
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,760
Well, I used to have a house.
So all this is very familiar territory.

137
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,440
[Nina] Hm.

138
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,960
Oh here, let me… I'll get that for you.

-If you wouldn't mind doing the same.
-Absolutely. My pleasure.

the house with them for over eight hours?
