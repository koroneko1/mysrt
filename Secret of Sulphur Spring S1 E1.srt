00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:06,086
(dramatic music playing)

2
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,649
(panting)

3
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:24,569
(music continues)

4
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:34,912
(thunder cracking)

5
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:40,084
(sinister music playing)

6
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:00,372
You really think
this place is haunted?

7
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:02,384
Only one way
to find out.

8
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:04,477
Unless you're
too scared.

9
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:07,485
Uh, I'm not.

10
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:10,452
Boy:
Go ahead, Topher.

11
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:12,986
Come on.
Look inside.

12
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:15,530
I dare you.

13
00:01:16,932 --> 00:01:18,058
(exhales)

14
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,112

00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:30,957
(music continues)

16
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:43,026
(girl screams)

17
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,546
Aaaaah!

18
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,950
Wyatt!

19
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:51,168
I got you so good.

20
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:52,964
Are you streaming this?

21
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:54,796
(Griffin laughing)

22
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,148
Give it to me.

23
00:01:57,675 --> 00:01:58,676
Whoa!

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,774
Slow down.
Is that my phone?

25
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,053
Why were
you screaming?

26
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:03,329
Ask him.

27
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:04,890
What'd you do?

28
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:07,285
I barely touched her foot
and she freaked.

29
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:08,508
It was awesome.

30
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:11,229
- You're such a child.
- What's that make you?

31
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:14,000
Two minutes older
and light years more mature.

32
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:15,683
(thunder cracking)

33
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,993
Why don't we go upstairs and
finish unpacking your rooms?

34
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:21,485
(screams repeating)

35
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,046
This is hilarious.

36
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:26,102
(video rewinding)

37
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:28,871
(Zoey's screams
interspersed with music)

38
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,210
You paid Wyatt five bucks
to scare Zoey?

39
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,965
It was worth the money.
Come look at this.

40
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:38,025
You keep tormenting
your sister,

41
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,318
I'll be holding on
to all your allowance.

42
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:44,477
(sighs) It's not like
there's anything else to do.

43
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:54,767
You know, when I was your age,

44
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:56,787
I practically lived
in the woods out back.

45
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:58,861
We'd explore,

46
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,504
play games,

47
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:02,948
breathe fresh air.

48
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,950
I couldn't wait
to stay here every summer.

49
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,452
At least one of us
had a happy childhood.

50
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:07,887
Griff.

51
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:10,973
It's only been a few days.

52
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:12,350
Give it a chance?

53
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:15,019
Sulphur Springs
may surprise you.

54
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,777
(thunder cracking)

55
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:26,155

56
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:41,212

62
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,646
Gonna be late
on your first day.

63
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,940
Could just skip it
all together.

64
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:45,259
For a marathon guitar session?

65
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:46,719
Hmm, I don't think so.

66
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:48,762
This is how
all the greats start,

67
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:51,073
in their room,
perfecting their act.

68
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,826
Seriously.

69
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:55,619
I read it in a book.

70
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:58,372
Okay, well, a school book
would be nice.

71
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:02,334
See, those are the kind of books
I'd be reading at Ballard,

72
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:05,171
but Dad killed that dream.

73
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:08,758
There are
other music programs,

74
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,718
and we'll find one
just as good.

75
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,553
Around here?

76
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:15,466
I doubt it.
This place sucks.

77
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:16,581
Language!

78
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,417
Fine! Stinks.
Happy?

79
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:20,461
(scoffs)
How can I be happy

80
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:22,438
when you're determined
to be miserable?

81
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:26,192
Don't you miss Chicago?

82
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:29,219
Of course.
I'd move back in a second.

83
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:30,804
Great. Let's go.

84
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:32,448
Won't take me long to repack.

85
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:34,533
It's not that simple.

86
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,956
And, hey, this place
isn't completely awful.

87
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,958
If we hadn't moved here,

88
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,503
I never would've found this.

89
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:49,882
A picture
of some random kid?

90
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:51,133
Turn it over.

91
00:05:56,164 --> 00:05:57,998
- That's Dad?
- (Griffin's mother chuckles)

92
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:00,184
Can't you tell
by the goofy grin?

93
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:03,479
It's been a long time
since I've seen him smile.

94
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:06,023
Could say the same
about you.

95
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,611
I'm hoping that'll change
when you make some friends.

96
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:15,157
You nervous?

97
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,035
Never been
the new kid before.

98
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,122
(sighs)
Just be yourself.

99
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,874
That kid's pretty great.

100
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,089
(upbeat music playing)

101
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:43,811
(sighs)

102
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:59,868
(music continues)

103
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,122
Works every time.

104
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,626
I would like to welcome
a new student.

105
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:15,955
Griffin, why don't you
stand up and tell us

106
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,183
a little something
about yourself?

107
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:24,585
Um, hi. My name
is Griffin Campbell,

108
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:26,795
and my family just
moved here from Chicago.

109
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,147
Any hobbies?

110
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:29,982
Sports? Video games?

111
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:33,135
I'm mostly into music.

112
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,012
Classic rock. Blues.

113
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:36,221
- Lame.
- (students laugh)

114
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:37,931
What was that, Quinn?

115
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:41,577
She‐‐ She was wondering why
Griffin <i>came</i> to Sulphur Springs.

116
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:44,688
Well, my dad quit his job,

117
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,874
and bought an old hotel.

118
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,585
Now I'm stuck here while
my parents fix up The Tremont.

119
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:53,172
(all whispering indistinctly)

120
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:57,551
You moved into The Tremont?

121
00:07:58,369 --> 00:07:59,536
Have you seen Savannah?

122
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,246
I heard if you look her
in the eye,

123
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,748
you'll never be seen again.

124
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:05,500
That's just a silly rumor.
Ghosts aren't real.

125
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:08,729
Yes, they are. We saw a
ghost in The Tremont last night.

126
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:11,048
I saw a ghost.

127
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:12,758
Quinn:
She let out this crazy scream.

128
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:15,427
It's true. The Tremont
is definitely haunted.

129
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,780
Class. That's enough.

130
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:22,076
(school bell ringing)

131
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:33,087
Girl:
Want to sit down?

132
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,882
It's not complicated.
There's room.

133
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,292
People see those drawings,

134
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,169
they're gonna figure it out.

135
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:50,295
Figure what out?

136
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:52,064
Your secret identity.

137
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:54,852
Locker ninja.

138
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:56,290
I caught a glimpse
of your shoes

139
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:58,095
when you were
kicking past my head.

140
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,697
The art's the same.

141
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:02,391
Shoe design
could be my side hustle.

142
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,201
Doesn't mean
I'm a superhero.

143
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:07,037
I'm good with faces.

144
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:09,398
Still don't know
your name, though.

145
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,000
- Harper.
- I'm Griffin.

146
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,402
Thanks for
the assist earlier.

147
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,005
Thank the janitor.
He showed me that move.

148
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:18,865
Said it was the best‐kept
secret in Sulphur Springs.

149
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:22,344
(sarcastically): Wow! Just when
I thought this place was boring.

150
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,976
Uh, why is everyone staring?

151
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,753
Do you have a not‐so‐secret
identity I should know about?

152
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,838
(chuckles)

153
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:35,674
Some kids thought they saw
a ghost at The Tremont.

154
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:37,467
People found out
that I live there‐‐

155
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:39,153
(loudly):
You live at The Tremont?

156
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:43,682
(sighs)
Okay.

157
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:45,267
I haven't seen Savannah.

158
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,019
I don't even know
who she is

159
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:48,746
or‐or was.

160
00:09:49,563 --> 00:09:51,732
- This is Savannah Dillon.
- Griffin: Okay.

161
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:54,151
She disappeared
from The Tremont 30 years ago.

162
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:55,461
Never to be seen again.

163
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:57,070
Alive anyway.

164
00:09:57,154 --> 00:09:58,905
Spoiler alert.

165
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:01,700
The girl those kids
saw last night wasn't a ghost.

166
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:03,660
It was my sister.

167
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:06,064
Plenty of other people have
seen Savannah around the hotel.

168
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:08,515
It's only a matter of time
before you do too.

169
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,726
Ooo‐ooo.

170
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:13,145
Can't say I didn't warn you.

171
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:26,700
(footsteps running)

172
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,789
(grunting)

173
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:34,374
(groaning)

174
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:45,969
Savannah?

175
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,601
So, you do believe in ghosts.

176
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:55,312
Uh... Oh.

177
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:57,130
I‐‐ I was just messing
with you.

178
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:59,216
You need help up? Looks
like you fell pretty hard.

179
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,176
- I'm fine.
- If you say so.

180
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,361
See you at school.

181
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,971
- Where are you going?
- Shortcut.

182
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:07,032
I live on the other side
of the woods.

183
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,810
You're not worried about
getting grabbed by a ghost?

184
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:11,395
Are you kidding?

185
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:14,123
How cool would it be
to actually run into Savannah?

186
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:16,792
But she's only been seen
inside the hotel.

187
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:19,336
And you never even
tried getting in?

188
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:23,173
Once. I cut my knee pretty bad
crawling through a window.

189
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:25,300
My mom's still ticked
about it.

190
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,412
If you want,
I could give you a tour.

191
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:29,955
We'll have a séance!

192
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,873
- A séance?
- Uh‐huh.

193
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,334
We'll need lots of candles.
Pink. Way more inviting.

194
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:35,836
And salt, incense, rocks...

195
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,921
Well, technically,
smooth stones,

196
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:40,399
but I'll work
with what I can get.

197
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,151
(sarcastically):
Is that all?

198
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:44,278
Well, an open mind
would help.

199
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:57,833
So... this is where some
of your best memories were made?

200
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,277
The bunkhouse actually.

201
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:01,820
Campers weren't allowed
in the hotel

202
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:03,422
unless parents
were visiting.

203
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:05,615
Didn't want us bothering
the fancy clientèle.

204
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:08,510
Fancy? This place?

205
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:10,620
The Tremont used to be
a world‐class resort.

206
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:12,873
People would come from all over
to soak in the hot springs.

207
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,499
You could hardly
get a reservation.

208
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,835
If the hotel was so great,

209
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,312
how come it closed?

210
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,214
Well, the springs
started to dry up,

211
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:22,466
along with business.

212
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,943
That's not what I heard.

213
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:29,473
The rumor is...
people stopped coming

214
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:32,201
because The Tremont
is haunted.

215
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:35,174
What did I tell you about
scaring your brother and sister?

216
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:36,897
I'm not scared.

217
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:38,523
You were last night.

218
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:41,001
Can we please not argue
in front of company?

219
00:12:41,735 --> 00:12:43,432
I'm Sarah Campbell,
Griffin's mom.

220
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:44,570
I'm Harper.

221
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:46,089
Griffin:
She's a friend from school.

222
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:48,713
You're really gonna
reopen the hotel?

223
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:51,285
Well, it doesn't look like much
now, but with some hard work,

224
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,079
The Tremont
could be amazing again.

225
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,248
You shouldn't have
a problem filling rooms,

226
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:56,708
even like this.

227
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,232
People want
to see Savannah up close.

228
00:12:58,627 --> 00:12:59,878
I know I do.

229
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:01,296
Who's Savannah?

230
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,215
The ghost of a kid

231
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,175
who's supposedly been
haunting the hotel

232
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,552
for 30 years.

233
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:08,820
Griffin!

234
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,514
I said supposedly.

235
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:12,182
And where did you hear this?

236
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:15,227
There's a ton of stuff online
about Savannah's disappearance,

237
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:17,562
articles, sightings.

238
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:19,689
Especially with
the anniversary coming up.

239
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:21,233
Here, I'll show you guys.

240
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,542
I think we get the idea.

241
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:25,487
Where has Savannah
been spotted?

242
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,047
Mainly on the top floor.

243
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:29,157
Our rooms
are up there.

244
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,051
The hotel is not haunted.

245
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:34,371
(lights crackling)

246
00:13:34,455 --> 00:13:35,931
Zoey:
It's Savannah!

247
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:42,104
(tense music playing)

248
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,240
(music continues)

249
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,292
(music continues)

250
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,916
Ben:
It's rusted shut.

251
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,560
Shine the light over here.

252
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,278
(Ben grunts)

253
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,476
Not funny. Turn it back on.

254
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,328
That wasn't me.
I swear.

255
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,272
The battery must have died.

256
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:43,957
Use the app on your phone.

257
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:51,798
What if the hotel
really is haunted?

258
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:55,427
You're a smart kid.

259
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:57,412
Too smart
to believe in ghosts.

260
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,848
Everyone at school is curious.

261
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,584
What do you think
happened to Savannah?

262
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,377
- Drop it, Griffin.
- I just don't get it.

263
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:06,755
How does a kid
vanish without a trace?

264
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,148
Uh, I mean...

265
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,509
What if something happens
to one of us?

266
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:12,927
I said drop it!

267
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,113
Whatever happened to that girl
happened years ago.

268
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:22,454
Look...

269
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,400
I don't want to hear
another word about Savannah.

270
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:27,317
Okay?

271
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:28,835
Especially in front
of the twins.

272
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,799
(creaking)

273
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:40,680
Can you show us
that website?

274
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:43,124
I don't think your mom
wants you guys‐‐

275
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,061
Please. We really don't want
to run into Savannah.

276
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:48,396
Okay.

277
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:53,551
What is this?

278
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:55,011
Griffin:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

279
00:15:55,095 --> 00:15:57,013
<i>please put your hands together
and welcome</i>

280
00:15:57,097 --> 00:16:00,600
<i>the one, the only,
guitar god Griffin Campbell.</i>

281
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:03,370
<i>"Woo. Yeah!
I love you, Griffin."</i>

282
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,624
(rock music playing)

283
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:11,503
(all laughing)

284
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:15,966
Here comes
the Guitar God now.

285
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:17,534
- (music stops)
- Harper: So...

286
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:19,452
you do have
a secret identity.

287
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:21,413
What are you guys
doing with my laptop?

288
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:22,872
You did this to yourself.

289
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:25,433
I wasn't even trying
to pay you back.

290
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,044
I bet if you upload the video,
you'd go viral.

291
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:29,604
In a good way.

292
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:33,550
How does pizza sound
for dinner?

293
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:35,135
Harper, you're welcome to stay.

294
00:16:35,219 --> 00:16:36,928
She should probably check
with her parents.

295
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:38,113
I'll text my mom.

296
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:42,993
(imitating air guitar)

297
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:46,163
We should finish the tour.

298
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:52,568
Harper: We could've
skipped the basement.

299
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:54,588
I saw something
down here earlier.

300
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,616
(gasps)
The Tremont has a bunker?

301
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,968
Let's check it out.

302
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,620
Oh, hey, here, take this.

303
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:05,015
Oh, it won't help.
The battery is dead.

304
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,392
It works fine.

305
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:35,361
(cranking handle)

306
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:38,131
(door creaks open)

307
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:49,017
(lights switching on)

308
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,064
(lights continue switching on)

309
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:02,030
(suspenseful music playing)

310
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:18,380
(music continues)

311
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,884
(crashing)

312
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:41,094
Jeez!

313
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:42,612
(both chuckle nervously)

314
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:46,950
(Harper exclaiming softly)

315
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:54,291
So worth it.

316
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,841
(imitating Darth Vader):
"I am your father."

317
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,986
(suspenseful music playing)

318
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:36,666
What's wrong?

319
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,741
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

320
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,968
We have to find out
where this goes.

321
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:31,137
How do we open it?

322
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:33,431
It's gotta be this.

323
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,479
(creaks)

324
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,569
Wait. Hold on.
I need to hook this.

325
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,033
- (Harper screams)
- Griffin: Harper!

326
00:20:57,314 --> 00:20:58,540
(grunts)

327
00:21:01,568 --> 00:21:02,711
Harper.

328
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:07,448
Hey.

329
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,217
You okay?
What happened?

330
00:21:10,494 --> 00:21:12,095
You didn't feel that jolt?

331
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,181
It was like...

332
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,475
electricity or something.

333
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,104
(exhales)
I‐‐ I don't like this.

334
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:22,630
We should go back.

335
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,524
(footsteps receding)

336
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:27,068
Oh, my gosh! Look!

337
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,031
It's Savannah!

338
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:34,033
She's real.

339
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:35,410
I knew it.

340
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:37,203
It‐‐ It can't be.

341
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:39,022
I'm telling you...

342
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:40,290
it's her.

343
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,904
I've talked
to three electricians.

344
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:48,448
No one
will take the job.

345
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:49,657
Well, probably just as well.

346
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,760
Can't afford
to hire them anyway.

347
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:54,179
The money fight again?

348
00:21:55,622 --> 00:21:57,265
It didn't have
to be a fight, Ben.

349
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,976
All you had to do
was talk to me.

350
00:22:00,877 --> 00:22:03,629
Instead, you cashed out
our savings,

351
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,940
bought this place,
and uprooted our lives.

352
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,985
And no one knows why.

353
00:22:10,637 --> 00:22:12,113
I can't explain it.

354
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:17,744
All I know is that
I had to come back here.

355
00:22:25,068 --> 00:22:27,086
Uh, I thought
the springs dried up.

356
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:29,964
They did.

357
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,367
This is crazy.

358
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,677
(suspenseful music playing)

359
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:41,684
(breathing heavily)

360
00:22:43,086 --> 00:22:45,230
(music continues)

361
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:54,948
(music continues)

362
00:23:00,103 --> 00:23:02,080
- Boy 1: She's over there.
- Boy 2: Get her.

363
00:23:07,694 --> 00:23:09,112
Savannah:
Woo!

364
00:23:09,196 --> 00:23:10,588
(playful chatter)

365
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:12,200
(whistle being blown)

366
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:13,366
Woman:
All right, that's it.

367
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,009
Back to the bunkhouse.
Let's go.

368
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,012
Can you take her to get
that knee checked out?

369
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:19,848
Yeah, get some ice.

370
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:21,599
Come on, guys.

371
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:25,503
Just some kids
playing a game.

372
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:26,754
- Maybe.
- It's weird though.

373
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,773
She looks
exactly like Savannah.

374
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:30,258
It can't be though.

375
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,343
Ghosts
don't get bruises.

376
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:36,013
But that doesn't explain water
magically appearing in the springs...

377
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:37,991
or the flashlight
working again.

378
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,243
It‐‐ It's like...

379
00:23:40,894 --> 00:23:42,078
Griffin.

380
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,538
Look.

381
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:46,749
(suspenseful music playing)

382
00:23:58,245 --> 00:24:00,889
(music continues)

383
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:12,066
It's like
we stepped back in time.

384
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:14,694
Bennett, pay attention.

385
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,905
Sorry.

386
00:24:25,188 --> 00:24:27,332
(music continues)

387
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:36,633
Dad?

388
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:43,164
<i>Next time on</i>
Secrets of Sulphur Springs...

389
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,684
We can't leave now!

390
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:46,012
<i>The hotel is open
for business,</i>

391
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:47,271
<i>Savannah hasn't gone missing,</i>

392
00:24:47,356 --> 00:24:48,419
<i>your dad is our age!</i>

393
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:50,671
Time travel is
the only explanation.

394
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,132
Zoey: <i>What if we really did
disturb a spirit or something</i>

395
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:54,342
<i>when we moved in?</i>

396
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,177
Uh, I'm looking
for my daughter.

397
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,428
You must be Harper's mom.

398
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:58,888
We have to get out of here!

399
00:24:58,972 --> 00:25:00,425
Savannah's upstairs!

400
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,337
- Sarah: Griffin!
- He's not up there!

401
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:03,678
It's like they both
disappeared.

402
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:05,614
Are we stuck in the past?
