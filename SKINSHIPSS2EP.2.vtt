00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:31.594
Nope

00:01:31.594 --> 00:01:33.629

00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:57.371

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:07.178
I'm sorry but...

00:03:07.178 --> 00:03:10.720

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.284

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:42.986
I’d like to play special song for the special couple 

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:44.361

00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:48.463
Hope my song will bright up the day 

00:03:48.463 --> 00:03:52.227
and all the best for you two

00:03:53.183 --> 00:03:55.800

00:04:17.394 --> 00:04:19.113

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:21.156

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.864
Minie told me that you want to join this dating event ?

00:05:05.628 --> 00:05:10.470
May I ask why? 

00:05:13.264 --> 00:05:16.123
When I first saw your post about dating

00:05:16.123 --> 00:05:19.630
I want to get to know you as well

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.534
I’ve been a member of this group for a while

00:05:22.534 --> 00:05:26.872
and I think I’m ready to open up to someone

00:05:31.393 --> 00:05:35.003
It’s very funny when I first saw your post

00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:38.694
Is it photoshopped ?

00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:48.320
Hang on !
I'll show you now

00:05:50.562 --> 00:05:53.238
This one

00:05:56.473 --> 00:06:00.440
LOL

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:08.642
Oh well...I don’t think you like it 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.981
LOL

00:06:10.981 --> 00:06:15.145
Well…I like weird thing and may be crazier than you can imagine

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:16.907
Anyway, It looks good

00:06:21.575 --> 00:06:23.320
Excuse me...

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.320
Does my lipstick strain the teeth?

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.783
Oh a bit !

00:06:26.783 --> 00:06:28.816
a bit ? 

00:06:32.285 --> 00:06:33.466
It's fine now

00:06:33.466 --> 00:06:35.466
Oh ok

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.763
Cheers !

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.646
James…Can you smell that?

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.375
Rice is burn !!!

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:48.000
What !!

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Rice is burn !!!

00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:55.660
But you said it's all done ???

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.741
Yes true ! 

00:06:56.741 --> 00:07:00.175
Main dishes are done except for this....

00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:03.449
Let me see

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:06.392
Ohh...all of that?

00:07:09.112 --> 00:07:12.074
What are we gonna do then?

00:07:12.074 --> 00:07:14.074
Cheers !

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.837
Win...Do you like this style?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.851
Serve them with spaghetti first

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.116
spaghetti?

00:08:06.116 --> 00:08:07.124
Hmm..right

00:08:07.124 --> 00:08:10.702
and I’ll order online food for the rest of it

00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:13.327
Why don’t you just order everything online?

00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:15.048
James !!!

00:08:15.048 --> 00:08:15.835
Hmmmmm

00:08:15.835 --> 00:08:16.850
What !!

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.710
Damn...

00:08:21.732 --> 00:08:23.200
Guy!!

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.899
Win is in trouble

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:28.214
What !!!!!

00:08:28.214 --> 00:08:29.749
What happened?

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:32.430
I don’t know . I just show this picture

00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:38.316
Oh my god!!!!!!
What happened

00:08:39.088 --> 00:08:42.709
Well…After looking at this picture, Win drinks it all.

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:44.709
I think he’s a bit excited

00:08:44.709 --> 00:08:45.973
Win !!

00:08:45.973 --> 00:08:47.973
Minie!!!
You’re responsible for this

00:08:47.973 --> 00:08:49.310
It’s not our fault !!

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.132
(crying)

00:08:55.779 --> 00:08:59.275
so take him home !!

00:08:59.275 --> 00:09:01.275
Win..

00:09:04.988 --> 00:09:08.640
You always make trouble Win..

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.986
Your hand now !

00:09:13.993 --> 00:09:15.302
It's Minie....

00:09:15.302 --> 00:09:19.838
Oh well...it's me who have to do all of this

00:09:22.558 --> 00:09:26.024
Do you have to take care of your friend that much?

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:31.075
Don’t tell me…you are jealous?

00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:33.151
Jealous ??

00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:35.260
Nopeee, I just want to know

00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:40.925
Anyway I’ll have to look after my boss’s son next week

00:09:40.925 --> 00:09:42.168
Your boss's son?

00:09:42.168 --> 00:09:44.719
What do you do?

00:09:44.719 --> 00:09:48.295
My boss and his wife have to 
attend the meeting in another province for a day

00:09:48.295 --> 00:09:51.271
so they ask me to look after their son

00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:53.506
Why it’s to be you?

00:09:56.006 --> 00:09:58.864
They trust me I guess

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:05.808
However, I got 5 free health check-up packages for helping them

00:10:05.808 --> 00:10:08.634
I think it’s worth it

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.029
But it’s holiday! 

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:15.200
Why do you have to work?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.864
Now we’re living together 

00:10:17.864 --> 00:10:19.614
Don't you want to spend more time with me?

00:10:19.614 --> 00:10:22.684
You want us to live here

00:10:22.684 --> 00:10:24.588
because you want to stay close to James right?

00:10:24.588 --> 00:10:27.410
Well of course! 
I want to stay close to my boyfriend

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.735
You don’t get it

00:10:28.735 --> 00:10:30.000
You’re not in relationship !

00:10:31.434 --> 00:10:33.103
Well…just go James

00:10:33.103 --> 00:10:37.455
I’ll take care of your boyfriend. Don’t worry !

00:10:37.455 --> 00:10:39.267
Nope Win 

00:10:39.267 --> 00:10:40.809
You only need to take care of yourself

00:10:40.809 --> 00:10:42.903
You're always quiet. Only stay alone in your place.

00:10:42.903 --> 00:10:44.057
I don’t know if you’re going to suicide……

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.297
Well…just stop

00:10:46.297 --> 00:10:48.297
You both

00:10:48.297 --> 00:10:51.800
Win...He’s my boyfriend
I’ll take care of him 

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.800
and I’ll take Teenoi with me

00:10:54.792 --> 00:10:57.500
So you stay here with Minie

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.882
No way

00:10:58.882 --> 00:11:03.553
I’d rather stay alone than be with Minie
How scary…

00:11:03.553 --> 00:11:10.560
Hmm…I’m selective enough

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.931
Look at you now….you’re not my type

00:11:14.931 --> 00:11:17.306
or….you wany Montra to look after you?

00:11:17.306 --> 00:11:18.997
Nope
I'm alright

00:11:18.997 --> 00:11:22.126
I don’t think she’s my type

00:11:22.126 --> 00:11:24.585
or you like older woman than Montra?

00:11:24.585 --> 00:11:27.529
I think Minie can help

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:29.706
Enough! 

00:11:29.706 --> 00:11:30.831
Stop encouraging…

00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:34.348
What?
Why don’t you just open up to someone?

00:11:34.348 --> 00:11:36.553
someone to brighten up your life?

00:11:36.553 --> 00:11:40.160
Anyway, how’s Beam?

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.764
I think she’s cute

00:11:44.764 --> 00:11:46.764
True!!

00:11:46.764 --> 00:11:48.115
I think she’s cute

00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:50.308
Her name starts with "B" and 

00:11:50.308 --> 00:11:54.273
short hair like Beauty, you think?

00:11:54.273 --> 00:11:57.716
Damn…How dare you?

00:11:57.716 --> 00:12:01.174
No one’s gonna blame you if you’re sitting quietly 

00:12:01.174 --> 00:12:02.560
Come on !

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.560
If you’re ok with her, just keep going!

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.534
Nothing to lose

00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.894
I’ve to go to work now

00:12:10.894 --> 00:12:12.640
I don’t want to be late. Tae’s gonna yell at me

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.971
Wait….I’ll go with you

00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:17.622
Are you leaving now?

00:12:17.622 --> 00:12:23.360
Yes Baby!
I’ve seminar about the new department

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.963
I have to go now

00:12:24.963 --> 00:12:25.998
One minute !!!

00:12:25.998 --> 00:12:31.021
I’m leaving now. See you then

00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:32.809
Can I stay ?

00:12:32.809 --> 00:12:34.923
Gosh!!!!!!!

00:12:34.923 --> 00:12:37.415
Minie 
eat what you left

00:12:37.415 --> 00:12:38.129
What?

00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:40.129
Your boyfriend just drop it 

00:12:49.503 --> 00:12:56.640
I know what you’re thinking about

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.640
What do you mean ?

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.396
I don’t have any plans 

00:13:00.837 --> 00:13:01.961
I’m just saying

00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:04.412
Why do you have to worry that much?

00:13:04.412 --> 00:13:07.631
What are you talking about?

00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:10.256
You keep talking the same shit…I don’t get it

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:11.476
Oh really ??

00:13:12.321 --> 00:13:18.774
You want Win and James to be here 

00:13:18.774 --> 00:13:21.280
But you didn’t care much about Win !!

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.547
You only want to stay close to James 

00:13:26.062 --> 00:13:27.663
Right !!

00:13:29.796 --> 00:13:33.283
So tell me who did it of this ?

00:13:33.283 --> 00:13:36.960
I’ve heard what you’ve discussed with the fortune teller lately.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.645
You secretly use Win’s birthday 

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.760
to see if you and Win could be a right couple

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.628
Right !!!

00:13:42.628 --> 00:13:45.105
No way....

00:13:50.802 --> 00:13:53.128
Is she ok?

00:13:58.458 --> 00:14:00.458
The mother god is here with us

00:14:00.458 --> 00:14:01.963
Fortune teller ! 

00:14:01.963 --> 00:14:04.746
Can you tell me if we could be a perfect couple

00:14:04.746 --> 00:14:06.746
based on our fate?

00:14:06.746 --> 00:14:08.664
Darling

00:14:08.664 --> 00:14:12.970
Give me the birthday of you both

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.733
I was born on December 22, 1993

00:14:16.733 --> 00:14:19.341
how about him?

00:14:21.363 --> 00:14:24.981
He’s born on May 14, 1991 

00:14:29.686 --> 00:14:32.480
You both are fire

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.546
If you stay together, you both could be in trouble

00:14:35.546 --> 00:14:36.864
Fire and trouble  

00:14:36.864 --> 00:14:39.432
Oh my godddddddd

00:14:39.432 --> 00:14:42.125
Anyway what to do then?

00:14:42.125 --> 00:14:44.625
You mean to change your fate

00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:46.294
or to get naked...

00:14:46.294 --> 00:14:47.596
to get naked !

00:14:47.596 --> 00:14:51.550
Hmm......careful girl !

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.550
I'm kidding
I mean change the fate

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.783
You have to stop fire with water

00:14:57.783 --> 00:15:00.000
Fire will be calm with water

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.832
Water will be calm with fire

00:15:01.832 --> 00:15:03.766
Sorry ?

00:15:03.766 --> 00:15:06.553
Anyway I don’t recommend this relationship

00:15:06.553 --> 00:15:08.430
You both can’t get along 

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.430
so stop it now !

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:14.962
Well...when is my time to be in relationship?

00:15:14.962 --> 00:15:19.475
I’m so bored to be single

00:15:19.475 --> 00:15:20.960
The one you’re dating right now 

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.915
will be right for you soon.

00:15:24.283 --> 00:15:26.560
You only have to wait for the right time

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.560
What’s time?

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.760
What? I mean the right time

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.328
so who then?

00:15:36.328 --> 00:15:39.176
I've been dating with more than 30 guys

00:15:39.176 --> 00:15:42.456
You have to stop now

00:15:42.456 --> 00:15:43.543
Help me please

00:15:43.543 --> 00:15:46.016
I want to have someone 

00:15:46.016 --> 00:15:48.734
please....

00:15:48.734 --> 00:15:50.820
Wait….why are you so hurry?

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.013
I still have some questions

00:15:52.013 --> 00:15:54.386
I can pay you more !!

00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:55.973
Do you accept "Thai Chana" payment?

00:15:55.973 --> 00:15:57.859
What? Thai Chana ?

00:15:57.859 --> 00:15:58.599
Nope...

00:15:58.599 --> 00:15:59.596
Help me please...

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:02.123
I just want to have someone !

00:16:02.123 --> 00:16:03.729
Just wait and see

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:06.994
You'll know when it’s time

00:16:06.994 --> 00:16:08.969
I gotta go

00:16:11.432 --> 00:16:12.800
Fortune teller !!!

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.101
Well…it’s just that

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:21.120
Hmm...I’m alone and Win also has no one

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.696
I think there’s nothing to worry 

00:16:23.696 --> 00:16:28.640
But it’s your best friend’s ex?...Minie

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.426
I’ve already talked to Beauty

00:16:30.426 --> 00:16:32.051
She’s fine 

00:16:32.051 --> 00:16:37.436
and she’s now dating with her new farang boy

00:16:37.436 --> 00:16:39.096
(sigh)

00:16:39.096 --> 00:16:42.240
I don’t get what you’re doing.You both

00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:46.720
You don’t have to worry about me

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.484
If I really want to be Win’s girlfriend, 
I won’t set up dating event for him

00:16:50.484 --> 00:16:54.720
and one thing...I believe in fate

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.915
but If you want me to keep it secret

00:17:01.915 --> 00:17:07.187
you’ve to help me separate Win from James

00:17:07.187 --> 00:17:10.443
I want to spend more time with James

00:17:10.443 --> 00:17:12.435
Why me?

00:17:12.435 --> 00:17:13.885
If you want to keep it secret

00:17:13.885 --> 00:17:17.686
you have to help me
Got it ?

00:17:17.686 --> 00:17:22.403
I’m not afraid of what you said

00:17:22.403 --> 00:17:25.377
it's because you're like my brother

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:27.148
so you're willing to help?

00:17:27.148 --> 00:17:28.862

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.902
Yep

00:17:30.902 --> 00:17:31.615

00:17:35.176 --> 00:17:36.036
Ok!

00:17:42.212 --> 00:17:44.960
So…I’ll get better soon right?

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.871
Yes, it’ll be fine but things take time

00:17:48.871 --> 00:17:52.960
You’ve to take a good care of yourself as well

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.996
NK Complex Plus...

00:17:56.996 --> 00:17:58.371
How does it help? 

00:17:58.371 --> 00:18:01.618
I didn’t catch what you’ve said recently

00:18:01.618 --> 00:18:09.427

00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:15.200

00:18:38.377 --> 00:18:43.845
Isn’t that deep enough? 

00:18:43.845 --> 00:18:45.823
Nope. Do you want to know more? 

00:18:45.823 --> 00:18:47.691

I’m not only good looking but also smart LOL

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.499
(sigh)

00:19:32.521 --> 00:19:38.687
You have to take a long rest after work

00:19:38.687 --> 00:19:41.899
I’m concerned

00:19:46.126 --> 00:19:47.975
Can't it be something else? 

00:19:47.975 --> 00:19:50.034
Whatever...

00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:56.024
How it’s going Win?	

00:19:56.024 --> 00:19:58.024
You’ve been working here almost 3 weeks

Oh…how about Beam? 

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.360
The girl you’re dating with

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.147
You guys keep contacting ?

00:20:17.147 --> 00:20:18.332
None of your business

00:20:18.332 --> 00:20:19.955
What?

00:20:19.955 --> 00:20:23.264

Texting, calling and VDO calling sometime

00:20:31.635 --> 00:20:33.368
Hmm..

00:20:33.368 --> 00:20:35.680
I think she’s nice   

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.277
so you forget Beauty now?

00:20:39.277 --> 00:20:41.602
Minie !!

00:20:41.602 --> 00:20:45.391
I think you should stay silent then he’ll forget everything

00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:47.160
What a question !!!

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.840
Hey !!
Why do you have to interrupt me ?

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.349
I didn’t forget her 

00:20:54.349 --> 00:20:57.489
but I understand life situation little by little 

00:20:57.489 --> 00:20:58.678
Good for you !

00:20:58.678 --> 00:21:02.222
We’re so happy to see you’re getting better

00:21:02.222 --> 00:21:08.967

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.648

00:21:24.648 --> 00:21:28.655
Well…I’ll think about that again

00:21:28.655 --> 00:21:30.655

00:21:33.155 --> 00:21:40.449

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.800

00:22:14.491 --> 00:22:19.588

00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:20.686

Please help me bring the tree home

00:22:29.734 --> 00:22:33.600
You'll leave small girl to do this alone?

Win
Do you believe in fate?

00:23:11.583 --> 00:23:13.142

00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:14.909
Fate? 
Sound crazy !!!

00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:19.563
Nothing interesting about that

00:23:19.563 --> 00:23:23.009
Right? Fate ? No...

00:23:23.009 --> 00:23:26.070

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.066

00:23:28.066 --> 00:23:29.595
Are you trying to hide something?

00:25:24.244 --> 00:25:27.004
Do you hear piano playing?

I forgot to tell you about my boss’s children

00:25:33.094 --> 00:25:35.094
What is it?

00:25:35.094 --> 00:25:38.054
Hmm....

00:25:38.054 --> 00:25:40.418
They’re a bit naughty 

00:25:40.418 --> 00:25:44.789
Not a big deal James
