00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.560
You're the only one for me.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.240
I want you to know,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.800
that I'll never leave you.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.960
You're the only one that I miss.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.200
I want you to know,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.000
that I'll never look at someone else. 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.920
You'll always be the only one in my heart.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.280
Love you / Love (I guess)

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.680
Then, Boss' big hand moves to pull Tono's shirt.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.960
Then Boss kisses at Tono's neck that red mark can be seen.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.600
Tono moans with pleasure at the same beat of those kisses.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.440
His body move forward and backward at the same time.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.760
Boss couldn't hold it back anymore,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.160
so he...

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.360
What the heck?

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.960
Is it too easy?

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.200
Do I look that easy?

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.280
But you're getting famous.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.680
There're so many readers.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.280
When there're many readers, next they will make it into tv series.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.320
And your series will be famous. Famous!

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.160
It'll be famous for sure, trust me.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.000
Famous, my ass. Who on earth write about me?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.200
Damn, why is this happening to me?

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.400
Put away that sad filter.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400
It's actually fun.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.840
It isn't.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.360
Where are you?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.960
Whose room is it? Whose house is it?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.720
Your new boyfriend's?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.920
Air con in my room is broken,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.520
So I'm hanging at my brother's.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.400
Why? Jealous?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.920
Shut up.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.680
Look, my reputation that I've been building.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.680
I think it's good. It's not that bad.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.920
It's bad. It is very bad.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.520
One second, it is kissing.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.640
Another second, it is making love.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.120
It looks like a porn fiction.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.480
Are you blaming the writer?

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.320
Yes. 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.720
Maybe. No. I don't know

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.120
It's your fault.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.200
You have to find who the writer is.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.360
How so?

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.320
You have to find who it is. I'll go now.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.960
You're ordering me like I'm your boyfriend.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.800
Let me read it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.400
Or maybe it is my brother...

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.280
Who is that? His new boyfriend?

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.600
Ter.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.080
Oh, is that his brother?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.240
Do you have anything to say to Tono?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.160
I'm really sorry.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.560
I didn't think that you will dislike it that much.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.840
But I've deleted all of them. You don't have to worry.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.040
That's fine.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.240
Actually, I'm not really against it.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.480
You don't have to listen to Boss.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.560
What? you didn't say like this last time.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.720
Stop

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.920
But, I'm really sorry.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.480
I've decided...

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.120
to stop writing.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.920
You can continue writing.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.800
I'm waiting to read the last chapter,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.560
to see how Boss and Tono...

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.160
will end up.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.200
Really?

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.840
Yes, really.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.960
But please cut the love scene out a bit.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.440
I'm actually an innocent person. People will get it all wrong.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.400
Of course.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.800
Are you sure to let Ter continue his writing?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.200
Yes, I'm sure.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.520
I would be sad too if someone ruin my dream.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.880
I can see the passion in his eyes.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.000
So, what do you think my passion is?

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.800
Your body? I see you live so well.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.680
Nope.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.760
It is you.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.840
I'm losing appetite now.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.360
I'm being serious. I'd go to see you if I can.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.160
We can meet after Covid.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.440
Really? You're really coming to see me?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.400
Umm.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.040
So you would stop calling if we meet.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.280
I'll see you other time then.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.320
Why is that?

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.520
I'm afraid that you'll be gone if we meet.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.120
Don't be so serious.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.920
I'm not going anywhere.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.560
Don't go anywhere then, promise?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.960
Promise.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.520
Guys, I have to say,

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.760
everyone has to know

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.880
about Boss and Tono.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.640
Every plastforms and every updates

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.800
are all talking about BossTono.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.760
Even I can't resist to join their fandom.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.520
They are so cute.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.320
Cute with a capital C.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.840
You guys know what I mean by capital C, right?

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.320
They're so cute like...

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.920
CUTE, like this.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.880
Another thing that I'm wondering is...

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.280
are they just an imagine couple,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.160
or are they a real one.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.160
Today is a special day,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.560
that we're getting to talk with the real Boss and Tono.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.760
Tono,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.440
Have you ever met Boss in real life?

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.040
No, never.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.200
I see. Never, right?

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.040
So.. what do you like about him.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.560
I like...

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.760
everything about him.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.600
Where did the screaming come from?

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.240
Oh, it the sound effect.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.400
I pressed it.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.760
Let's ask Boss.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.040
What about you? What do you like about Tono?

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.640
But, wait.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.760
I've heard from an inside that,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.360
You're the one who texted Tono first, right?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.800
That's right.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.760
You're quite a bad boy.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.400
At least, my inside story is correct.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.480
Let's continue with Boss.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.360
What about you?

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.000
What is your first impression with Tono?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.280
Actually...

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.000
I've been secretly having a crush on him for some times.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.440
So, can we call you two...

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.880
a lover?

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.520
Well...

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.720
if he agrees then, yes.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.160
What're you talking about?

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.280
So, not yet. He hasn't agreed with it yet.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.640
Let not wait any time.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.120
I have a fun game for you today.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.240
I have an online mind guessing game,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.680
for Boss and Tono to play.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.080
So we will all know whether these two

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.640
really know each other.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.000
Okay. Are you ready?

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.080
Boss, what is Tono's favourite food?

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.080
Mackerel.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200
Correct.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.680
What about Tono? What is Boss' favourite food?

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.160
Well...

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.960
many things.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.960
Time's up.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.560
Next question. Listen carefully.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.480
Where was the most recent country that Boss visited?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.040
Laos.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.040
It's Myanmar.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.640
Next, what is Boss' favourite pet?

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.840
Cat.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.000
Wrong.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.640
How many siblings does Tono have?

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.560
He's an only child.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.440
Correct.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.400
What is Boss' favourite fruit?

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.000
Watermelon?

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.200
Wrong.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.640
Boss...

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.400
i'm sorry.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.840
You know almost everything about me.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.920
But I...

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.040
barely know anything about you?

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.240
Don't worry.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.040
I'm the one,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.320
who barely tell you anything about myself. 

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.440
Let's open up and slowly learn about each other.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.720
Okay.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.720
Let's learn about each for a long long time, until we gradute,

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.640
until we retire, until we are old.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.880
Silly.
