1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,221
Just tell me honestly,
What do you really feel about me?

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:04,880
I'm just a bodyguard.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,953
No right to be something else.

4
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:09,981
What's just happened?

5
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:11,213
I don't know.

6
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:15,602
I'll tell dad I want another guy.

7
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,939
-Young master...
-I don't want you...

8
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:18,732
to be my bodyguard anymore.

9
00:00:20,356 --> 00:00:21,550
Was it your doing?

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,951
I've warned you, Sakkhee.

11
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:24,743
Don't mess with my son.

12
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:26,857
Dad said when everything's done.

13
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:28,146
He'll send another guy.

14
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:53,866
Young master.

15
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:03,683
What is it?

16
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:13,264
Hey.

17
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:20,393
How did you get it?

18
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,132
What were you thinking?

19
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,940
They were gifts from you.

20
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:18,579
They mean a lot to me.

21
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:32,061
I'll help.

22
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,935
Don't take it off.

23
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,057
How is everything?

24
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:41,028
I've contacted and gathered
all our guys, sir.

25
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:43,457
Good.

26
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,553
Since I have nothing left to lose,

27
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:49,912
you'll lose everything too, Phu.

28
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,769
Are you free today, Toktaeng, Juno?

29
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:20,999
Absolutely, why?

30
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:23,312
I want to ask you out for a date.

31
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,665
Really?

32
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,316
Cool.

33
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,046
So, we'll all go together,

34
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,332
as a double date, alright?

35
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:42,759
A double date? Yes.

36
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:58,908
Do you have a problem with that?

37
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:14,917
Do you know where the restroom is, Juno?

38
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:17,351
A restroom, over there.

39
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:20,503
Excuse me for a bit.

40
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:23,220
Juno, can you take me there?

41
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,773
You guys wait here.
Then we'll go in together.

42
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:26,792
Okay.

43
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,394
Why are you doing this, young master?

44
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:43,181
What? I'm going out for a date.

45
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:47,447
In fact,
I want to be alone with Toktaeng.

46
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:51,161
But I knew that
you have to butt in anyway.

47
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:53,113
So I invited Juno to come along.

48
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:55,893
It's obvious that she has a crush on you.

49
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,681
You've never had a lover.
Isn't it great though?

50
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:07,655
If you order, I'll do it.

51
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:11,405
If I order you to go to hell,
will you do it?

52
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,505
You can try that, young master.

53
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,717
Sorry to make you wait.

54
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,018
It's alright.

55
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:29,044
I think we should part here.

56
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:33,246
There are a lot of cute backgrounds
to take photos with.

57
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:34,832
Toktaeng, do you want to take a look,

58
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,403
or order some snacks first?

59
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,371
Sounds good, I want to take a photo.

60
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:45,488
Sun, can you take a photo for me?

61
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,662
Let's go.

62
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:44,976
It looks nice here.

63
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,870
Can we sit down and take a selfie?

64
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,346
Then we'll catch up with them later.

65
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,873
-Sit here.
-Alright.

66
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,454
Let's take a selfie.

67
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:03,269
Sky, look at the camera.

68
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:05,532
One, two, three.

69
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,734
Again.

70
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:14,224
Here, Sky, look here.

71
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:16,848
One, two, three.

72
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,719
Hey, it's cute.

73
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,472
Sky...

74
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,567
Sky?

75
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,706
What?

76
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:44,387
Are you okay?

77
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:53,856
Thank you.

78
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,323
I'll take a photo for a sec.

79
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:04,872
Alright.

80
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,654
Sun...

81
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:30,758
Sun?

82
00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:35,589
You're sweating a lot.
I'll give you a tissue.

83
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,403
Toktaeng, I'm feeling unwell.
I'll go back first.

84
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,763
Wait, Sky!

85
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:00,601
Sky!

86
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:20,563
Please stop doing this, young master.
It's dangerous.

87
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,959
You'll always find me anyway.

88
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,071
Young master,
you can do whatever you like,

89
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:29,494
but don't put yourself in danger.

90
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,535
Alright, I'll go back to Toktaeng.

91
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:37,653
Let go.

92
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:38,873
No, sir.

93
00:11:39,428 --> 00:11:40,654
We should go home.

94
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,968
I don't want to.

95
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,136
Tok...

96
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:34,732
Young master.

97
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,014
What do you want from me?

98
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,793
I have to protect you.

99
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,520
I didn't mean why you dragged me here.

100
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,716
I ask you, what do you want
to do with my heart?

101
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:01,481
The reason you took care of me...

102
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:06,503
Was it just because you're my bodyguard?

103
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,706
Tell me,

104
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,078
you protected me,

105
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,198
did everything for me,

106
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,847
you don't have any feelings for me.

107
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:33,634
I...

108
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,455
You what?

109
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,457
You tell me.

110
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:48,131
Tell me,
that you also have feelings for me,

111
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,118
that you love me.

112
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:02,893
Say it!

113
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:07,830
Say it, say you love me.

114
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,466
You say it now.

Let go of me.

133
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:57,317
Young master!

134
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,255
Sun!

135
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:06,413
Sun!

136
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:08,470
-Go.
-Sun...

137
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:10,888
Young master.

138
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:23,549
Sun, wake up.

139
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:24,962
Sun.

140
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,666
Mr. Bank, Mr. Pitch?

141
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,783
How did you get here?

142
00:16:44,863 --> 00:16:48,014
I've seen Juno posted on her FB
that you guys are dating.

143
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:49,668
So, I followed you here.

144
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:53,992
What happened? Who did that to you?

145
00:16:56,677 --> 00:16:57,977
Sky...

146
00:16:58,057 --> 00:16:59,737
Sky was kidnapped.

147
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,275
What?

148
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:05,559
I've downloaded a tracking application
on his mobile.

149
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,537
I'll follow them.

150
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:15,616
Hey, hang on, I'll go with you.

151
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:17,193
Sky is also my friend.

152
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:19,378
Then, we'll go help too.

153
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,542
But, I think you two should go back first.

154
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:25,830
It's dangerous. We'll handle this.

155
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,878
-My car is this way.
-Go.

156
00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:48,434
Asshole!

157
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,302
Be polite to your elders.

158
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:55,805
Didn't your dad teach you that?

159
00:17:56,203 --> 00:17:59,714
You think my dad will let you get away,
doing this to me.

160
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:01,697
Actually, I want him to know.

161
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:07,590
He should realise what he would get
from burning off my factory.

162
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,917
Sakkhee?

163
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,443
Yeah, it's me.

164
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:19,546
You know what?

165
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,191
Your father was a pain in the ass.

166
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:27,308
This time, I'll make him buried alive.

167
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:33,897
Have you gone nuts? What will you do?

168
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:42,222
How's it going, Sakkhee?

169
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:45,203
Where have you been hidden?

170
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:48,916
It's not important where I am, it's all...

171
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,203
Who I'm with.

172
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:54,396
-Dad!
-Sky.

173
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:56,263
Dad, help me, dad!

174
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,053
Sakkhee, what did you do to him?

175
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,746
Dad, help me.

176
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,670
Sakkhee!

177
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,760
If you hurt him, I'll kill you.

178
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,454
Before I die,

179
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:18,599
your son's already a cold body, Phu.

180
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,469
Don't worry.
I'll leave his body for you.

181
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:25,631
If you still remember his face though.

182
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:28,704
Sakkhee!

183
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,467
Boss, Sun just called me.

184
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,534
He's heading to help young master.

185
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:39,236
Good, tell him to send his location.

186
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,565
You gather all our guys.

187
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:43,767
I'll end all of this.

188
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:44,941
Yes, sir.

189
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,129
Boss, boss.

190
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,164
The nearby factory is on fire.

191
00:19:59,244 --> 00:20:00,853
Why the heck is it on fire?

192
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,225
You two, guard here, the rest follow me.

193
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,332
Hey, it was really his plan.

194
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:22,509
He dares come to get beaten.

195
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:25,718
Aren't you too bold for your size?

196
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:28,872
Hey, where you think you going?

197
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:32,205
The exit is this way.

198
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,664
Thanks, bro.

199
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,363
You can't escape now.

200
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,860
Are you really going to do this?
Alright.

201
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,937
His moves look scary.

202
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:48,124
Loser!

203
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:51,587
I'll teach you
how we do in a real fight.

204
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,925
Ouch, it hurts, bro.

205
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:12,503
You alright?

206
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,685
I'm fine.

207
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:14,798
Let's go.

208
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:47,942
Young master.

209
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:29,790
Why aren't they back yet?

210
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:31,666
Yeah, bro.

211
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:42,203
So, you're so low to the point
you use a weapon.

212
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:45,751
Don't you know, this knife...

213
00:23:46,295 --> 00:23:48,552
also stabbed through that loser's heart.

214
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:52,237
You and your master should be happy,

215
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,254
to die by this very same knife.

216
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:50,756
You three, go look around there.

217
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:52,236
Yes, boss!

218
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,004
You think luring me out
by the fire will work, huh?

219
00:25:01,462 --> 00:25:02,914
I double-cross you.

220
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:06,109
Your bodyguard, huh.

221
00:25:06,866 --> 00:25:09,214
My underling will beat him
to the ground.

222
00:25:09,565 --> 00:25:10,938
You wait just a bit,

223
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:13,998
I'll let him cut off his head for you.

224
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,248
Dad!

225
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:22,300
Bastard!

226
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,531
Hey.

227
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:25,751
Young master!

228
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:30,062
There are gunshots, bro.

229
00:25:31,228 --> 00:25:32,841
Why isn't Sky's dad here yet?

230
00:25:33,804 --> 00:25:35,219
What should we do, bro?

231
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,308
You wait here, I'll go.

232
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:41,984
Hold on, bro.

233
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,960
It's dangerous.

234
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:46,212
I'll go too.

235
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:04,876
Where you think you're running off to?

236
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,912
Hey, you bastard.

237
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,124
You can't get away from me.

238
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:20,483
I'm not afraid.

239
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:24,673
Retard, what a mouth you have.

240
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:30,406
Earlier, I planned to kill you
in front of your dad.

241
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:34,395
But you little wench, should die here.

242
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,991
I'll picture how your dad's
gone nuts later.

243
00:26:52,468 --> 00:26:53,585
Young master.

244
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,274
Young master!

245
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:18,482
Young master...

246
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:20,155
Young master, are you okay?

247
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,781
I'm fine.

248
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:24,890
Are you okay?

249
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,644
I'm fine.

250
00:27:33,008 --> 00:27:34,235
Let's get out of here.

251
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:38,094
Hurry up, find them.

252
00:27:38,174 --> 00:27:39,293
Go!

253
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:43,997
Hey, that way.

254
00:27:44,077 --> 00:27:46,425
Hey!

255
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:47,956
Stop. Stop...

256
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:49,220
Stop there!

257
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:51,725
I said stop!

258
00:27:57,574 --> 00:27:59,889
Where do you think you're running off to?

259
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:03,792
Hey, over there.

260
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,512
Come on, try me.

261
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:07,943
Come on.

262
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:09,366
Go.

263
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:12,586
Hey!

264
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:15,630
Where are you going?

265
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:29,415
Hey, Pitch, what do we do?

266
00:28:30,003 --> 00:28:31,325
Come here.

267
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:40,705
Watch out!

268
00:29:07,027 --> 00:29:08,430
Get out of the way!

269
00:29:09,768 --> 00:29:11,369
Get him!

270
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:18,854
Young master!

271
00:29:30,662 --> 00:29:32,168
Hey, stay back.

272
00:29:32,743 --> 00:29:33,695
Stay back.

273
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:50,002
Young master, watch out!

274
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,800
Stay down.

275
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:22,966
Sun.

276
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:25,184
Sun...

277
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,336
Stay with me.

278
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,325
Sun.

279
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:36,409
Go, Shain!

280
00:30:43,572 --> 00:30:46,035
Stay with me.

281
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:49,381
Young master.

282
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:53,069
You've got to be okay, Sun,
stay with me.

283
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:54,364
You'll be alright.

284
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:57,413
Don't leave me, Sun.

285
00:30:57,994 --> 00:30:59,720
Don't leave me, Sun.

286
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,059
Sky!

287
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:03,289
Sun, Sun!

288
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:06,811
You've got to be alright.

289
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:08,349
Sun!

290
00:31:11,323 --> 00:31:13,286
Sun, wake up, Sun!

291
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:14,961
I don't want this, Sun.

292
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,297
How can I live without you, Sun.

293
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:13,344
Doctor!

294
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,077
How is he?

295
00:32:15,522 --> 00:32:17,932
The bullet didn't injure any main organs.

296
00:32:18,475 --> 00:32:20,831
But the patient has lost a lot of blood.

297
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,301
The hospital is trying to find
more blood for him.

298
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,594
Take my blood,
I used to donate my blood.

299
00:32:28,718 --> 00:32:30,037
Me, too.

300
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:31,667
You can't.

301
00:32:31,747 --> 00:32:33,867
Patient has a very special blood-type,

302
00:32:33,948 --> 00:32:37,313
called "RH-null" or Golden Blood.

303
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:42,296
What is it, doc?

304
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,604
Normally, our blood-type...

305
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:52,552
are O, B, AB,

306
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,791
either positive or negative.

307
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:03,118
But golden blood is AB Rh-negative.

308
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:08,094
There are only 20,000
out of 70 million people.

309
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,331
How do you know all that?

310
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:15,138
That doesn't matter.

311
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:18,529
The thing is...

312
00:33:19,054 --> 00:33:22,344
How can we find the rare blood for Sun?

313
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:26,759
Right, bro, where do we find that?

314
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:31,807
Doctor.

315
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:34,514
I have golden blood.

316
00:33:36,033 --> 00:33:37,845
I'm afraid that's not enough.

317
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,707
Because the patient needs a lot of blood.

318
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:42,991
I'll take my leave.

319
00:34:25,171 --> 00:34:26,367
Sky.

320
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,523
How are you?

321
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,611
Dad.

322
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,232
Sun.

323
00:34:46,439 --> 00:34:48,898
There's not enough blood to help Sun.

324
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:53,078
Even if I donated my blood,
it will be hard to save him.

325
00:34:55,432 --> 00:34:57,632
You don't need to give him your blood.

326
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,562
How can I not?

327
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,300
Sun also has a rare blood-type.

328
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,659
And he's dying because he saved me.

329
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:11,005
Calm down, Sky.

330
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:17,488
Listen to me, Sky.

331
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,927
Sun will be alright.

332
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:27,100
I've already contacted the staff
to bring the blood Sun's been donated.

333
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,181
He's on his way here.

334
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:33,799
Sun will be alright.

335
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:40,093
Has Sun been donating blood?

336
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,197
It's the reason I adopted him
in the first place.

337
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:53,199
Reason?

338
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:58,449
You adopted Sun
to keep his blood for me?

339
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:04,623
Since the day we lost your mother.

340
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,733
I swear...

341
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,223
they won't happen ever again.

342
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:27,094
Are you ready?

343
00:36:28,046 --> 00:36:29,853
Where are you going, Sky?

344
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:30,938
Come here.

345
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:44,225
Mom.

346
00:36:44,758 --> 00:36:46,473
Mom.

347
00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:47,865
Mom.

348
00:36:47,945 --> 00:36:50,277
Mom, wake up!

349
00:36:51,006 --> 00:36:53,776
Mom...

350
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,844
Doctor.

351
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,523
I'm sorry for your loss.

352
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:13,875
We've done our best for her.

353
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:19,466
Due to too much blood loss...

354
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:24,625
Moreover, her blood-type is very rare.

355
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,399
We've performed our best.

356
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:32,397
I'm sorry for your loss.

357
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:35,193
Yes.

358
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,634
Thank you.

359
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:57,102
Your mother's blood-type
is also golden blood.

360
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:04,697
I swear it won't happen to you.

361
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:10,001
I tried to find someone
who had the same blood-type as you.

362
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:13,765
Then, I found Sun.

363
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:16,940
Have you ever considered his feelings?

364
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:21,999
Sky, everything that I did is for you.

365
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:29,233
Sun is also a human being.

366
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,974
He's alive and has feelings too.

367
00:38:33,452 --> 00:38:38,055
What you did to him
is like a cave animal.

368
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:43,180
I just wanted to protect you, Sky.

369
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,884
I ordered him to learn self-defense.

370
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:49,385
You know what for?

371
00:38:50,232 --> 00:38:52,272
To protect you.

372
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:54,874
I don't need that, dad.

373
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:59,031
It's all because of you.
Sun doesn't get to live like others.

374
00:39:00,895 --> 00:39:05,356
If I didn't do that, would you have
spare blood to use, Sky.

375
00:39:05,436 --> 00:39:09,024
Why don't you understand?
Your blood is very rare.

376
00:39:09,104 --> 00:39:11,071
How precious is it?

377
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:15,948
More importantly,
Sun is willing to do that too.

378
00:39:16,448 --> 00:39:20,586
He agreed to donate his blood
every three months.

379
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:23,334
You've got to understand me.

380
00:39:24,273 --> 00:39:28,314
Do I have to be happy
knowing that how Sun...

381
00:39:28,394 --> 00:39:33,366
think of his life as nothing,
nothing but only his blood.

382
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,920
Sky!

383
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,400
Everything has been taken care of.

384
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:11,666
Good.

385
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,663
Boss, do you want me to escort
young master back first?

386
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:27,385
Even if you drag him, he wouldn't go.

387
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,666
I've never seen young master
acting like that.

388
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:37,465
Me, too.

389
00:42:55,182 --> 00:42:56,583
How's Sun?

390
00:43:03,938 --> 00:43:05,302
Still unconscious.

391
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,892
But over all,
he's over the critical stage.

392
00:43:17,565 --> 00:43:21,791
We couldn't believe it
when Bank told us.

393
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:28,532
Did the doctor say anything
about when he'll be awake?

394
00:43:35,678 --> 00:43:39,965
Hey, guys, a man like Sun
will definitely get better soon.

395
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:41,839
Right, Pitch?

396
00:43:44,784 --> 00:43:47,370
He won't die that easily.

397
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:57,856
How are you, Sky?

398
00:43:59,327 --> 00:44:00,881
Have you gotten enough sleep?

399
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:08,439
Right now, I'm alright.

400
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:14,621
I want Sun to regain consciousness soon.

401
00:45:22,438 --> 00:45:23,636
Sky.

402
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:27,431
You've been watching him for many days.

403
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:30,421
You should go home and have some rest.

404
00:45:31,048 --> 00:45:32,276
I don't want to.

405
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:36,788
Young master, you should take some rest
before you get sick too.

406
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:39,906
I said I won't go, you hear me?

407
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:43,441
Alright, son.

408
00:45:43,948 --> 00:45:45,398
Alright.

409
00:45:46,547 --> 00:45:49,577
I'll bring you some clothes.

410
00:46:00,033 --> 00:46:01,138
Sun.

411
00:46:03,633 --> 00:46:04,779
I love you.

412
00:46:10,118 --> 00:46:12,173
Can you open your eyes?

413
00:46:32,193 --> 00:46:33,672
Please, I beg you.

414
00:46:36,232 --> 00:46:37,564
Please, wake up.

415
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,219
I'll go to the hospital, bye.

416
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:01,212
Wait, Sky.

417
00:47:04,968 --> 00:47:07,162
Sakkhee's already been caught.

418
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:11,184
I think you don't need
a bodyguard anymore.

419
00:47:12,137 --> 00:47:14,437
When he gets better,

420
00:47:14,925 --> 00:47:17,057
I'll bring him back to work with me.

421
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,868
No, dad, Sun should stay here with me.

422
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,217
Sky.

423
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:28,300
You didn't want a bodyguard at first,
did you?

424
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:31,033
You said you want your freedom.

425
00:47:31,713 --> 00:47:35,357
But now,
I want to finish the school with him, dad.

426
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:42,385
I know, now you feel attached to Sun.

427
00:47:43,098 --> 00:47:44,829
Because he saved your life.

428
00:47:45,243 --> 00:47:47,590
But don't forget that it's also his job.

429
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,290
I don't want you to cross the boundary.

430
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,753
You have no right to decide
for me or Sun.

431
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:56,554
I didn't decide for anyone. It's a fact.

432
00:47:58,528 --> 00:48:00,477
He's brought up for that reason.

433
00:48:01,856 --> 00:48:04,371
Do you only see him as your pet?

434
00:48:05,894 --> 00:48:09,350
Both Sun and I will make a decision
for ourselves.

435
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:42,915
Bro, I took notes
from the classes for you.

436
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:44,466
Here.

437
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,267
Hey.

438
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,342
Are you listening to me?

439
00:48:54,994 --> 00:48:56,228
What did you say?

440
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,822
I said I took notes
from today's lectures.

441
00:49:05,062 --> 00:49:08,850
Are you alright? You look absent-minded.

442
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:12,532
I think you should have some rest.

443
00:49:14,813 --> 00:49:16,500
You look like shit.

444
00:49:17,326 --> 00:49:18,805
I'm alright.

445
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:24,103
I want to watch him
until he's conscious.

446
00:49:26,751 --> 00:49:29,962
I know you're worried about him.

447
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:34,698
But if he knows you are like this,
he'd be sad.

448
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:39,419
You know how much he cares for you.

449
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:46,672
He cares about me
only because it's his job.

450
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:50,051
Not like how I care about him.

451
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:58,812
Thanks for the notes.

452
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,971
Yeah.

453
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:36,366
It's been so long.
Why isn't he waking up?

454
00:50:36,864 --> 00:50:40,237
He's been severely injured.

455
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:42,442
It's not fair.

456
00:50:43,313 --> 00:50:46,069
Why did he have to take the shot?

457
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:53,272
Though, he's a distant relative
and also his bodyguard.

458
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:56,552
What if...

459
00:50:58,165 --> 00:50:59,925
Sun never regains consciousness?

460
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:17,316
Hey, it's not like you to say that.

461
00:51:19,573 --> 00:51:21,157
The Juno I know...

462
00:51:23,922 --> 00:51:25,385
always has hope.

463
00:51:28,165 --> 00:51:29,312
Thanks.

464
00:51:38,756 --> 00:51:39,926
Sun.

465
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:43,158
Sun, you've got to come back.

466
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:50,898
Or else I'll give you a kiss
to wake you up like a sleeping beauty.

467
00:52:17,792 --> 00:52:21,509
If my dad won't approve,
will you die for the sake of true love?

468
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:22,796
Well, you can try dying first.

469
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:25,743
When you get discharged,
can we go on a date?

470
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:28,051
Sun and I, we're in love.

471
00:52:28,131 --> 00:52:31,324
You might feel bad,
and responsible for his life.

472
00:52:31,404 --> 00:52:33,005
Because he took the bullet for you.

473
00:52:33,085 --> 00:52:34,949
Sun also has a heart, dad.

474
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:37,807
He's not a thing nor a pet.

475
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:42,619
You boldly dare to mess
with my only son, huh?

476
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:43,972
Get rid of him!
