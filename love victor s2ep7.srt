00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,961
VICTOR: Here you go.
CUSTOMER: Thank you.

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,588
‐ Sorry I’m late.

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,757
I had that dream again
where the Hemsworth brothers

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,258
teach me how to surf.
‐ Mmm.

5
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,010
‐ Still holding out hope
that it’s a premonition.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,596
‐ [chuckles] Well, lucky for you,

7
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,182
today’s the only day
you’re allowed to be late.

8
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,558
Happy birthday.

9
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,976
[laughs]

10
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,605
And I’m glad you slept in,
'cause I can't have you tired for tonight.

11
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,940
I have big plans for us.

12
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,650
‐ Oh, yeah? What kind of plans?

13
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,694
‐ Uh, let's just say I may have "borrowed"

14
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,072
a bottle of champagne from
my mom's wine cabinet.

15
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,908
A little bit of drinking,
a little bit of fooling around.

16
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,619
And that’s all I have planned.
Should I have tried a little bit harder?

17
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,454
‐ No. No, that's perfect.

18
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:41,083
My parents should be out cold after this
bougie dinner they’re dragging me to.

19
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,459
‐ I'm sure it won't be that bad.

20
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,878
‐ You haven’t heard my mom
try and impress a French waiter

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,630
with her pronunciation of ratatouille.

22
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,632
[laughs]
[door opens]

23
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,884
Oh, wow. I accidentally summoned her.

24
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,427
‐ Hi, boys.

25
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,263
‐ Hey.
‐ Ooh!

26
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,265
Said it before and I’ll say it again,

27
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,892
the softest cheeks in Creekwood.

28
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,645
Can you believe this sneaky cat
left the house

29
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,398
without letting his own mother
wish him a happy birthday?

30
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,191
Happy birthday, darling.

31
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,777
It’s a pain au chocolat from Café Jacquot.

32
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:12,030
‐ Odd gift, considering I’m surrounded
by pastries all day.

33
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,284
But it's very sweet. Thank you, Mom.
MARGARET: Mmm.

34
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,577
Oh, Benji, before I go,

35
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,746
could you make me one of those
delicious oat milk lattes?

36
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,999
‐ Sure, Mother.
[Victor chuckles]

37
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,585
‐ Okay. The coast is clear.

38
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:29,381
I’m sure Benji mentioned that
we’re taking him to Chez Luisant tonight.

39
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,925
Well, I was hoping that you could join us.

40
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,427
As a fun surprise for him.

41
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,304
‐ Yeah! Yeah, of course. That'd be great.

42
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,764
‐ Oh, wonderful.
You may want to dress up a bit.

43
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,601
But don’t worry, it isn't, um,
hoity‐toity. It's more, um,

44
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,144
cozy chic.

45
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,815
Mmm. Oh, I'm gonna take a rain check
on the latte.

46
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:50,736
My, uh, my matcha's just kicked in
and I'm feeling a little buzzy.

47
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,071
I can't wait to celebrate you later.

48
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,282
Bye, Victor.
VICTOR: Bye.

49
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,367
‐ Did my mom just wink at you?

50
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,329
‐ That's how you pay your respects
to "the softest cheeks in Creekwood."

51
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,291
‐ Softest, huh? Let me see.
‐ [laughing] Hey! Come here.

52
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,252
‐ ♪ Somebody to tell me
it'll be all right ♪

53
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,172
♪ Somebody to tell me
it'll be just fine ♪

54
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,467
♪ If someone has been there before,
say it right now ♪

55
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,802

56
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,850
♪

57
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,644
‐ This is nice.

58
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,063
‐ Yeah, it's fine.
[keyboard keys clicking]

59
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,608
Is it me or does it feel like
we have a very emotional chaperone?

60
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,736
MIA:
Give her a break.

61
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,489
Felix still won’t talk to her.
She’s a mess.

62
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,407
I mean, she's not even wearing heels.

63
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,619
Her motto is usually
“give me three inches or give me death.”

64
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,456
‐ So Felix just barely made the cut.
Ho‐ho!

65
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:48,001
‐ [sighs] Okay. Andrew...

66
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,839
If Mia accidentally got your mom
committed to a 72‐hour psych hold,

67
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,174
which of these surprise dates
would make you forgive her:

68
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,927
a visit to the Jimmy Carter
Presidential Library,

69
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:00,347
or a visit to the
Center for Puppetry Arts. Be honest.

70
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,391
‐ These are real places?

71
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,351
God, Atlanta sucks.

72
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,603
‐ [sighs] Guys, this is serious.

73
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,272
I‐I really have to think of
something amazing

74
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,815
to remind Felix
how much I love him!

75
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,401
‐ Lake. [grunts] Breathe.

76
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,111
[exhales]

77
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,989
I’ll help you find
the perfect thing. Okay?

78
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,575
‐ Thank you.

79
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:22,661
Okay. Now I’m gonna go order us
a bunch of Chinese takeout,

80
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,705
like they do in movies where the lawyers
have to stay up all night

81
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,583
cracking the case. Okay? [sighs]

82
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,962
‐ I thought we were gonna order pizza.

83
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:36,466
‐ I know. I just need to be here
for Lake, is all.

84
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,178
Look, if we finish early,

85
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:43,140
we can order pizza from the
comfort of my bedroom.

86
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,145
LAKE:
Oh, uh, can you hold on for a second?

87
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,314
Guys. Guys!

88
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,191
Smash on your own time, okay?

89
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,193
A relationship hangs in the balance.

90
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,739
‐ Betrayed by my lover.

91
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:03,744
They took away my mother.
Will I ever recover?

92
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,330
‐ Uh, hey, Felix.

93
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,916
When was the last time you took a shower?

94
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,418
RAHIM: Yeah, you're really making me
regret having a nose.
[Felix sniffs]

95
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,504
My nose is my second favorite body part.

96
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,882
Wouldn't you like to know?

97
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,968
‐ All right. I'll go.

98
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,434
‐ Hey, would you guys be able to
keep an eye on him tonight?

99
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,229
Benji’s mom invited me to
Chez Luisant for his birthday.

100
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,773
‐ I heard J. Lo ate there every night
while she was staying here

101
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,566
filming that new movie
about being a scrappy mom

102
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,651
finding true love.

103
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,110
‐ Hasn't she already made that movie?
[shower facet turns, water runs]

104
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,446
‐ Oh, and every Avengers movie
is uniquely different.

105
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,450
You're not actually
gonna wear that, are you?

106
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,745
‐ Uh, yeah.
Benji’s mom said it’s "cozy meets chic."

107
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:50,666
‐ Are you sure you’re gay? I‐‐
I wash my hands of this. Ugh.

108
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,377
‐ Okay, don't‐‐ don't mind her.
We'll find you something to wear.

109
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,337
Something clean and classic.

110
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,797
You know‐‐

111
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,050
Okay, wow. You, you really love
the non‐descript athletic tee.

112
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,636
‐ Uh, well I could probably borrow
one of my dad's button‐ups.

113
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,805
Uh, you know, he, he's a little bit
bigger than I am,

114
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,974
but I could tuck it in.
‐ We're probably the same size, right?

115
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,767
‐ Oh, no, no, no.
It's, it's okay. Really‐‐

116
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,935
‐ It's fine.

117
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,399
And it's, uh,
it's last season St. Laurent, so...

118
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,234
try not to spill anything on it.

119
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,404
‐ Well, uh, try not to spill
anything on this, either,

120
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,906
because it is present day Old Navy.

121
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,368
‐ Cute.
[laughs]

122
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,079
Just... yeah.

123
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,331
‐ All right.
[laughs]

124
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,960
Oh, damn, Victor! Lookin' good.

125
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,546
That will be the first and last
time I ever catcall my brother.

126
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,340
[laughs]
‐ Hey, guys, there's snacks
in the kitchen.

127
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,552
Rahim, Keto friendly. I got you.
‐ Oh.

128
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,806
‐ [gasps] Mira que handsome.

129
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,474
[Isabel giggles]

130
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,312
Hold on. Your collar is all crooked.

131
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,730
There.

132
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,440
So guess where I'm going tonight.

133
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,986
My first PFLAG meeting.

134
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,613
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

135
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:06,783
I need a little advice
on how to talk to Adrian about...

136
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,202
who you are.

137
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,704
‐ Thank you.

138
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,876
‐ Thank you for being so patient with me.

139
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,214
‐ You guys are out of towels.

140
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,636
[indistinct chatter]

141
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,888
CHARLES:
It was so good meeting you.

142
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,766
‐ Well, look who the cat dragged in.

143
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,352
CHARLES:
And what a dapper cat he is.

144
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:36,021
Wait, Victor isn’t the cat.
He’s what the cat is dragging.

145
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,689
That is such a strange expression.

146
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,983
‐ Victor, what are you doing here?

147
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,861
‐ Uh, good to see you, too.

148
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,656
‐ No, sorry, I‐I just meant‐‐
‐ We asked Victor to join us

149
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,199
as a little birthday surprise.

150
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,784
VICTOR:
Ah, well, you guys look great.

151
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:53,205
I wasn’t totally sure what “cozy chic”
meant, but now I think I get it.

152
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:56,166
‐ It sounds like my wife gave you
one of her indecipherable dress codes.

153
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,877
Last week, it was
“fireside fashionable.“

154
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,587
MARGARET:
Well, no matter what I say,

00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,883
‐ No, no. I'm super into this.
‐ Mmm.

468
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:09,301
[chuckles]
‐ You have your phone in your hand,

469
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:11,094
and you're waiting for her to text you.

470
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:15,182
‐ Yes. Yes, because I was gonna record us.

471
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:18,894
I'm, I’m secretly super kinky. Surprise!
‐ Mmm.

472
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,271
‐ You need to get your mind off of Lake.
[doorbell rings]

473
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,649
And this pizza is gonna help you do that.

474
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,447
[door opens]
Oh, hey.

475
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:31,949
LAKE:
Hey.

476
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,954
Mia.

477
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:40,999
Felix broke up with me.

478
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:43,710
‐ Oh, God, I am so sorry.

479
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,671
‐ No, you were right.

480
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,840
I messed up big,
and I was just dumb to think

481
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,008
I could fix it with some romantic
night fish.

482
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,678
‐ Mmm, no. Don't blame yourself.

483
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,638
ANDREW:
You know what'll make you feel better?

484
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:57,224
Pizza. And you're in luck.

485
00:25:57,224 --> 00:26:00,102
It's just about to get here, so...
I'll bounce.

486
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:01,979
Give you two some privacy.

487
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,981
‐ [mouths]: Thank you.
[Lake sobbing]

488
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:08,485
Mmm. Aw... Tell me what happened.

489
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:10,153
Mmm.
