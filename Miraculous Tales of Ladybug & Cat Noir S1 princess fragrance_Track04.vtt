&lrm;No prob.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.500
&lrm;That is so sweet of you

&lrm;A friend of Chloe's?

&lrm;You must be kidding.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.700
&lrm;I mean, we're in the same class.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.220
&lrm;If you're not a friend,
&lrm;then I can't.

&lrm;Yes, I'm a friend of Chloe's.

&lrm;Don't get that peasant food near me.

&lrm;Wait! It has truffles
&lrm;and caviar on it,

&lrm;No need. I'm his princess.

&lrm;And I'm a monkey's uncle.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.060
&lrm;Anything to say
&lrm;about your official Parisian visit?

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.140
&lrm;[Prince Ali]
&lrm;I'm happy to be here.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.620
&lrm;Prince Ali, where is...

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.740
&lrm;that smell coming from?

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.220
&lrm;Like rotten fish.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.620
&lrm;[gagging]

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.860
&lrm;What? That's not me.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.980
&lrm;It is me!

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.340
&lrm;[singing]
&lrm;At your service, princess fragrance.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.580
&lrm;Who are you?

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.260
&lrm;I'm Princess Fragrance.
&lrm;I've come just for you.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.740
&lrm;In just a spritz,

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.300
&lrm;you'll be my Prince Ali.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.020
&lrm;This is bad.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.340
&lrm;What or who is that? Plagg?

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.180
&lrm;Plagg?
&lrm;There's trouble in Paris.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.540
&lrm;I'm still chewing.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.860
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.580
&lrm;[mayor]
&lrm;Prince, this way.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.300
&lrm;We're safe.
&lrm;It's a reinforced door.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.100
&lrm;So much chaos.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.620
&lrm;How is one supposed to stick
&lrm;to a schedule around here?

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.020
&lrm;What is that?

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.980
&lrm;[hissing]

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.900
&lrm;Get back!

&lrm;[vacuum cleaner]

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.660
&lrm;[Princess Fragrance]
&lrm;Seriously?

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.220
&lrm;Who are you?

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.700
&lrm;Looks like you're powerless now.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.420
&lrm;No!

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.180
&lrm;There are two of them now. Run!

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.340
&lrm;[singing]
&lrm;You can't escape my perfume.

&lrm;[Chloe]
&lrm;He's under the spell.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.740
&lrm;Shut the door.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.380
&lrm;-But it's your father.
&lrm;-Who cares?

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.580
&lrm;Shut it now!

&lrm;[servant]
&lrm;At your service.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.700
&lrm;[singing]
&lrm;Come into my arms,

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.940
&lrm;my sweet prince.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.340
&lrm;[Cat Noir gags]
&lrm;Can we get some fresh air in here?

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.060
&lrm;No-one will take my prince away!

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.140
&lrm;Emergency evacuation.
&lrm;Everybody down.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.980
&lrm;It's much too dangerous
&lrm;for the prince.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.860
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;You're right...

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.220
&lrm;safety first.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.380

&lrm;Tikki, please be OK.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.460
&lrm;Can we open the windows?

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.260
&lrm;This fish smell
&lrm;is even too much for a cat.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.780
&lrm;[Tikki sneezes]

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.460
&lrm;We've 9 minutes

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.540
&lrm;to get to the hospital,
&lrm;we're on a strict schedule.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.020
&lrm;No way we can go
&lrm;go to the hospital now.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.260
&lrm;We gotta get Prince Ali
&lrm;out of Paris.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.300
&lrm;My prince, fancy seeing you here,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.540
&lrm;what luck.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.740
&lrm;The windows!

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.260
&lrm;I'll take you to the Pont des Arts
&lrm;where we'll seal our love.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.620
&lrm;Cat Noir is down.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.060
&lrm;It won't be long

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.420
&lrm;before Ladybug shows up too
&lrm;and meets her doom.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.860
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.780
&lrm;No. Where's Tikki?

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.300
&lrm;Tikki?

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.780
&lrm;Tikki?

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.740
&lrm;Tikki, I was so worried.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.260
&lrm;Marinette...

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.420
&lrm;You're worse than I thought.
&lrm;We need to get help.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.940
&lrm;[Tikki]
&lrm;We have no time.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.140
&lrm;You need to transform.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.060
&lrm;I'll be OK.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.500
&lrm;[coughing]

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.300
&lrm;I'm not making
&lrm;the same mistake twice.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.700
&lrm;We've got to get you
&lrm;to the healer, now.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:42.700
&lrm;[Chinese gong rings]

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.060
&lrm;Is she gonna be OK?

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.820
&lrm;One who burns with impatience
&lrm;can never eat hot porridge.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.540
&lrm;What has this got to do with eating?

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.420
&lrm;Silence, please.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.220
&lrm;Reading energies...

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.220
&lrm;What type of cat did you say?

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.500
&lrm;Cat?...

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.300
&lrm;rare hairless flying species
&lrm;from the Kingdom of Atchoo.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.940
&lrm;I won one in a zoo tap-dancing
&lrm;contest when I was in... Atchoo.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.540
&lrm;I see, unusual.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.860
&lrm;Yes, yes, very.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.780
&lrm;[gong rings]
&lrm;We are finished.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.780
&lrm;Your cat's health has been restored.

&lrm;[Tikki mumbles]

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.940
&lrm;Thank you so much.
&lrm;You're a real magician, sir.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.940
&lrm;How did you do that?

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.180
&lrm;Ancient Chinese secret.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.420
&lrm;Just like yours.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.300
&lrm;Tikki, I'm so sorry.
&lrm;You were so sick and...

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.620
&lrm;I don't know
&lrm;what I'd do without you.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.740
&lrm;You wouldn't be Ladybug, for one.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.660
&lrm;I know, but I mean...

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.580
&lrm;Tikki, you're more
&lrm;than just my kwami to me.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.420
&lrm;I know.

&lrm;The Pont des Arts bridge,
&lrm;That's where they're headed.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.620
&lrm;I heard it in the car.
&lrm;Hurry, we've no time to lose.

&lrm;when I can put everyone
&lrm;under my spell

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.940
&lrm;and make Paris our kingdom?

&lrm;[hissing]

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.420
&lrm;I'd better do something

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.220
&lrm;before this whole thing
&lrm;blows up in my face.

&lrm;Watch what happens when you play
&lrm;with flammable substances...

&lrm;This city's not for us.
&lrm;Too many people want to bother us.

&lrm;Let's go far away from here,

&lrm;What do I do with this?

&lrm;You can't escape, Ladybug
&lrm;It's over!

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.780
&lrm;What the...?

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.100
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,

&lrm;What am I doing here?
&lrm;And where's Ladybug?

&lrm;kind-hearted person
&lrm;I have ever met.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.260
&lrm;Really?

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.780
&lrm;Prince Ali!

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.100
&lrm;You're safe.
&lrm;Aren't you glad I'm safe too?

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.940
&lrm;Shall we continue
&lrm;where we left off?

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.100
&lrm;No, thank you.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.620
&lrm;I have a special event
&lrm;at the hospital with Miss Rose.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.140
&lrm;Let us go quickly
&lrm;before my chaperone locates me.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.220
&lrm;Bye, Chloe.
