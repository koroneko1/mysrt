1
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,833
-Dad, are you driving to Chonburi?
-Yes.

2
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,208
I'm going straight there.

3
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,333
Buy me some crabs too.

4
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:12,875
Give me the money.

5
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,041
So stingy.

6
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,625
Don’t eat until tomorrow.

7
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:31,666
When I get back,

8
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:32,833
we'll eat a lot.

9
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,166
Okay.

10
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,250
Thank you, my dear daughter.

11
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,166
Sure.

12
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:42,875
Good morning.

13
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,166
I’m so damn nervous!

14
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,333
Will anyone see us?

15
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,291
Don't worry.

16
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,416
I've been here for a while.
I haven't seen anyone pass by.

17
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,791
-Shit!
-What?

18
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,916
You scared me!

19
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,041
What the heck?

20
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:52,916
There might be cameras.

21
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:04,833
Palm.

22
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,166
Palm!

23
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,666
There he is. Go.

24
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,166
Can't you get any closer?

25
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,791
Your dad won't disappear.

26
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,708
Chonburi is straight ahead.

27
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,166
Sit back. You're blocking my view.

28
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,333
Palm.

29
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,958
If I catch him, what should I say?

30
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,208
Don't tell people off just yet.

31
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,958
It might really be about work.

32
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:34,916
"Shameless!

33
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,375
You already know he has a family,
and yet you still mess with him."

34
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,416
Or should I tell her off coldly?

35
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,208
"Slut."

36
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,750
Let's go ask him.

37
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,500
Hold it, Palm.

38
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,833
Hold on, I was joking!

39
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,708
-Sir, Gink has a question for you!
-Palm! Damn you!

40
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,791
-Sir!
-Palm!

41
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:57,916
Gink has a question.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,958
Sir!

43
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,125
Sir!

44
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,541
Hey...

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,041
Are you okay?

46
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:09,791
I'm fine.

47
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,166
I've got an iron dick.

48
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,166
Disgusting.

49
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,875
Why is he turning left?

50
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,833
-Follow him!
-Okay.

51
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,000
-Palm!
-Sorry!

52
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,041
You...

53
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,916
Is he flying to Chonburi?

54
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,791
How will we know where he's flying to?

55
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,291
I've checked the flight schedule.

56
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,916
Morning flights are only to Chiangmai.

57
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,291
His factory doesn't have a branch there.

58
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,041
He might have some business there.

59
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,541
Let it go.

60
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,708
Palm.

61
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,166
Lend me some money.

62
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,833
Here. I'll pay you later.

63
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,208
Isn't that too much?

64
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,416
Are you taking first class?

65
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,666
I’m buying you a ticket too.

66
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:37,958
What?

67
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,291
Gink!

68
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,583
I'm going in.

69
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,166
Not yet! Calm down.

70
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,375
He's probably here for business.

71
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,583
Who knows who's in there?

72
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,458
Let's go downstairs.

73
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,583
Okay?

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,833
Gink.

75
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,333
Gink, don't go there.

76
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,708
It's too high.

77
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,541
I can't hear a thing.

78
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,708
The walls are too thick.

79
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,041
They say you can hear better
through an outlet.

80
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,333
Do you hear anything?

81
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,708
It's really thick.

82
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,458
Let's go.

83
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,166
We'll be in trouble if someone comes in.

84
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,583
Let me try.

85
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,791
I said you can't hear anything.
Why are you insisting?

86
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,000
If there's really nothing, then move.

87
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,416
Is it really that bad?

88
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,041
Let's go.

89
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,666
Gink. Where are you going?

90
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,083
Ladies and gentlemen,

91
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:33,291
we're arriving at Suvarnabhumi Airport.

92
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,916
I think I'll tell my mom.

93
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,791
Okay.

94
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,291
And they'll probably get a divorce.

95
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,916
When my parents got divorced,

96
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,041
I cried for a week.

97
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,125
But believe me,

98
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,250
it will get better.

99
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,625
It might even be better
than them being together.

100
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:32,875
You know...

101
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,833
my dad's really busy with work.

102
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,208
But he still finds time
to drive me to school every morning.

103
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,041
Because he doesn't want Mom to get tired.

104
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,833
I've always thought he loved
me and Mom so much.

105
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,916
Now, I'm not sure
if he really does love us.

106
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,916
I don't know who does or doesn't love you.

107
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,166
But I love you, Gink.

108
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,250
It's okay.

109
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,708
I'll stay with you for now.

110
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,291
Palm.

111
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,250
Can I ask you something?

112
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,166
I won't ask it again.

113
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,958
When you said you love me,

114
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,291
what kind of love is it?

115
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,041
Answer me first.

116
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,416
I really love you, Gink.

117
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,208
You're my only friend
who I can truly talk to.

118
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,166
Being friends means

119
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,250
not worrying about each other.

120
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,041
Not being possessive.

121
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,416
Not fighting. Not indulging every whim.

122
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,208
Yes.

123
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,666
And the best part is...

124
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,875
friends don't break up.

125
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,125
Fine.

126
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,250
Don't cheer me up with quotes
from Facebook.

127
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,166
-Gink.
-Let me gather my thoughts.

128
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,250
Excuse me, please sit down.

129
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,708
Hey! Watch out!

130
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,083
I'm sorry.

131
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,791
Good job! Try again.

132
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,708
"Good job! Try again."

133
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,625
Hey!

134
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,875
"Hey!"

135
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,625
-Why are you copying me?
-"Why are you copying me?"

136
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,375
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck?

137
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,875
"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck?"

138
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,708
-Sally sold seashells at the seashore.
-"Sally sold seashells at the seashore."

139
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,208
There.

140
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,541
Jerk. Who the hell can repeat that?

141
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Damn you.

142
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,041
You're so mean.

143
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,375
You're the mean one.

144
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,083
You don't even talk to me
and still have Piyachart sit next to me.

145
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,958
His feet stink.

146
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,250
I don't get what he's saying.

147
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,541
I miss your nagging.

148
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,166
Fine.

149
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,166
I'll move back tomorrow.

150
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,791
Wait. Are you going to use me
to do something?

151
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,458
I'm seeing Louis.

152
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,500
Damn.

153
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,166
What did he do to get you to give in?

154
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,250
It's a secret.

155
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,916
Whatever.

156
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,000
You have a boy now,
so you're keeping secrets from me.

157
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,166
Whatever.

158
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,583
Being friends is good enough, right?

159
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,083
All right.

160
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,083
I have to go.

161
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,083
Yes. Bye.

162
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,541
Let's go.

163
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,250
-I got new chords.
-Really?

164
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,541
Louis!

165
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,125
"Being friends is good enough."

166
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,833
When I heard this sentence,

167
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,375
I don't know why it hurt.

168
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,208
That was a tell-tale sign

169
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,666
that I was jealous.

170
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,791
But I was the one
who told her to be just friends.

171
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,666
Which one?

172
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:22,833
The one over there.

173
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,833
The one singing on stage.

174
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,750
What now?

175
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:31,875
Overall you're so charming

176
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,958
Don't be shy, I'm telling the truth

177
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,625
She's really charming.

178
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:45,000
Can you get any cuter?
I want to be next to you

179
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,083
I know how you feel.

180
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,333
Mine is also here.

181
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,666
And she's dancing
with her boyfriend right now.

182
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,750
We've been best friends for ages.

183
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,541
But...

184
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,791
she's clueless.

185
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,000
Like the movie Dear Dakanda?

186
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,000
Not really!

187
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,375
The guy,

188
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,416
when Dakanda turned him down,

189
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:12,791
he manned up,

190
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:13,791
went to the sea,

191
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,750
and got a new girlfriend.

192
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,083
But I don't have the balls!

193
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,291
When I was turned down,

194
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,208
I didn't even dare to leave.

195
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,083
-I understand.
-I know how you feel.

196
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,458
Mine's also the same.

197
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,416
She can't forget her ex.

198
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,833
So she told me to wait as her friend.

199
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,750
Just like a dog

200
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,166
who can only love one owner.

201
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,708
-I understand.
-Thanks a lot.

202
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,333
My friend...

203
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,875
is not ready for a relationship.

204
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,791
She wanted to graduate first.

205
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,791
Has she graduated yet?

206
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,250
She just applied for a second masters.

207
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,000
She's planning to get a Ph.D. too.

208
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,083
I've found my friends!

209
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,916
-We've fallen hard for them.
-Yes!

210
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,958
-But they just want to be friends.
-Damn!

211
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,958
And we give in!

212
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,541
-Yes!
-Yes!

213
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,041
To the friend zone!

214
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,625
One year.

215
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,708
Three years already.

216
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,666
Mine's five years.

217
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:33,958
Ten years!

218
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,541
Wait a second.

219
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
That's a decade?

220
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,041
You've been waiting for ten years?

221
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,375
I wasn't really waiting.

222
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,458
Pang.

223
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,083
I'm sorry.

224
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,291
Sorry for what?

225
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,791
Never mind. Let's just say I'm sorry.

226
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,791
I'm really sorry.

227
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,500
If you're going to disappear like that,

228
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,666
then just get lost!

229
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:10,916
Hold on, Pang.

230
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,541
Palm!

231
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,875
Is this how you talk to a freshman?

232
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,666
Just go be with her!

233
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,833
Wait!

234
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,625
Let's finally be over and done with.

235
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,083
Well, I'm...

236
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,875
I'm going to tell you something.

237
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:41,875
Someone like you

238
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,583
will never find true love.

239
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,458
Damn you!

240
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,291
Don't all those years mean anything?

241
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,500
-Of course.
-What, then?

242
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,666
Good memories in Savanna Park.

243
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,625
Our picture was here.

244
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,166
And they did it right here!

245
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,416
This is not mine.

246
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,291
Are you really my friend?

247
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:26,791
I'm not sleeping with you.

248
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,208
How am I supposed to know?

249
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,166
Go sit down.

250
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,208
I'll get them myself.

251
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:42,708
And Gink will get through it

252
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,958
She'll have a change of heart

253
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:55,666
And Louis will fade away

254
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,125
Even if that table's still there

255
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,458
Even if it hasn't gone anywhere

256
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:09,166
I'll throw it out for you

257
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,291
Gink, you know,

258
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:24,000
men are nice to us in the beginning.

259
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,541
They'll be by our side, taking care of us.

260
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,083
But in the end, they will be unfaithful.

261
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,666
You can't trust men!

262
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,833
Trust me.

263
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,375
I've seen a lot.

264
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,458
I've been through it all.

265
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,416
Don't bother with love.

266
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,333
Parn.

267
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,416
My friend is just your manager.

268
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,750
Does she have to join
your Spinster Club too?

269
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,125
Damn you, Palm.

270
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,083
You're the one who sang the lyrics,

271
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,833
"Loneliness are opposite poles.

272
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,708
Young people should find love," right?

273
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,041
I didn't sing that line.

274
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,750
I was just in the chorus then.

275
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,708
Gink, turn the song on.

276
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,750
I'm ready. I'm feeling it.

277
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,583
I agree with you.

278
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,458
I don't want to be in love again.

279
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:04,833
I'm done.

280
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,500
What?

281
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,583
Are you really done with love?

282
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,375
I was just trying to side with Parn.

283
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,916
Actually, I still believe
there is a good guy out there for me.

284
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,291
Sneaky bastard.

285
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:46,416
Hey.

286
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
If she's flirting like that,

287
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,208
-then it's time to seal the deal.
-Right.

288
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:50,916
She didn't mean me.

289
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,875
-What?
-What?

290
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,458
Sorry!

291
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,833
It's all over.

292
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:01,125
If you still love me, care about me

293
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:04,625
And don't want to hurt me

294
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:08,583
Please don't leave me hanging

295
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:14,750
If I'm not good enough for your love
Give me a chance to show it

296
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,000
Please don't hurt me

297
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,416
Ted!

298
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,166
Ted!

299
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,333
He's cool, isn't he?

300
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,166
Too cool.

301
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,958
Let me have my moment!

302
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,375
I moved in with him.

303
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:35,291
Really?

304
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,708
Because you’re his manager

305
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,666
and it'll make the commute easier, right?

306
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,708
No. I want to hook up
whenever I want, okay?

307
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,541
Good. Don't bring too much stuff.

308
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,416
Goong-Gink.

309
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:51,541
Goong-Gink.

310
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,541
Goong-Gink.

311
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,166
Goong-Gink.

312
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,708
No, I'm not going to sing.

313
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,541
-I don't know any of your friends here.
-Just one duet.

314
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,041
No. Take Palm, then.

315
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,458
Isn't the host his friend?

316
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:02,750
But it's a New and Jiew song.

317
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,166
-Which song?
-Come on.

318
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,750
Just go. I'll film you.

319
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,625
Stop it. You just want to film the singer.

320
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,375
She's my friend. Do you want her number?

321
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,458
Don't give it to him.

322
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,583
He can't even remember
all his girls' names.

323
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,750
But I can remember their faces.

324
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,416
You're my idol.

325
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,041
-Ted.
-What?

326
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,083
-Hey.
-Listen.

327
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,583
Don't be like him, okay?

328
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,708
Yes, ma'am.

329
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,375
Don't even try.

330
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:25,625
Roger that, Goong-Gink.

331
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:26,958
I won't.

332
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,875
Goong-Gink, just one duet
with my friend. She's waiting.

333
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:31,791
No.

334
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,833
Stop it with the "Goong-Gink"!

335
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,750
Palm. Fill this up.

336
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,166
I'll be back.

337
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:46,750
Just one duet.

338
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,041
I'll fill it to the rim.

339
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:01,875
A refill again?

340
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,791
I've seen you here twice.

341
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:08,958
Are these two mugs for you?

342
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,000
No.

343
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,875
The other one is for my friend.

344
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,166
I see.

345
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:17,250
Same here.

346
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,416
I wonder why they don't do it themselves?

347
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,416
That's a good question.

348
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,333
My friend is dancing with her boyfriend.

349
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:30,500
You're a good friend.

350
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,208
Maybe too good?

351
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,708
Being nice is painful.

352
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,416
You're really hurt. Look at your face.

353
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,916
I...

354
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:41,416
I...

355
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,291
Don't tell me

356
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,291
you're also a good friend.

357
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,458
We've got a lot to talk about.

358
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:54,791
Excuse me.

359
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,750
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

360
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,083
Are those for a friend?

361
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,791
They're both mine.

362
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,708
Such a heavy drinker.

363
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,166
I suppose.

364
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,958
I was first. Sorry.

365
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:24,583
If you don't love me
Then don't be nice to me

366
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,041
If you don't love me
Then don't care for me

367
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,625
If there isn't any love
Then don't do anything

368
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:35,166
Because my heart is weak

369
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,125
If you don't love me
Then don't call to check up on me

370
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:42,375
Because the sound of your voice is painful

371
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:46,166
-Can you please stop?
-Can you please stop?

372
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:52,958
-If there isn't any love, just let me go
-If there isn't any love, just let me go

373
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:57,291
-Can you please stop?
-Can you please stop?

374
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:04,708
-If there isn't any love, just let me go
-If there isn't any love, just let me go

375
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,458
-Shit!
-Shit!

376
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,916
-Gink!
-Goong-Gink!

377
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,041
Don't move. Stay still.

378
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,041
Don't move yet.

379
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:14,333
Are you hurt?

380
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:16,416
Shit!

381
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:23,750
Does it hurt a lot?

382
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,541
I'm okay.

383
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,708
You'll be dancing again in no time.

384
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,291
Only one person is allowed.

385
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:45,041
Palm.

386
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,875
Go enjoy your beer.

387
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,166
Don't worry about me.

388
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:53,541
Ted?

389
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,250
I'll keep you posted.

390
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:08,416
I know there's a thin line
between friend and boyfriend.

391
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,375
It's very uncomfortable,

392
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,333
being in this friend zone.

393
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:27,666
It's like we're close,

394
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,416
but in reality,

395
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:30,958
we're freaking far.

396
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,041
I understand you.

397
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:37,083
They talk to us on the phone for hours.

398
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:41,041
But they only talk about other guys.

399
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,000
Yes.

400
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,958
They say they feel comfortable around us.

401
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:46,166
But when they go on trips,

402
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:48,708
they go with their boyfriends.

403
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:49,750
-Exactly!
-Exactly!

404
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,000
Tell us they love us every day.

405
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:53,458
Say they miss us every night.

406
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,000
But they never choose us!

407
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,041
-Right!
-Right!

408
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,416
The friend zone is
just another kind of prison!

409
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,500
How can you tolerate it for ten years?

410
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,041
Right. I shouldn't!

411
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,375
I've crossed the damn line!

412
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,333
-Cross the damn line!
-Yes!

413
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,333
We don’t want to be just friends.
We want to be hubbies!

414
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:14,166
Wait, hold on.

415
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,833
You've already crossed the line?

416
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:27,666
Love never changes

417
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,416
When the opportunity is there,

418
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:31,708
you have to take the risk.

419
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:04,916
-Are you making that up?
-It's up to you if you don't believe me.

420
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,500
What did you wish for? I heard my name.

421
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:12,958
What?

422
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:14,750
What did you wish for?

423
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,375
Wait a second.

424
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,791
Hello, klutz.

425
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,208
Have you taken off your cast?

426
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,291
Palm.

427
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:32,333
I've been puking.

428
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:33,708
And my period hasn't come yet.

429
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,875
-I might be pregnant.
-What?

430
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:41,458
Where are you?

431
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:42,541
I'm in Malaysia.

432
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:43,458
What?

433
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,791
Oh, sorry.

434
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,291
What are you doing there?

435
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:49,041
Where are you?

436
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:50,583
Myanmar.

437
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:52,791
Where's Ted?

438
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,125
I came alone.

439
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,583
Can you come see me?

440
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:58,791
I'm not just down the road.

441
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,208
I don't know what to do next.

442
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:03,833
Calm down.

443
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,666
I'll call you back.

444
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,375
Palm, can you tell me now?

445
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:08,458
What did you wish for?

446
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,458
I wish to leave.

447
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,083
Gink.

448
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,500
You really came!

449
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:03,708
I think it's just a food baby,
you're not pregnant.

450
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,208
What food baby?

451
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:07,416
I couldn't eat anything.

452
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:12,833
I bought a pregnancy test.

453
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,125
But I haven't used it yet.

454
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,416
I've been waiting for you.

455
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:21,833
Where is it?

456
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,083
Where did it go?

457
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,041
Gink.

458
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,208
Get it together.

459
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:29,416
It's in your hand.

460
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:33,708
I'm...

461
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,291
going to do it now.

462
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,583
Have you told Ted yet?

463
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,333
I've only told you.

464
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,083
I can't pee.

465
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,125
Try to force it out.

466
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,125
Man, it won't come out.

467
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,166
I'll help you.

468
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:31,750
Why are you holding it in?

469
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,750
I'm not. I'm forcing it out!

470
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,083
What does it mean?

471
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,041
I'm not pregnant!

472
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:56,583
I told you it's a food baby.

473
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,041
Why did you puke?

474
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,583
I must be...

475
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:09,708
stressed out.

476
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:11,541
Did you have a fight with Ted?

477
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,291
Well,

478
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:19,625
we're working on a jingle for King Power.

479
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,541
It's Palmy's song.

480
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,250
It has to be sung in different languages.

481
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,333
We've got to record singers
from different countries.

482
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:29,916
I hurt my leg, so I couldn't go with him.

483
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,041
He had to fly alone to Laos.

484
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:35,000
Can you please tell me?

485
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:39,583
Is this real or am I overthinking?

486
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:42,625
I'm starting to get anxious

487
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,791
With an unanswered question

488
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,916
Tell me what's in your heart

489
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,500
I want to know what you're thinking

490
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,083
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

491
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,583
Let's go eat.

492
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:56,958
I see. Okay.

493
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:00,791
Do you want to see my tears?

494
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,291
And he went to Vietnam.

495
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:05,125
I want to tell you

496
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:08,833
How anxious I am

497
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,041
Before you say anything

498
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,916
I want you to promise me

499
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,500
That you won't let me down

500
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,166
Then the Philippines.

501
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,500
Is our love still as good as before?

502
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,291
Are we still together in our dreams?

503
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:26,875
Your heart hasn't changed

504
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,833
And our love is still the same

505
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,041
And then to Malaysia.

506
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:34,583
All I want is for you to say it

507
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:38,416
Tell me that you think about it

508
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:41,958
Tell me, so I can be sure

509
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,541
That our love is still the same

510
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,583
Am I right?

511
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:48,541
The singers

512
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:49,958
are all young and pretty too.

513
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,666
Ted is such a good guy

514
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,583
and I trust him.

515
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:54,125
I'm not being a baby.

516
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,416
Stop bragging. Get to the point.

517
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,000
Get up. Come closer.

518
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:01,875
When he was done in Malaysia,

519
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,250
he flew to Indonesia.

520
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,958
I met up with him there.

521
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,458
Why did you go this time?

522
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,125
Well, I missed him.

523
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,916
Stop interrupting me.

524
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,375
When I went to Indonesia,
guess what happened.

525
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:18,708
These headphones aren't good.

526
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,166
Gink.

527
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:22,750
Could you please get my new ones?

528
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:23,958
They're in my bag.

529
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,291
He bought new ones again?

530
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,291
How many ears does he have?

531
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,125
It's in the navy blue box.

532
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,666
-This one?
-Yes.

533
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:47,916
What is this for?

534
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:48,958
For love.

535
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,250
I was totally surprised.

536
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:54,291
He bought us the same watches.

537
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,000
Even though it wasn't my birthday,

538
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,250
our anniversary,
or any other important day.

539
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:03,416
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

540
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:06,291
It's like he's guilty of something,
and he's covering up.

541
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,000
So...

542
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,708
I checked on a little something.

543
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:15,125
Before saying anything else

544
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,916
I want you to promise me

545
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:21,125
That you won't let me down

546
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,666
You should go inside to talk to them.

547
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,458
So, it's clearer.

548
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,250
Okay.

549
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,708
Good idea.

550
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,000
So smart.

551
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:47,250
I peeked at his phone.

552
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,250
But there wasn't anything strange.

553
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,625
I went through his wallet.

554
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,833
Do you want to know what I found?

555
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,708
A restaurant receipt from Malaysia.

556
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,458
I thought you found a bra.

557
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:11,166
You flew here because of a receipt?

558
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:12,166
Are you a millionaire?

559
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,916
My money, my business.

560
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,375
Read what he ordered!

561
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:21,375
"Hamburger. Beer."

562
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:22,458
So?

563
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:23,625
Those were what he ate.

564
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:24,916
Keep reading.

565
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:44,125
Who do you think Ted came with?

566
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,583
The singer, I think.

567
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,625
She's cuter than me too.

568
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:51,833
Check this out.

569
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,125
Let me see. Who's cuter than you?

570
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,416
You're right.

571
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:43,416
Because I'll see her come.

572
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,333
Now, I'm confused about who came or not.

573
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:59,208
I think she came, but they can't remember.

574
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:02,291
They might have come for dinner
and parted after that.

575
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,208
Just trust him.

576
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,416
Then why does Ted have to feel guilty?

577
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,333
Hey.

578
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:09,000
These dim lights.

579
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:10,625
These ballads.

580
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:12,583
With a girl staring into his eyes,

581
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,291
wouldn't sparks start flying?

582
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,666
I don't know.

583
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,458
I'm not Ted.

584
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:51,000
Sorry. Let me get this.

585
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:56,000
Hello, Goong-Gink?

586
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,916
I'm going back now.

587
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:02,666
Don't go to sleep just yet.

588
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,375
I'll get home and talk
with my honey Goong-Gink all night.

589
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,541
Wait for me.

590
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:11,291
Okay. Yes. I see.

591
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:14,500
I'm sorry, Joyce.

592
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:17,208
My girlfriend is waiting for me.
I have to go.

593
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,375
Really?

594
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,875
But I'm still having a good time.

595
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:29,041
Can't you stay a bit longer?

596
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:32,708
Please?

597
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,625
Pretty please?

598
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:35,875
Let's not do that.

599
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,833
I already have a girlfriend.

600
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:40,666
Although she's got a flat rack,
they're natural.

601
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,708
I like them.

602
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,625
Ted.

603
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,083
Is your beard too thin?

604
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:46,791
Let me fill it in.

605
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,291
Hey, don't play with food.

606
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:49,791
And you can?

607
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,458
Palm.

608
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:54,708
It's messy.

609
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:09,791
It's the last step.

610
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:11,916
Very good.

611
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,333
Do you want a piggyback?

612
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,666
No. I'll break your back.

613
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,666
Leave me here.

614
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:26,583
What's your plan?

615
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,666
Actually, I told Ted that

616
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,083
I have a checkup in Bangkok.

617
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,833
I'll meet up with him later.

618
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:35,833
Where are you flying to?

619
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:38,083
Ted's in Cambodia.

620
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:41,750
Don't get ballsy.

621
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:43,666
Look at yourself.

622
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,166
Okay.

623
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:54,833
Thank you so much.

624
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:59,166
I don't know where I'd get
another best friend like you.

625
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:03,708
I'm glad you know it.

626
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,375
Gink?

627
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,583
What are you doing?

628
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,791
I'm afraid it'll be a long wait.

629
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:52,083
I'm keeping you company.

630
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,125
Hey! Hold on. Don't go just yet.

631
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:58,083
Stay.

632
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:02,083
You're really something.

633
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:07,208
This was pointless.

634
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,666
So...

635
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,333
let me know if you get back safe.

636
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:19,000
Are we still together in our dreams?

637
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:22,625
Your heart hasn't changed

638
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:26,541
And our love is still the same

639
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,083
Am I right?

640
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,666
Gink.

641
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,083
Is the backing track ready?

642
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,791
One moment.

643
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,666
Tell me, so I am sure

644
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:02,833
That our love is still the same

645
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:05,000
Am I right?

646
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,208
It's beautiful!

647
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:08,708
Shit!

648
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:11,916
Oh, my god!

649
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:41,791
Goong-Gink.

650
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,916
You don't have to cancel.

651
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:46,875
Give me 15 minutes.

652
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:04,541
I want to tell you

653
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:08,666
How anxious I am

654
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:10,500
Before you say anything

655
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:12,583
I want you to promise me

656
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:15,625
That you won't let me down

657
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:19,333
Is our love still as good as before?

658
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:23,250
Are we still together in our dreams?

659
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:26,916
Your heart hasn't changed

660
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:29,166
You can yell at me.

661
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:32,166
My heart can't.

662
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Do you have any extra pajamas?

663
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,250
I forgot mine.

664
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,416
THREE PIECES

665
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,875
Thank you. Have a good day.

666
00:48:58,333 --> 00:48:59,916
Choose the next trip for us.

667
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:05,875
Can it wait?

668
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:07,750
I don't want to go anywhere for a while.

669
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,291
Okay.

670
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:15,875
Aui.

671
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,500
I'm sorry.

672
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,333
I've been flying a lot.

673
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:21,375
I want to rest at home.

674
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,000
You really like staying at home?

675
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:25,625
When we were in Myanmar, you left early.

676
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,833
You used to fly six times
and we still went out afterward.

677
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,333
Fine.

678
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:33,916
Let's go.

679
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,583
When will you be free?

680
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,208
If you don't want to go, then don't.

681
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,458
Do you want me to drop you off?

682
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:44,416
Let me know the next time
you want to come.

683
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:10,208
Yes?

684
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,291
Where are you?

685
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,000
I'm home. What's up?

686
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:14,583
Look down here.

687
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:16,333
I'm in front of your house!

688
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:26,041
Think about it.

689
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:27,416
Ted's alone in Cambodia,

690
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,791
why would he buy condoms?

691
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:30,375
Just in case.

692
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:32,166
But he used one!

693
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:36,625
Have you asked him yet?

694
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:38,875
He'll come up with excuses.

695
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:40,583
I think it's probably
one of those singers.

696
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,375
I'm going to see for myself.

697
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,125
What?

698
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,125
Gink.

699
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:47,750
Have you lost your mind?

700
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:49,791
Are you trying to be Detective Conan?

701
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,208
There's only one truth.

702
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,250
You can go now.

703
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,875
Bye.

704
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:05,583
Don't worry about me.

705
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,041
May I assist you?

706
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:29,958
Thank you so much.

707
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,166
Without you, I'd be so helpless.

708
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:41,333
My pleasure.

709
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,666
You're so manly.

710
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,625
Excuse me.

711
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:59,041
You know whenever I fly,
I always think of you.

712
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:01,625
I've always wanted to see you at work.

713
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,166
-Palm.
-What?

714
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,000
You have an employee discount
for flights, right?

715
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:07,958
Yes.

716
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,416
Is there any discount for your friends?

717
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:12,958
Only tickets for moms.

718
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:13,958
Maternal mom?

719
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,166
The mom of my child.

720
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,708
Interested?

721
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:20,666
It's good to be you.

722
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,583
There's nothing to be stressed about.

723
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:24,791
Says who?

724
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,125
When you didn't repay me
for the Chiang Mai tickets,

725
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:28,125
I was stressed.

726
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:29,750
I couldn't go out on any dates.

727
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,833
Why didn't you ask me for it?

728
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:35,916
You weren't even talking to me.

729
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:37,583
My date had to treat me.

730
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:38,958
So damn embarrassing.

731
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:42,416
Give me your hand.

732
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,250
The other one.

733
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,833
Hong Kong's an hour early.

734
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:07,791
Who asked?

735
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:38,916
Palm.

736
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,083
The manager is outside.

737
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,375
They're almost finished.

738
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:50,583
Shit!

739
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:52,166
Ted's video calling!

740
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,083
What should I do?

741
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:55,125
Don't answer it.

742
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,208
I can't.

743
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:00,541
I want to see who he is with.

744
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,833
Hello.

745
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:04,333
Hello, Goong-Gink.

746
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:06,708
Where are you?

747
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:07,750
Well...

748
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,083
Hold on, Ted.

749
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:11,750
Damn.

750
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,333
Where am I?

751
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:16,208
Where they sell

752
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:17,416
dumplings and steamed buns.

753
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,125
Gold shops.

754
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,458
I'm in Chinatown.

755
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,208
I just got my cast off
and stopped by to eat.

756
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:27,958
I see.

757
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:31,333
Dumplings and steamed buns.

758
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:34,291
Dim sum.

759
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,125
Har gow and beef balls.

760
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,666
Do you want anything else?

761
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,625
Do you have fried taro?

762
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:47,041
This is a steamed dish cart,
not a fried dish cart.

763
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:49,500
The fried dish cart just passed by,
why didn't you order?

764
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:51,916
What about gyoza? It's the best.

765
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:53,666
Bring whatever you have.

766
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:54,708
Shithead.

767
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,666
Hey!

768
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:58,750
-Oh, hey!
-That hungry? Don't bite him, okay?

769
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:00,000
Sorry, Ted.

770
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,458
I'm starving.

771
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:02,833
So...

772
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:05,375
how's the recording session? Are you done?

773
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:06,333
I'm done.

774
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,666
The singer is fabulous.

775
00:55:09,583 --> 00:55:11,416
Are you still with her?

776
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:12,791
Do you want to talk to her?

777
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:52,708
Are you going home after dinner?

778
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:55,416
Yes. How about you?

779
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,666
Are you going anywhere else?

780
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:59,416
I'm going straight to the hotel and sleep.

781
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,750
I'm so exhausted.

782
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,125
Okay. I won't bother you.

783
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,583
Enjoy your dinner.

784
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:05,500
See you.

785
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,291
I miss you.

786
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,458
Satisfied?

787
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:46,708
Gink.

788
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:47,750
The singer's here.

789
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:53,250
Who is he talking to?

790
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:06,541
Gink. She's looking at us.

791
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:07,500
Palm.

792
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:11,833
Gink.

793
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,708
There's a girl in the car.

794
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,041
Wait for me!

795
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:29,833
Gink.

796
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,250
Calm down.

797
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:35,291
Do you know where to find him?

798
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:36,541
I'll wait for him at the hotel.

799
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:41,333
Intercon.

800
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:47,958
People have generic faces.

801
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:04,375
She said that Ted isn't back yet.

802
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:05,875
Okay.

803
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:16,166
Why did you order a lot?

804
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:17,666
This is yours. This is mine.

805
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:20,166
The rest are for throwing at him
if he brings her here.

806
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,916
Damn! Are you going to stab him?

807
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,666
It's for cutting off my cast.

808
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,333
I told Ted I took it off.
It won't look real.

809
00:58:28,416 --> 00:58:30,958
But you told him you're in Chinatown.

810
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:32,291
Well, I wanted to surprise him.

811
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:33,500
Hurry up and cut it.

812
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:45,750
What?

813
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,125
You've lost it.

814
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:49,750
Can't you see?

815
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:52,333
Why are you so obsessed with him?

816
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
You know I don't want to get married.

817
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,541
Yes, I know.

818
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:02,083
But I want to marry him
as soon as possible.

819
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,083
You know...

820
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:06,500
every song I listen to
makes me think of him.

821
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:08,666
I was never like this with Louis.

822
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:11,250
You're infatuated.

823
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:12,708
Palm.

824
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:14,166
I'm obsessed!

825
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:17,250
When I heard him talk about our future,

826
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:19,750
I just want to time travel to that moment.

827
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:23,041
He said he wants to have three kids.

828
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:24,500
So he can form a band.

829
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:26,291
The firstborn will play the piano.

830
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:28,125
The second will play the violin.

831
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:29,291
You're daydreaming.

832
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,541
That's what everyone says before marriage.

833
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:33,375
But who knows if it'll turn out like that?

834
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,541
Actually, marriage is a good thing.

835
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:37,916
Mom told me,

836
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:41,666
if he strays,
I can sue both him and the mistress.

837
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:44,000
You say it as if money
can get rid of your sorrow.

838
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:48,333
Fine. You just go on
being the player you are.

839
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:54,208
Who said I don't want to get married?

840
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:57,375
In your case,

841
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:59,000
marriage will make you go broke!

842
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:01,208
Yes.

843
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,750
Stop being nosy
if you want to get married.

844
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:04,666
You'll get divorced.

845
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:05,583
What do you mean?

846
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:07,666
I'm not supposed to know what he has done?

847
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,166
I'm sick of this.

848
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,333
You didn't do anything wrong.
What are you sick of?

849
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:12,416
Your foot!

850
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:13,833
It's so damn stinky.

851
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:15,708
That's enough.

852
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:16,916
Don't start with me.

853
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,166
We're not getting married.

854
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:21,375
Go wait for your groom.

855
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:34,375
Where is Ted?

856
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:36,958
Why isn't he answering?

857
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,750
He said he's coming back to the hotel.

858
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:56,041
Has it been too long?

859
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:57,625
Should I report it to the police?

860
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,041
He's been with the girl
for a couple of hours.

861
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,541
The police won't take the report.

862
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,083
Go hide.

863
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:19,291
Palm, I can’t look.

864
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,000
They're getting out.

865
01:01:24,083 --> 01:01:25,666
It's Ted, right? Is it Ted?

866
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:40,333
I think he must be
in some kind of accident.

867
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:41,625
Should I call the police?

868
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:43,708
At least we'll know what happened.

869
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:55,125
You should try calling
with a different number.

870
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:10,541
Hello.

871
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:16,416
Can you hear me?

872
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:27,666
Let's go.

873
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,041
Maybe...

874
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,500
the woman in the taxi is Ted's friend.

875
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,458
They might have dinner plans.

876
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:10,791
Then they will go their separate ways.

877
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:18,208
Ted might...

878
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:21,875
be drunk and couldn't get to the hotel.

879
01:03:21,958 --> 01:03:22,875
So, he...

880
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:25,958
went to a hostel nearby
to spend the night.

881
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:27,708
That's why he didn't answer your calls.

882
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:32,708
And...

883
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:34,875
Ted...

884
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:36,541
Well...

885
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:37,708
he had to take a piss.

886
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:40,125
So, he got up to take a piss,

887
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:43,958
which was the same time
you used my number to call him.

888
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:46,791
What am I doing here?

889
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:47,708
What?

890
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:51,458
What am I doing here?

891
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:52,375
Shit!

892
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:54,833
What am I doing here?

893
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:56,166
Gink!

894
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,333
What am I doing here?

895
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,916
You're being noisy!

896
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:04,916
Stop!

897
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
My friend's in danger.

898
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:08,500
She jumped on the sign.

899
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:09,541
Look outside.

900
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:24,875
Move back.

901
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,833
Please back up.

902
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:29,750
Go back.

903
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:36,208
Gink!

904
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:38,208
Gink.

905
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:40,666
Hold on.

906
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:41,958
Hold on tight.

907
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,583
Gink. I'm coming.

908
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:47,166
Gink!

909
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,125
I'm here to help you.

910
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:51,541
I shouldn't have come!

911
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:53,750
I shouldn't have found out!

912
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,875
Look at me, Gink.

913
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,083
I'm right here.

914
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:02,958
I'm here for you.

915
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:25,000
Good girl.

916
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,583
You're my good girl.

917
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:13,958
I'm not your friend, fatso!

918
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:25,958
Gink.

919
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,958
Don't ever do that again.

920
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:33,416
If you fall, you could die.

921
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,041
Come on.

922
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,625
Let's go home.

923
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:47,708
I don't want to go home yet.

924
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:51,958
Are you working tomorrow?

925
01:06:53,625 --> 01:06:54,458
Of course.

926
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:56,083
I'll fly back in the morning.

927
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:57,166
I can't take a leave either.

928
01:06:58,333 --> 01:06:59,833
I don't want to be alone.

929
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:20,791
For your safety,
please keep your seat belt secure

930
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,458
until the airplane has come to a full stop

931
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:23,958
and the seat belt sign has turned off.

932
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,958
When opening the overhead bins,

933
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:29,416
please be mindful of any items
that may fall on you or other passengers.

934
01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:32,541
You can pick up your baggage at belt one.

935
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:49,208
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

936
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,333
Thank you.

937
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:55,791
Thank you. Have a fun trip.

938
01:07:57,458 --> 01:07:59,041
Can't you go with me now?

939
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,791
I have another flight
and I'll rush back to see you.

940
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,666
Thanks a lot.

941
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,750
Thank you.

942
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:12,958
Palm!

943
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:15,458
Why didn't you tell us
your friend was flying?

944
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:16,458
Well...

945
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,208
This is Gink.

946
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,916
-Is this your first time in Krabi?
-Oh, we're just friends.

947
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:31,208
Gink!

948
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:35,041
Don't forget to eat.

949
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:53,833
Excuse me.

950
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:28,083
Just like the ad.

951
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:35,083
-Hello.
-Hello.

952
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:01,583
Gink, I'm here.

953
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,416
Damn!

954
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:12,500
Have you been here all this time?

955
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:15,583
Palm.

956
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:18,208
Go buy me more beer and freeze it.

957
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:19,833
I want some beer slushie.

958
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:24,291
That's enough.

959
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:48,791
What the hell are you eating?

960
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:08,958
Come on. Let's go out.

961
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:09,916
No.

962
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:12,166
I'm going to sleep right here.

963
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,333
I'm going to eat, sleep, and repeat.

964
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:15,416
Go get some fresh air.

965
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,708
It'll help.

966
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:18,083
Believe me.

967
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,416
I'm always breaking up with girls.

968
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:21,708
Take a look at me.

969
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:25,000
This is what all the girls
you've dumped look like.

970
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:34,500
I'm a mortician.

971
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,500
You're such a burden.

972
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:41,125
I’m here to avenge your exes.

973
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:43,750
Bring it on.

974
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:46,583
I've never been this worried
about anyone else.

975
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:54,375
Enough.

976
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:56,083
I'm already pretty.

977
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:57,916
Where are you taking me?

978
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,458
You know how to speak Chinese?

979
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:39,291
What did you wish for?

980
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:40,250
I heard my name.

981
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,000
For us to stay together forever.

982
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:43,708
Come on.

983
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,500
You only know one sentence.

984
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,208
It's your cheesy pickup line, right?

985
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:49,500
How about you?

986
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:51,166
Don't you know?

987
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:53,250
If you tell others, it won't come true.

988
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:54,750
How is that?

989
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:57,291
Together forever?
Has it come true for anyone?

990
01:12:58,416 --> 01:12:59,750
Why did you look at me earlier?

991
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:00,958
Did you curse me?

992
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,666
I was wishing for you
to stop being a player.

993
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:05,416
See, I told you.

994
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:06,458
It won't come true.

995
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:11,416
Why do you want me to stop?

996
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:18,541
I feel sorry for all your victims.

997
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,083
Let's go.

998
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:27,166
Have you ever wondered...

999
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:28,833
What if we were an item?

1000
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:32,958
We'd probably be like today.

1001
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:36,958
What?

1002
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:40,833
Well, what do you think?

1003
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:41,916
I'd probably go crazy.

1004
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,583
I'd probably check your phone all day.

1005
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:46,250
Other girls probably text you all day.

1006
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:50,666
Who would dare to cheat?

1007
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:53,166
You hanging off that sign
is stuck in my head.

1008
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:56,791
How can a player stop playing?

1009
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:58,958
How many girls are you talking to?

1010
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,166
"How many"?

1011
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:01,500
I'm talking to no one right now.

1012
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:02,791
Let me see.

1013
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:04,833
Palm reading?

1014
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:11,583
Passcode?

1015
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,583
Are you my girlfriend?
You're checking my phone.

1016
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,083
Don't!

1017
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,375
I'm kidding.

1018
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,666
Stop for a second.

1019
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,375
-What?
-Stop the bike first.

1020
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:06,541
Ted's calling.

1021
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:08,208
Palm! Look ahead!

1022
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,875
Damn it. Sorry. Are you hurt?

1023
01:15:23,166 --> 01:15:24,041
Gink!

1024
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:26,041
Gink!

1025
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:28,500
Gink, come on now!

1026
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:34,625
Hold on tight.

1027
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:35,541
Palm!

1028
01:15:35,625 --> 01:15:37,416
Monkey!

1029
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:38,750
Monkey!

1030
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:43,958
That hurts!

1031
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:54,791
You thought I was the monkey?

1032
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:55,958
There are similarities.

1033
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:57,250
I nearly pissed myself!

1034
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:58,958
Take me to the toilet right now!

1035
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:00,875
Can't you hold it?

1036
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:01,958
We're almost in the city.

1037
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:03,041
I can't!

1038
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,041
Go away, dumbass monkey!

1039
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:23,875
One day, Gink took a piss in the woods

1040
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:27,041
Gink met a little monkey

1041
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,500
-Palm.
-What?

1042
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:32,208
It's poop.

1043
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:34,833
Gosh.

1044
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:36,125
What's wrong with your butthole?

1045
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,416
Do you have any tissues?

1046
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:50,791
Nasty.

1047
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,333
I'll use my panties to wipe it.

1048
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:53,250
What the hell!

1049
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:54,791
Are you crazy?

1050
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:55,750
I'll use the leaves.

1051
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:56,791
Wait. Stop!

1052
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:58,791
Gosh.

1053
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:06,041
Here.

1054
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:08,583
Man, your shirt?

1055
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:09,625
Yes.

1056
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,458
What are you going to wear?

1057
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:12,750
Just wipe it, will you?

1058
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:27,041
Mom, look. A naked dude!

1059
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:42,708
-One hundred baht.
-Here.

1060
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:45,000
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

1061
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:50,750
Hello, Ted.

1062
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:53,916
I'm not going back to work yet.

1063
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:56,000
The doctor told me not to walk so much.

1064
01:17:57,083 --> 01:17:59,333
Are you done mixing the song?

1065
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:03,208
All right.
Send it over, I'll listen to it.

1066
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:07,000
I miss you too.

1067
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:14,041
When are you going to
give your "Ted" talk?

1068
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:17,166
Not right now.

1069
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:19,625
Then when?

1070
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,958
Are you going to keep flying around
with me?

1071
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:24,791
-Are you?
-Here.

1072
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:26,416
Listen.

1073
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:29,166
The Chinese version.

1074
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,708
You like to speak Chinese, right?

1075
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,833
Are you listening to me at all?

1076
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:48,166
I used to like this song a lot.

1077
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,416
It's fun.

1078
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:52,500
But now I really hate it.

1079
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:06,458
Do you like shitting in the woods?

1080
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:09,916
Right?

1081
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:13,416
And jumping onto signs like Jackie Chan

1082
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:17,750
When you fall down, you're a klutz again

1083
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:21,083
I don't want to see you
Going crazy like this

1084
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:24,708
Like this

1085
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:28,416
Can't you just find a good guy for once?

1086
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:32,416
But if you can't, then stay with me

1087
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:36,708
For the time being, can you?

1088
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:42,625
This is a new version.

1089
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,000
The lyrics are really good.

1090
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:45,791
You like it now?

1091
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:55,250
Hold this.

1092
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:08,958
What a feeling!

1093
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:29,958
Let's go drink in my room.

1094
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,416
That'll be 100.

1095
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,583
That'll be 190.

1096
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:17,250
That'll be 100.

1097
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:28,666
That'll be 190.

1098
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:30,708
That'll be 100.

1099
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:33,041
That'll be 190.

1100
01:21:33,916 --> 01:21:34,916
That'll be 190!

1101
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,291
Take it or leave it.

1102
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,375
I'll take it.

1103
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:40,083
Make up your mind.

1104
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:42,666
I'll take it. I'm sorry.

1105
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:04,125
I bought some snacks.

1106
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:05,958
Okay.

1107
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:07,666
Come in.

1108
01:22:44,291 --> 01:22:45,500
I've always wanted to do this.

1109
01:22:45,791 --> 01:22:46,916
Beer spa.

1110
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:51,541
Why don't you...

1111
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:52,958
come and chill with me?

1112
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:56,250
Come on.

1113
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:00,708
Okay.

1114
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:07,750
Oh, shit.

1115
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:09,666
Hold on.

1116
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:11,291
My jeans are stuck.

1117
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:38,250
I thought we were going to drink beer.

1118
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:40,041
Am I supposed to drink it from the tub?

1119
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:52,916
Did you know?

1120
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:54,416
Beer nourishes our hair.

1121
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:56,208
It gets rid of the chemicals.

1122
01:23:56,375 --> 01:23:57,708
You're always styling your hair.

1123
01:23:58,291 --> 01:23:59,125
Turn around.

1124
01:23:59,416 --> 01:24:00,375
I'll wash it.

1125
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:02,916
Okay.

1126
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:09,208
Lay back.

1127
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:10,541
Rest on my legs.

1128
01:24:17,875 --> 01:24:19,250
Is this okay?

1129
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:31,416
Do you like it?

1130
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:02,583
Are you drunk?

1131
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:06,083
I'm not drunk.

1132
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,583
I can't do this.

1133
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:22,000
It's okay.

1134
01:25:22,458 --> 01:25:23,833
I understand.

1135
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:25,791
We've always been friends.

1136
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:27,541
Stuff like this takes time.

1137
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:29,791
Let's take it one step at a time.

1138
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:32,750
Why could he do it, but I can't?

1139
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:46,958
Clear things up with him first.

1140
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,791
Don't use me to get back at him!

1141
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,500
It's too fucked up!

1142
01:25:56,791 --> 01:25:58,166
How about when you flirt with me?

1143
01:25:58,250 --> 01:25:59,375
You think I don't know?

1144
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:01,666
I want you to feel better.

1145
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:03,041
Is that all?

1146
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:05,000
What about that thing in your pocket?

1147
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:09,708
I'm not sure if you see me
as a friend anymore.

1148
01:26:13,416 --> 01:26:14,916
I really want to get up.

1149
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,583
But you know why I can't?

1150
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:18,416
-Why?
-I have a hard-on!

1151
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:20,041
Damn you.

1152
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,750
If we weren't friends,
I'd have my way with you right now.

1153
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:24,416
Stop it.

1154
01:26:24,666 --> 01:26:26,625
If I let you,
there is no way you'd resist.

1155
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:31,750
Let's stop being friends then!

1156
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:33,500
Is this how you want it?

1157
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:34,666
Come back in!

1158
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:35,750
Come in here!

1159
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:37,416
Don't taunt me!

1160
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:45,250
You're so brainless.

1161
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:49,041
If I were Ted, I'd cheat on you too.

1162
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:56,500
Is this how you want it?

1163
01:26:57,666 --> 01:26:58,833
Is this how you want it?

1164
01:27:00,125 --> 01:27:01,000
Then go for it.

1165
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:02,125
Come on.

1166
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:03,458
Do it!

1167
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:09,833
You know I love you...

1168
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:12,750
Is that why you're doing
whatever you want?

1169
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:24,000
Palm.

1170
01:27:28,833 --> 01:27:29,791
Hey.

1171
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:34,041
Palm.

1172
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,916
I'm sorry for taking it out on you.

1173
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:45,083
Before you do anything,
think about it first.

1174
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:50,500
If you don't really feel it,
don't act on it, okay?

1175
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,708
Who said I don’t feel it?

1176
01:28:34,625 --> 01:28:36,083
I'll break up with Ted.

1177
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:02,958
If you don't break up, I'll kiss you.

1178
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:06,458
Sure.

1179
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:14,625
If I do, you have to take me to Europe.

1180
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:16,458
What?

1181
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:19,125
To see the Northern Lights.
Eat caviar. Go to five-star hotels.

1182
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,083
Deal?

1183
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:23,375
What a long list.

1184
01:29:24,166 --> 01:29:25,333
It can be anywhere

1185
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:27,458
as long as I'm with you.

1186
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:34,166
Okay.

1187
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:35,083
Deal.

1188
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:41,666
Gink.

1189
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:43,458
Yes?

1190
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:53,791
After you're done with Ted,

1191
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:55,416
I'll see you at Shwedagon Pagoda.

1192
01:29:56,833 --> 01:29:57,708
Sure.

1193
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:10,541
Before you say anything

1194
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:12,250
I want you to promise me

1195
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:15,166
That you won't let me down

1196
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:18,750
Is our love still as good as before?

1197
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:22,583
Are we still together in our dreams?

1198
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:26,208
Your heart hasn't changed

1199
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:29,875
And our love is still the same

1200
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:31,083
What's wrong?

1201
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:34,166
Nothing.

1202
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:39,333
Really.

1203
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:45,916
You forgot your watch?

1204
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,166
Yes.

1205
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:49,333
Sorry.

1206
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:37,250
I didn't forget it.

1207
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:39,083
I threw it away!

1208
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:42,833
Threw what?

1209
01:31:42,916 --> 01:31:45,041
The gift you bought me out of guilt!

1210
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:50,875
-I don't understand.
-Who is it?

1211
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,791
Who? What?

1212
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:55,750
In Hong Kong, I spied on you.

1213
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:57,458
Who did you get in the taxi with?

1214
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:02,708
Tell me!

1215
01:32:03,541 --> 01:32:04,541
A singer?

1216
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:05,541
A manager?

1217
01:32:05,625 --> 01:32:06,500
An interpreter?

1218
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:07,458
Someone from Tinder?

1219
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:08,458
Who?

1220
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:21,666
Calm down, Gink.

1221
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:34,375
I went with Poupe.

1222
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:37,958
Which Poupe?

1223
01:32:38,916 --> 01:32:40,708
The girl you sang the duet with.

1224
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:43,625
She flew over for a trip.

1225
01:32:44,166 --> 01:32:45,458
So, we went out for dinner.

1226
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:50,583
And...

1227
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:53,291
You told me you'd go back
to the hotel, but you didn't.

1228
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,791
Why didn't you answer my calls?

1229
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:06,875
Poupe and I used to like each other
when we were in college.

1230
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:10,500
After we played music together
at the wedding,

1231
01:33:12,125 --> 01:33:13,375
we kept in touch.

1232
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:18,958
And...

1233
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:21,291
when you didn't come with me to record,

1234
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:24,625
Poupe flew out to see me.

1235
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:29,125
At first, we were...

1236
01:33:30,708 --> 01:33:32,000
just going to hang out.

1237
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,375
But things got out of hand.

1238
01:33:58,125 --> 01:33:59,750
Why didn't you just tell me that,

1239
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:02,750
after dinner, you went your separate ways?

1240
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:03,708
And...

1241
01:34:05,041 --> 01:34:08,166
you were so drunk
that you stayed at a hostel instead.

1242
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:11,583
You didn't answer my calls
because you fell asleep.

1243
01:34:11,916 --> 01:34:15,083
Or that someone else called you
when you woke up to pee.

1244
01:34:16,125 --> 01:34:17,625
Can't you make up excuses?

1245
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:27,833
I don't want to make things worse for you.

1246
01:34:29,791 --> 01:34:30,833
I've told you before.

1247
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:33,708
I don't like this kind of person.

1248
01:34:37,083 --> 01:34:38,166
I won't accept it.

1249
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:45,000
I know.

1250
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:11,041
I don't want to let you go.

1251
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,750
What's up, Maung Palm?

1252
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:08,000
Maung Gink.

1253
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:10,000
Do they also call girls "Maung"?

1254
01:36:15,541 --> 01:36:16,375
Here.

1255
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:17,875
Light the candle.

1256
01:36:17,958 --> 01:36:19,166
Make a wish.

1257
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:21,750
Then light the other end and put it down.

1258
01:36:47,791 --> 01:36:48,916
Ted didn't cheat on you?

1259
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:53,958
I want to give him another chance.

1260
01:37:03,041 --> 01:37:03,958
Damn you.

1261
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,375
Being friends is good enough, right?

1262
01:37:11,083 --> 01:37:11,916
Gink.

1263
01:37:12,708 --> 01:37:14,250
We like each other,
but we stay as friends.

1264
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:15,416
Friends, my ass.

1265
01:37:16,666 --> 01:37:18,208
Are we really just friends?

1266
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:19,875
You came here to see me.

1267
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,666
What did you tell Ted?

1268
01:37:26,333 --> 01:37:28,041
Did you tell him
that you're here to see me?

1269
01:37:28,416 --> 01:37:29,750
Did you even mention my name?

1270
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,916
Did you?

1271
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:37,125
See?

1272
01:37:42,416 --> 01:37:43,291
Palm.

1273
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:45,291
Palm.

1274
01:37:47,708 --> 01:37:49,708
You're very important to me.

1275
01:37:49,791 --> 01:37:52,166
Think about what would happen
if we broke up.

1276
01:37:52,458 --> 01:37:54,041
Who knows if we would break up or not?

1277
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:55,750
Can you foresee the future?

1278
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:00,875
I don't want to risk you.

1279
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,666
I shouldn't have asked you
to be just friends.

1280
01:38:17,583 --> 01:38:20,000
Would we have lasted this long
if you didn't?

1281
01:38:23,833 --> 01:38:25,625
I really can't stay any longer.

1282
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:30,708
When you have a girlfriend...

1283
01:38:31,125 --> 01:38:33,250
We can still be friends
again someday, right?

1284
01:38:39,666 --> 01:38:40,833
Right?

1285
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:43,625
If you take one more step, I'll kiss you!

1286
01:39:12,416 --> 01:39:15,125
FIVE MISSED CALLS

1287
01:39:24,916 --> 01:39:27,500
Beware. End of the walkway.

1288
01:39:38,166 --> 01:39:41,541
It was the worst breakup I've ever had,

1289
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:45,375
even though we weren't even a couple.

1290
01:39:54,125 --> 01:39:55,750
You guys don't have to get carried away.

1291
01:39:57,041 --> 01:39:58,166
Are you saying that...

1292
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:00,458
no matter how long we wait,

1293
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:03,541
there's no happy ending for us?

1294
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:07,541
If you cross the line...

1295
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:10,083
there's no going back.

1296
01:40:10,625 --> 01:40:11,791
How did you handle it?

1297
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:15,375
When the text has been read,
but there's no reply...

1298
01:40:16,541 --> 01:40:17,666
I can't sleep.

1299
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:22,750
I can't imagine my life without her.

1300
01:40:24,916 --> 01:40:26,041
How did you do it?

1301
01:40:32,166 --> 01:40:33,375
I had to start over

1302
01:40:33,916 --> 01:40:35,125
with new people.

1303
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,333
Hey.

1304
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:57,375
Are you making a wish or cursing me?

1305
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,333
Palm.

1306
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:02,708
Palm.

1307
01:41:24,416 --> 01:41:25,458
-Hey.
-What?

1308
01:41:26,458 --> 01:41:27,750
Buy three and get one for free.

1309
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:29,750
Don't you have high cholesterol?

1310
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:31,625
It's okay. One strip makes my day.

1311
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:33,958
One strip or one pack?

1312
01:41:35,375 --> 01:41:38,583
This pack is for our beef stroganoff.

1313
01:41:38,708 --> 01:41:40,708
It's a Russian must-have.

1314
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:42,041
This pack...

1315
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:43,791
-I'm going to make spaghetti
-No, that's fine.

1316
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:45,083
and bacon with dried chilies.

1317
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,416
Made with Thai flavors.

1318
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,083
The ad came out early?

1319
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:27,125
Are you Jackie Chan or what?

1320
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,583
Why are you so mean?

1321
01:42:38,666 --> 01:42:42,750
You know I overthink things

1322
01:42:43,458 --> 01:42:46,041
It makes my heart jittery

1323
01:42:46,125 --> 01:42:50,166
Who will take responsibility?

1324
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:53,416
I want to tell you

1325
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:57,333
How anxious I am

1326
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,291
Before you say anything

1327
01:42:59,375 --> 01:43:01,500
I want you to promise me

1328
01:43:01,583 --> 01:43:04,625
That you won't make me cry

1329
01:43:04,708 --> 01:43:08,416
Do you like shitting in the woods?

1330
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:11,791
Are we still together in our dreams?

1331
01:43:12,166 --> 01:43:15,625
Your heart hasn’t changed

1332
01:43:15,875 --> 01:43:19,416
And our love is still the same

1333
01:43:19,583 --> 01:43:22,958
All I want is for you to say it

1334
01:43:23,333 --> 01:43:26,916
Tell me that you think about it

1335
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:30,541
Tell me, so I am sure

1336
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:34,250
That our love is still the same

1337
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:37,083
Am I right?

1338
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:42,083
Goong-Gink.

1339
01:43:44,083 --> 01:43:45,041
Why are you smiling?

1340
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:47,958
What?

1341
01:43:48,875 --> 01:43:50,000
What are you smiling about?

1342
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:51,083
What are you thinking?

1343
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:53,458
Tell me now.

1344
01:43:53,791 --> 01:43:55,208
You won't tell me?

1345
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:08,750
I admit it.

1346
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:11,791
Even when I'm dating someone new,

1347
01:44:12,875 --> 01:44:15,125
I can't help but compare them to her.

1348
01:44:16,666 --> 01:44:18,583
So, I stopped talking to them all.

1349
01:44:19,958 --> 01:44:21,625
If I had to be friends with her,

1350
01:44:22,708 --> 01:44:23,750
that's also unacceptable.

1351
01:44:25,958 --> 01:44:26,791
Palm.

1352
01:44:29,875 --> 01:44:30,708
Trust me.

1353
01:44:31,083 --> 01:44:32,708
-Don't turn around.
-Gink?

1354
01:44:33,291 --> 01:44:34,208
Don't!

1355
01:44:34,833 --> 01:44:36,000
Gink, right?

1356
01:44:37,958 --> 01:44:38,916
That's enough.

1357
01:44:39,916 --> 01:44:41,375
I think you should go your own way.

1358
01:44:41,916 --> 01:44:43,166
I know it's not my place.

1359
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:44,666
But...

1360
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:46,708
you should stop bothering him,

1361
01:44:47,333 --> 01:44:49,416
or pretending you're still
friends with him.

1362
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:51,791
You need to understand

1363
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:53,458
that he can't be friends with you.

1364
01:44:54,041 --> 01:44:56,041
He can't be friends with you.

1365
01:45:00,708 --> 01:45:02,583
I don't want to be his friend either.

1366
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:46,208
What do you want?

1367
01:45:47,375 --> 01:45:48,791
I broke up with Ted!

1368
01:45:52,875 --> 01:45:54,916
Why? Did he cheat again?

1369
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:03,750
No, he didn't.

1370
01:46:05,958 --> 01:46:07,791
I want to see
the Northern Lights with you.

1371
01:46:17,416 --> 01:46:18,875
I need to ask you one question.

1372
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:20,208
I won't ask it again.

1373
01:46:22,458 --> 01:46:23,416
What?

1374
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:24,666
You and I,

1375
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,375
if we can't be friends anymore...

1376
01:46:28,416 --> 01:46:29,750
let's just get married, okay?

1377
01:46:31,458 --> 01:46:32,416
What?

1378
01:46:33,666 --> 01:46:34,875
Will you marry me?

1379
01:46:34,958 --> 01:46:36,375
What? I didn't hear you!

1380
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,041
I said...

1381
01:46:43,208 --> 01:46:45,291
Palm. You...

1382
01:47:08,666 --> 01:47:09,666
Are you okay?

1383
01:47:15,208 --> 01:47:17,208
I told her, "no marriage license."

1384
01:47:18,083 --> 01:47:20,125
In the end, she made me sign it.

1385
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:22,250
Damn!

1386
01:47:22,666 --> 01:47:23,541
Shit.

1387
01:47:23,625 --> 01:47:24,500
Man.

1388
01:47:25,458 --> 01:47:26,583
I'm so happy for you!

1389
01:47:32,833 --> 01:47:35,750
Your one decade didn't go to waste.

1390
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:37,208
You know,

1391
01:47:37,541 --> 01:47:40,791
we have always thought that...

1392
01:47:41,875 --> 01:47:44,750
the longer we wait, the less hope we have.

1393
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,916
The longer we're together,

1394
01:47:47,375 --> 01:47:48,791
the harder it gets to cut ties.

1395
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,166
My friend has been waiting.

1396
01:48:07,541 --> 01:48:08,916
I need to give this to her.

1397
01:48:14,166 --> 01:48:15,125
See you around.

1398
01:48:16,083 --> 01:48:17,500
Nice talking to you.

1399
01:48:18,166 --> 01:48:19,041
Same here.

1400
01:48:31,166 --> 01:48:32,250
What did you brag about?

1401
01:48:39,416 --> 01:48:40,666
Beer slushie, right?

1402
01:48:41,041 --> 01:48:42,208
I had to chill it first.

1403
01:48:42,291 --> 01:48:44,166
It's already a slushie. Shut up.

1404
01:48:45,791 --> 01:48:47,250
I was just giving them a pep talk.

1405
01:48:52,291 --> 01:48:53,125
Thanks.

1406
01:48:53,208 --> 01:48:54,041
Yes.

1407
01:48:54,708 --> 01:48:55,916
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1408
01:49:05,916 --> 01:49:07,500
Get your friend to bring it.

1409
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:10,166
Yes.

1410
01:49:14,541 --> 01:49:15,583
Where have you been?

1411
01:49:15,666 --> 01:49:16,708
Getting your beer.

1412
01:49:18,291 --> 01:49:19,125
Thanks.

1413
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:32,041
What?

1414
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:43,250
-Gink.
-What?

1415
01:49:43,875 --> 01:49:44,791
Your ring?

1416
01:49:51,083 --> 01:49:52,708
It must have fallen off
when I was dancing.

1417
01:49:55,625 --> 01:49:56,666
-Shit!
-Christ!

1418
01:49:56,958 --> 01:49:58,083
Calm down, Gink.

1419
01:49:58,166 --> 01:50:00,000
It's me, Ju. What are you looking for?

1420
01:50:00,125 --> 01:50:01,083
The wedding ring.

1421
01:50:01,166 --> 01:50:02,416
You lost my wedding ring?

1422
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:03,708
Look at your finger first.

1423
01:50:03,875 --> 01:50:05,000
Oh, it's here!

1424
01:50:05,833 --> 01:50:06,833
I'll help you look.

1425
01:50:06,916 --> 01:50:08,000
Honey, help us.

1426
01:50:08,166 --> 01:50:09,958
Help us look, please.

1427
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:13,291
Help us look for her wedding ring.

1428
01:50:14,083 --> 01:50:15,750
A wedding ring.

1429
01:50:16,375 --> 01:50:18,458
Could you please look for it?

1430
01:50:29,291 --> 01:50:30,458
I found it!

1431
01:50:35,958 --> 01:50:37,041
How did it go over there?

1432
01:50:37,125 --> 01:50:37,958
I don't know.

1433
01:50:40,166 --> 01:50:41,000
What?

1434
01:50:41,083 --> 01:50:42,625
You proposed to me first.

1435
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:44,041
Let me propose to you.

1436
01:50:44,333 --> 01:50:45,250
Palm.

1437
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:46,541
Get up.

1438
01:50:46,625 --> 01:50:47,583
Let me propose first.

1439
01:50:47,666 --> 01:50:49,708
-Don’t joke around. Everyone's looking.
-Stay still.

1440
01:50:50,041 --> 01:50:51,625
Palm, I said don't fool around.

1441
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:01,041
Be with me forever, okay?

1442
01:51:02,916 --> 01:51:03,833
Of course.

1443
01:51:07,166 --> 01:51:08,458
What? Get up.

1444
01:51:08,583 --> 01:51:09,458
Are you crazy?

1445
01:51:17,708 --> 01:51:19,708
Why can't I be like them?

1446
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:21,500
Go dump him.

1447
01:51:23,208 --> 01:51:24,083
I'm giddy.

1448
01:51:25,625 --> 01:51:26,583
Giddy for you.

1449
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:22,750
We don’t want to be just friends.
We want to be hubbies!

1450
01:52:22,833 --> 01:52:25,500
-Yes!
-Yes!

1451
01:53:22,208 --> 01:53:24,416
Oh, it's cold!

1452
01:53:27,583 --> 01:53:29,041
-Goong-Gink.
-Ted.

1453
01:53:30,083 --> 01:53:31,833
Goong-Gink.

1454
01:53:31,958 --> 01:53:33,875
It's like you're playing with a dog.

1455
01:53:34,666 --> 01:53:35,625
Damn it!

1456
01:53:36,041 --> 01:53:36,958
Oh, no!

1457
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:38,333
Just go be with her!

1458
01:53:42,333 --> 01:53:43,333
Louis!

1459
01:53:43,708 --> 01:53:45,041
Damn scary!

1460
01:53:48,208 --> 01:53:50,916
-Is this your first time in Krabi?
-Oh, we're just friends.

1461
01:53:53,875 --> 01:53:55,500
What did I ask her?

1462
01:53:58,625 --> 01:54:00,125
You look so evil.

1463
01:54:03,791 --> 01:54:05,083
Dude, you almost kissed me.

1464
01:54:05,166 --> 01:54:06,500
No one stopped him.

1465
01:54:07,916 --> 01:54:08,875
Ten years!

1466
01:54:09,791 --> 01:54:10,708
One more time.

1467
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:11,750
Ten years!

1468
01:54:12,541 --> 01:54:13,541
It's too normal.

1469
01:54:13,666 --> 01:54:14,541
Ten years!

1470
01:54:14,708 --> 01:54:15,666
I don't believe you.

1471
01:54:20,083 --> 01:54:21,916
I'll keep doing it.

1472
01:54:46,708 --> 01:54:49,041
One. Two. Three.

1473
01:56:55,125 --> 01:56:56,625
Have you asked if it is off-key or not?

1474
01:56:56,708 --> 01:56:59,333
I have to say very badly!

1475
01:58:34,875 --> 01:58:36,875
