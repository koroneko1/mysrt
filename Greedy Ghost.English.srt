1
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,125
CHAPTER ONE, THE WORDLESS SCRIPTURE

2
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,208
GRAB THE WEALTH TO BE GRABBED
OR LIVE TO REGRET!

3
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,833
You are such a loser!

4
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,500
Enough, stop laughing at him!

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,500
Can you stop it?

6
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,416
Let's go to the Guan Yin Temple
before we go back home later.

7
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,958
I've already told you.
You're very unlucky this year.

8
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,208
Stop mentioning it!

9
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,000
This is not the first time anyway.

10
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,000
NO ENTRY

11
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,541
SILVER NEEDLE NOODLES, MOUSE

12
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,833
That's all that's left of my dad?

13
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,833
So? Do you want us to clean it?

14
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,125
Hey! What the heck! What's this?

15
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,333
Sulfuric acid?

16
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:21,583
SULFURIC ACID, BAIJIU

17
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,250
I'm so sorry!

18
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,500
Right.

19
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,250
I have a question.

20
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,791
I have always wanted to ask you.

21
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,041
What is it?

22
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,083
Are you really your dad's son?

23
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,625
What did you say?

24
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,083
Nothing, I just find it weird.

25
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,958
His dad gave him a very horrible name.

26
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,000
Bad Luck Lim.

27
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,458
It's Lim Dao Mei.

28
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,833
It means beautiful in Chinese.

29
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,500
How many times do I have to tell you?

30
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,875
Are your names very nice?

31
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,541
-Let's eat.
-Eat.

32
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,916
Don't finish all the vegetables.
Leave some for me.

33
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,458
Someone jumped off the building!

34
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,791
Someone jumped off the building!

35
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,833
Hurry!

36
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,208
What took you so long?

37
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,791
-Run Fa.
-What?

38
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,625
Why did you come in with your shoes on?

39
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,500
Also, Dao Mei plucked my red flower again.

40
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,291
Yes, I want a flower bath, okay?

41
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,458
Help me with it.

42
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,500
Why are you still here?

43
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,125
Someone jumped off the building!

44
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,208
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,833
It was a nightmare.

46
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,458
Is he okay?

47
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,750
Don't be so nosy!

48
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,958
Aren't you supposed to be
on the night shift?

49
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,291
Hey, Jia Hui. Let's go for supper.

50
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,000
No, thank you. I want to sleep.

51
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,791
My hair will fall out
if I don't sleep enough.

52
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,208
You guys go ahead.

53
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,583
Let's go!

54
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,875
Hey, handsome.

55
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,791
These are tomorrow's jackpot
winning numbers.

56
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,041
Quick. Go and place your bet.

57
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,041
I've given you the numbers.

58
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,708
Aren't you going to bet?

59
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,750
Hey, Jia Hui.

60
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,375
Jia Hui!

61
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,791
Wake up!

62
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,125
You're so noisy!

63
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,875
Hey, are you playing a prank on me?

64
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,083
Jia Hui, stop playing with me!

65
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,208
What happened?

66
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,166
You're the one who woke me up!

67
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,083
Who is playing a prank now?

68
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,416
Hey, try saying this,

69
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,875
"I've given you the numbers.

70
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,541
Aren't you going to bet?"

71
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,333
Come on, say it.

72
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,250
"I've given you the numbers.

73
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,750
Aren't you going to bet?"

74
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,000
Can you be more serious?

75
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,791
-One more time!
-What?

76
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,375
That is not the right tone.

77
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,000
The tone is wrong?

78
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,166
"I've given you the numbers.

79
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,291
Aren't you going to bet?"

80
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,041
"I've given you the numbers.

81
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,875
Aren't you going to bet?"

82
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,375
"I've given you the numbers.

83
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,791
Aren't you going to bet?"

84
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,250
Can I sleep now?

85
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,875
Was I dreaming?

86
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,833
Impossible!

87
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,791
Hey, it's drawing now!

88
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,875
If I win the jackpot,

89
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,375
I will be very rich!

90
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,708
If you really do win,

91
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,500
you need to do some charity work.

92
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,791
-Great!
-Come.

93
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,625
-Let's make a donation tomorrow.
-Shut up!

94
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,083
8.

95
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,000
18.

96
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,875
20.

97
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,375
28.

98
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,333
33.

99
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,208
38.

100
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,875
And 17.

101
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,791
Crap!

102
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,458
You don't have to curse.

103
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,875
If it's yours, it's yours.
If it's not, it's not.

104
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,541
You're not the one buying.

105
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,333
Of course it's easy for you to say!

106
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,958
Stop fighting.

107
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,958
Let's eat, the vegetables are fresh!

108
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,208
Hey, what are you doing?

109
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,625
You won the jackpot?

110
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,000
How many numbers did you win?

111
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,583
Three? Four?

112
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,041
Or five?

113
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,875
All!

114
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,333
You got all the numbers?

115
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,750
You won the jackpot?

116
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,416
But I didn't bet.

117
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,791
You didn't bet?

118
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,750
I saw the numbers in a book.

119
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,958
Then I heard a voice saying

120
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,458
these are the winning jackpot numbers

121
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,125
and asked me to bet on them.

122
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,625
But I thought I was hallucinating,

123
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,250
so I didn't bet.

124
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,708
That was obviously the voice
of the God of Wealth,

125
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,750
but you didn't bet!

126
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,208
You should have given your blessings

127
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,041
to someone more intelligent!

128
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,708
But then again, you're quite lucky
to be able to spot

129
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,333
the winning numbers.

130
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,750
Maybe if I made that bet,

131
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,791
it wouldn't have been drawn.

132
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,583
You said that
you saw the numbers in a book.

133
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,041
Where is the book?

134
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,125
I think I've thrown it away.

135
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,208
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,208
I've emptied the bin.

137
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,041
You've thrown it away?

138
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,875
My goodness!

139
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,500
What are you still doing here?

140
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,291
Go get it back!

141
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,416
Cindy.

142
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,875
You really impressed me!

143
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,208
I'm amazed you could still find it
in such a dirty place.

144
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,625
I'm even more envious of you!

145
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,750
Where did you find such a good girlfriend?

146
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,750
I'm even more impressed by you two!

147
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,916
How can you two talk to her
when she is so smelly?

148
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,041
What are you still doing here?

149
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,041
Go take a bath!

150
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,500
I'm warning you,

151
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,291
if you can't get rid of that smell,

152
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,625
you'll sleep in the toilet!

153
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,750
I've gone through it a dozen times,
but there's nothing.

154
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,916
Don't give me that.

155
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,666
You are the one
who got his girlfriend dirty.

156
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,166
Explain it to him.

157
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,208
It seems like that's a wordless scripture.

158
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,083
What is a wordless scripture?

159
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,416
Didn't you watch movies from the past?

160
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,625
You needed to go through a lot

161
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,375
if you wanted to know

162
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,958
the secret inside.

163
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,416
Nonsense!

164
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,708
You shouldn't play with knives
even if the fire doesn't work!

165
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,291
That's how it is in the movies.

166
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,500
When fire and water fail,

167
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,375
-blood is the next best solution!
-Don't play with it!

168
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,166
Give it to me!

169
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,416
And you! What numbers?

170
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
You must be playing a prank on us!

171
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,958
What?

172
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,000
Did you see that?

173
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,541
What did you see?

174
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,583
The numbers!

175
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,375
Inside the book!

176
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,500
There's nothing there!

177
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,666
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

178
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,166
No, there are really numbers in the book.

179
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,291
I think you're out of your mind!

180
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,125
Crazy!

181
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,875
I really saw the numbers!

182
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,416
Do you think I am crazy too?

183
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,791
No!

184
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,458
But if I trust you,

185
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,208
then I'm the crazy one.

186
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,958
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.

187
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,125
I'M NOT CRAZY EITHER!

188
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,000
Sorry, I really didn't see it.

189
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,541
I've given you the numbers.
Aren't you going to bet?

190
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,916
Stop looking for me. You won't find me.

191
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,958
I'm asking you, are you going to bet?

192
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,500
Don't you understand Mandarin?

193
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,583
I've given you the numbers.
Aren't you going to bet?

194
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,125
I've already given you the numbers.
Aren't you going to bet?

195
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,333
I've given you the numbers.
Aren't you going to bet?

196
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,208
Can you stop staring at me?

197
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,458
-I'm shy!
-I'm saying,

198
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,791
aren't you going to bet?

199
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,333
How many times do you want me to ask you?

200
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,791
Are you going to bet?

201
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,333
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,833
Give me a set of newspapers.

203
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,625
I've given you the numbers.

204
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,333
Aren't you going to bet?

205
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,708
I've given you the numbers.
Aren't you going to bet?

206
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,708
Idiot, I'm using the toilet!

207
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,500
I've given you the numbers.

208
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,541
Aren't you going to bet?

209
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,000
Are you having nightmares again?

210
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,916
Is it that terrible?

211
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,125
The lady, Indian guy, and even myself

212
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,291
are telling me this.

213
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,208
"I've given you the numbers.

214
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,791
Aren't you going to bet?"

215
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,291
"I've given you the numbers.

216
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,208
Aren't you going to bet?"

217
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,166
"I've given you the numbers. Aren't…"

218
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,750
It's terrifying!

219
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,000
So is it the lady,
the Indian guy, or yourself?

220
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,625
Are you sick?

221
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,916
I think you are possessed.

222
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,291
He's sick!

223
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,333
He's possessed!

224
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,750
He's sick!

225
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,500
He's possessed!

226
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,875
He's sick!

227
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,458
-He's possessed!
-He's sick!

228
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,458
He's possessed!

229
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,833
This is what happens
when you daydream too much.

230
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,541
If your features look good,

231
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,000
you'll have ten years of good fortune.

232
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,041
What do you mean?

233
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,916
Stress can cause hallucinations.

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,666
You already have everything you need.

235
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,083
You are perfect in every way!

236
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:32,791
It's good!

237
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,208
I shall give you some tranquilizer,
and you'll be fine.

238
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,750
-So I'll be fine?
-Yes, you'll be fine.

239
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,416
You are the luckiest person around!

240
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,791
How can it be?

241
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,000
This is the best pick!
You are completely in luck!

242
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,000
Everyone wants to win the jackpot.

243
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,416
If you want to win, then bet.

244
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,833
Have you bet on numbers recently?

245
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,791
So go and bet on the jackpot numbers!

246
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,291
If anyone gives you any numbers,

247
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,000
you must go and bet on them!

248
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,666
You're destined to win!

249
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,166
Why are you sleeping here?

250
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,875
I've given you the numbers.

251
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,666
Aren't you going to bet?

252
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,041
I've given you the numbers.

253
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,958
Aren't you going to bet?

254
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,500
They…

255
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,500
I've given you the numbers.

256
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,375
Aren't you going to bet?

257
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,875
I've given you the numbers.

258
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,833
Aren't you going to bet?

259
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:06,333
I've given you the numbers.
Aren't you going to bet?

260
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,500
Aren't you going to bet?

261
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:13,166
I've given you the numbers.
Aren't you going to bet?

262
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,458
Hey, handsome!

263
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,958
Are you trying to hide from me?

264
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,541
Do you think you can hide so easily?

265
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,750
Who are you?

266
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,083
I'm the spirit of the magical book.

267
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,291
You can call me Fairy Godfather.

268
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,125
I'm here to bring good fortune
to you unlucky losers

269
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,250
so that you'll never have bad luck again!

270
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,000
Really? Never?

271
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,541
Really? I won't have bad luck anymore?

272
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,666
Can you make me wealthy?

273
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,875
Don't ask me. Ask yourself.

274
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,166
Do you want to be rich?

275
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,958
I've given you the numbers.
Aren't you going to bet?

276
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,708
Aren't you going to bet?

277
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,416
Aren't you going to bet?

278
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,833
Aren't you going to bet?

279
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,791
I will bet.

280
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,333
Are you really going to bet?

281
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,250
I will!

282
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,416
Are you really going to bet?

283
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,666
I will!

284
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,791
You'll still bet
even if there is a price to pay?

285
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,000
No matter what price I have to pay,

286
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,291
I will bet!

287
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,708
Good! It's your own choice,
I didn't force you.

288
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,000
Everybody saw it, I didn't force you!

289
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:49,625
I will bet…

290
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,500
It's so easy to tell an idiot
by the looks.

291
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,375
Qiang Qiang, Wang Wang, come and eat.

292
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,250
Come…

293
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,875
Hey! Can you stop walking around?

294
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,083
I'm telling you, you won't win.

295
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,958
If you win, I'll help you wipe your ass

296
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,375
for one month.

297
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,041
It is time for the broadcast
of this week's jackpot number.

298
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:23,375
-The winning numbers are…
-Listen.

299
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,125
-4.
-4.

300
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,458
-14.
-14.

301
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,083
-24.
-24! That's three matches!

302
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,583
-34.
-34.

303
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,958
40.

304
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,666
-41.
-41…

305
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,833
-The special number is…
-44!

306
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,958
44!

307
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,541
-It's 44! Jackpot!
-Really?

308
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,500
-All of it? Let me have a look!
-Jackpot!

309
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,625
You won RM600,000!

310
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,041
I won RM600,000!

311
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,708
This is my first time winning the jackpot!

312
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,166
Congratulations!

313
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,458
Congratulations!

314
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,125
Thank you for your blessing.

315
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,625
Thank you for your grace.

316
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,958
Don't tell me you didn't bet on it again.

317
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,041
Nonsense! What is this then?

318
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,916
Right.

319
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,625
My stomach is aching.

320
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,458
I need to take a dump.

321
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,041
WIPE HIS ASS FOR ONE MONTH

322
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,208
Wait.

323
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,125
Can you smell it?

324
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,500
No.

325
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,416
What?

326
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,583
DID YOU FART?

327
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,250
Money! The smell of money!

328
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,333
-Tell her.
-Hello, miss.

329
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,333
Hello, gorgeous.

330
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,875
We are here to collect our prize.

331
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,333
We won this week's RM600,000 jackpot.

332
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,291
Please queue there.

333
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,541
What? So many people won?

334
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:56,125
Yes. There are a total of 12 winners
including you.

335
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,333
Twelve people?

336
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,958
What is that supposed to mean?

337
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:04,041
It means you will have to share the money

338
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,750
with 11 other people.

339
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,541
That is RM50,000 each.

340
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:10,708
RM50,000?

341
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,541
Well, it's still lots of money.

342
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,875
Let's queue up.

343
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,041
I'll treat you
after I get the prize money.

344
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,291
Okay.

345
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,375
I'm not sure
if I should pity him or praise him.

346
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,458
Loser!

347
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,875
What? Do you think you're the winner?

348
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,541
Don't come for the celebration later.

349
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:36,083
No way! We're brothers,
we should celebrate together!

350
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,625
Loser!

351
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,375
CHAPTER TWO,
MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL

352
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,416
EVEN BIRDS OF THE SAME FLOCK
WILL PART WAYS?

353
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,541
You have no ambition!

354
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,583
One should have dreams.

355
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,166
Just like this!

356
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,333
No!

357
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,666
It should be like this.

358
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,833
My goodness! You're such an idiot!

359
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,125
You two are the idiot ones!

360
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,500
Can you afford such cars
with only RM50,000?

361
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,750
It's not even enough
to pay for the four sport rims!

362
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,750
Since you have such a lucky windfall,

363
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,708
you should use some of the money
to do charity.

364
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:59,416
-So that--
-Are you crazy? Nonsense!

365
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,166
You're the one who's crazy!

366
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,208
Bean sprouts.

367
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,708
Vegetable, bean curd.

368
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,166
Mixed vegetables.

369
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,166
We don't want those.

370
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,875
Prosperity abalone.

371
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,000
Wealthy shark's fin.

372
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:22,250
And also Buddha Jumps Over the Wall!

373
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:25,125
Hey, I only won RM50,000, not RM600,000.

374
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,875
Hey, it's RM50,000!
You can afford these dishes!

375
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:29,083
You're so calculative!

376
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,625
One more. A bowl of bird's nest!

377
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,666
Hey! You're a little too much!

378
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,916
He won RM50,000, not RM600,000.

379
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,333
Also, is bird's nest a vegetarian dish?

380
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:38,791
Yes!

381
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,500
I also want a bowl.

382
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,041
My RM50,000!

383
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,875
You still have a fortune
after such an expensive meal.

384
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,500
Come, let's go party!

385
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,375
It is as if the money belongs to him.

386
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,750
We've been here for a while.

387
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:21,250
Why are there no girls talking to us?

388
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:26,250
Maybe if we order expensive liquor,

389
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,875
we will be able to attract the girls!

390
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,541
No sight of anyone coming.

391
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,000
Maybe this is not good enough.

392
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,666
Shall we order a better one?

393
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,416
There is still no one.

394
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:56,375
I'm sure these liquors
are not expensive enough!

395
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,708
Shall we get more expensive ones?

396
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,541
Of course! Let's do it!

397
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,208
Our table is full now,

398
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:15,416
but there are still no girls.

399
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,041
It must be the price!

400
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:22,125
I suggest we get a super expensive bottle!

401
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,583
Stop ordering.

402
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:28,583
Have you ever thought
that it might not be the liquor,

403
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:30,041
but the matter of looks?

404
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:32,916
Why do you look like that?

405
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,291
There's even a fringe on top of your head!

406
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,458
Compared to both of them,
you are handsome.

407
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,708
Let's go.

408
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:58,125
My RM50,000.

409
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,583
Now, I'm left with about RM8,000.

410
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,916
Can't I spend it slowly?

411
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,166
Do you want…

412
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,333
to earn back…

413
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:12,000
all the money you've spent?

414
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,041
We'll get it back!

415
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,416
Get it all back?

416
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:37,750
Check!

417
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,583
Check!

418
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,166
Game!

419
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,583
Game!

420
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,125
Double check!

421
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,458
Game!

422
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,125
Game!

423
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,125
Royal flush!

424
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:05,333
-Thank you. Please come again.
-Thank you. Please come again.

425
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:15,833
Didn't you say you wanted to help me
to get my money back?

426
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:19,708
We lost RM8,000 in less than two hours!

427
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,583
Come on.

428
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,375
Money is just a material thing.

429
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:26,416
If it's yours, it's yours.

430
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,666
If it's not, it's not.

431
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,208
But it seems that
my money doesn't belong to me.

432
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:34,541
Whatever wasn't yours became yours!

433
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,416
You're spending my money like it's yours!

434
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:41,291
Didn't you have a part
in spending the money?

435
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,625
I brought you to play mahjong,

436
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,458
but I never asked you
to lose all your money!

437
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,375
Fine.

438
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:05,041
It's all my fault.

439
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:09,083
Hey, where did you say
the numbers were from?

440
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,875
The book from the guy who jumped.

441
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,625
But you never believed me.

442
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,500
Hey.

443
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,791
Why don't we try it again?

444
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,125
Hey.

445
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:23,541
Stop fooling around with the belongings
of the dead!

446
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,000
Gosh!

447
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:28,500
Didn't you eat the bird's nest too?

448
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,625
Okay!

449
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,416
Let's do it one more time.

450
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,000
Are you ready?

451
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:57,458
Is there anything?

452
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,666
-Anything?
-Nothing.

453
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,083
Really?

454
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:04,875
Nothing?

455
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,500
I told you.

456
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,791
Don't fool around with the dead's
belongings. But you never listen.

457
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:12,875
Have another look!

458
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,250
-It's here!
-You saw it?

459
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,125
Wait! Let me grab a pen!

460
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,625
-What is it?
-What is it?

461
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:25,333
-"You."
-"You."

462
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,541
"Go to…"

463
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,875
"Hell."

464
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:31,916
That's not funny!

465
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,583
No, it really says, "Go to hell."

466
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:40,041
Are you still mad at me
for spending all your money?

467
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,125
No.

468
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,583
We're brothers!

469
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,416
How could you ask us to go to hell?

470
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,375
No.

471
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,375
You saw the numbers,
but you said you didn't!

472
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,958
If you don't want to share
the fortune with us, just say it!

473
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,583
You don't have to tell us to go to hell!

474
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,875
No, there really weren't any numbers.

475
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,208
Hello. Jia Hui. Yes?

476
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:00,291
Job? Sure, we'll be right over.

477
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,125
Hey, there's a job. Do you want to go?

478
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,541
Of course!

479
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,916
Someone is pretending
not to see the numbers.

480
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,541
He even told us to go to hell!

481
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:11,250
Going to work is always better
than going to hell!

482
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,458
Let me explain.

483
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:14,458
Come on, let's go! Let me get changed!

484
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,833
I am really speechless.

485
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:21,583
I…

486
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,125
Shit.

487
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,875
I'm so pissed off right now.

488
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:36,916
We are long-time friends.
How can he tell us to go to hell?

489
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,125
You shouldn't blame Dao Mei.

490
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,291
Some people change

491
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,958
when given wealth!

492
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:49,666
He should be the one going to hell!

493
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,750
Don't talk nonsense here!

494
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,125
Gold!

495
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:09,458
Now, this is what we call fate.

496
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:12,208
There's so much jewelry buried with her.

497
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,166
Like I always say,
if it's yours, it's yours.

498
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,500
If it's not, it's not.

499
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,875
Well, not really.

500
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,750
Hey, never take from the dead!

501
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,458
You have done the right thing.

502
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:30,166
Some wealth is not meant for sharing.

503
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,500
Friendships these days
are not worth a penny!

504
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:35,083
It's a passe term already!

505
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:38,291
I've given you the numbers.
Aren't you going to bet?

506
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,791
If it's head, then forget it.

507
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,416
If it's tail, then I'm all in!

508
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,000
These are treasures!

509
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,875
How can I not take any?

510
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:10,375
Sorry, ma'am.

511
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:13,375
These are supposedly yours,

512
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:16,000
but now, they are now mine.

513
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,500
-Thank you.
-Run Fa!

514
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:19,791
Don't take from the dead.
It's very bad luck!

515
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,541
See!

516
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:30,166
Even the heaven
is against putting them back!

517
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,250
Hey, don't take it.

518
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,791
One shouldn't take from the dead!

519
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,291
It's bad karma. Do you hear me?

520
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,083
Okay, let's flip for it.

521
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:42,666
If it's an auspicious sign,
then we'll take it, okay?

522
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,458
Bear in mind. We'll only take it
if it's an auspicious sign!

523
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:52,375
It's not! So you can't have it!

524
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,625
-Best of three.
-How could you?

525
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,125
See! It's still not! Let's forget it!

526
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,458
-It's not auspicious!
-Best of five!

527
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,750
You…

528
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:08,458
Look! Three in a row!

529
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:09,375
No means no!

530
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,583
One shouldn't be so superstitious!

531
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,375
Don't you remember what our job is?

532
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,125
You…

533
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:17,500
Don't take it!

534
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,500
Finders keepers!

535
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:25,000
My goodness.

536
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,416
And it's beautiful!

537
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:30,958
Hey, don't!

538
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:45,583
I'm sorry.

539
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:56,500
It is time for the broadcast
of this week's jackpot number.

540
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,250
The winning numbers are…

541
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,791
1.

542
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:00,833
2.

543
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,500
3.

544
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,583
4.

545
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,541
5.

546
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:13,708
6.

547
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:18,000
The special number is 7.

548
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:22,208
The jackpot-winning numbers
are brought to you by Biao.

549
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:09,083
1.5 million is enough
to let you live a happy life.

550
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,750
What? Not enough? You want more?

551
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,791
Again? Not enough?

552
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,083
Again?

553
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:25,750
Don't tell me you are using the money
as your wallpaper.

554
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:29,541
Aren't you worried that Run Fa
will spend all your money again?

555
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,125
I know you are going to throw a tantrum.

556
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:42,458
Be careful. When I…

557
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,416
It hurts!

558
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,958
How could you ask me
to let you win every week?

559
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:52,750
I might not be human,
but I could also get tired.

560
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:55,541
Let me introduce an agent to you.

561
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,250
He's very good at money laundering.

562
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:00,041
He can definitely make you richer.
All right?

563
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,875
Hello, Mr. Lim. How are you?

564
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:04,791
I am a senior investment agent
from Prosperity Investment.

565
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,416
This is my name card.

566
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,875
Our company has a lot of investment plans

567
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:10,958
catered to help you make more money.

568
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,458
Let's discuss inside. Come on!

569
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,375
A lot of Middle Eastern bosses
are waiting for you.

570
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,333
Do you know how to invest?

571
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:21,333
Did the property investor teach you?

572
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:24,541
How would people like us understand
such money-making theories?

573
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,083
Be careful. Watch where you're going.

574
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,041
Game!

575
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,250
Didn't I tell you?

576
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:52,666
How would we know about money-making?

577
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,750
Pay me!

578
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,958
Sir, you have one less card! You lose!

579
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,583
You lose!

580
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:04,458
-Money!
-Money!

581
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,791
Book Spirit, do me a favor!

582
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:10,625
-Which car should I choose?
-Of course the big ones.

583
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,750
You'll have enough room to make out in it!

584
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,125
This one.

585
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,208
This one too, and that black one.

586
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,791
This one is even better.
I'll take all of them!

587
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,666
Hey, Dao Mei.

588
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,166
This is really weird.

589
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,791
Why is it that the more you spend,
the more money you have?

590
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,416
Hey!

591
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,958
Don't run every time I talk about money.

592
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:40,666
I just want to help you make a donation!

593
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,875
For what?

594
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:43,666
I just wanted to remind you.

595
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,125
Since you've been making a fortune,
have you done any charity?

596
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:51,000
Is there anything better
to talk about between us?

597
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,458
Not every day is a good time for charity.

598
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,625
We need to wait for the moment.

599
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,791
This is the moment!

600
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:01,500
Look at all these pitiful elderlies!

601
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:03,916
Since you're so lucky lately,
why don't you buy from them?

602
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,541
You may win even more!

603
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:06,666
Nonsense!

604
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,333
It's unethical to do charity
with the aim of making a fortune!

605
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,625
I don't need this kind of luck!

606
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,458
Besides, I once heard

607
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,666
these vendors on wheelchairs
are often conmen.

608
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,291
-You…
-I'm leaving.

609
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,125
Dao Mei!

610
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:27,625
Of the many condominiums you've seen,
which one do you prefer?

611
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,708
The first one is posh and steady.

612
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:31,041
Jacky Wu is your neighbor.

613
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:32,625
The second one is near the city.

614
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,333
It has very meticulous security.

615
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,208
This one has perfect feng shui.

616
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,458
It will help you make a fortune!

617
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,291
Hey.

618
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,625
Which one should I buy?

619
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,583
The first one. I like Kang Kang.

620
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,916
What's so good about Kang Kang?
He looks like a toad.

621
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,541
I can't believe someone would marry him.

622
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:54,666
Moreover, that house belongs to Jacky Wu,
not Kang Kang.

623
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,041
Well, Kang Kang and Jacky are buddies.
He may come to visit.

624
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:59,416
No, I'm not talking to you.

625
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,208
Hey.

626
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,958
Which one should I buy?

627
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,916
Jacky Wu has been down on his luck lately.

628
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,833
It's better to buy the one
with good feng shui for your business.

629
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:12,958
Okay, I'll take this one.

630
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:14,916
-Thank you.
-Dear, I don't want this one.

631
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,500
This one is good.

632
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,791
CHAPTER THREE, MADAM BUTTERFLY

633
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:39,625
THERE IS ALWAYS SOME GHOST
SCARIER OUT THERE?

634
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:49,708
Didn't you say everything is already sold?

635
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,583
Why is the jade pendant
still on your neck?

636
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,916
Don't you think we are a perfect match?

637
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,875
I told you, but you didn't believe me.

638
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:00,875
Never bring this wicked stuff with you.

639
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,166
Don't you remember what our profession is?

640
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,583
Must you be so superstitious?

641
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:07,166
Superstitious?

642
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,083
Let me tell you, I used to have a friend

643
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:11,333
who found a jade pendant on the floor.

644
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:12,291
In the end--

645
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:14,041
He was haunted by a female ghost, right?

646
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,875
He was repeatedly raped by the ghost

647
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,250
and eventually died, right?

648
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,416
Stop talking nonsense!

649
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,791
You're the one talking nonsense!

650
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,916
Are there so many ghosts
in the world for you to meet?

651
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:28,541
Ma'am, you almost scared me to death!

652
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:30,750
Do you want to buy some tissue paper?

653
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,375
No! Go away!

654
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:33,916
I have loads of them back home!

655
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,250
I'll buy some from you.

656
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:38,375
Thank you.

657
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,500
Hey, are you hungry?

658
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:43,083
Come, let's eat together.

659
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,208
-Thank you.
-Have a seat.

660
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:46,708
We ordered a lot of dishes.

661
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:48,625
We can't finish them all.
Come and help us eat.

662
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,041
Here are the chopsticks.

663
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:56,875
Have a satay.

664
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:11,000
You have a very beautiful pendant.

665
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:13,416
I used to have one too.

666
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:18,791
Ma'am, stop bragging!

667
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:23,000
This is an antique jade
from the Qing Dynasty.

668
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:26,333
If you really had one,
you wouldn't be selling tissue paper!

669
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,541
I'm serious.

670
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:32,416
I really had an identical one.

671
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:37,833
But it was stolen by some villains.

672
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,708
People nowadays are so unethical.

673
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:42,541
They could even steal from the elderly.

674
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:45,250
What could I do?

675
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:47,166
You suffer when you grow old.

676
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:49,916
It's all because of these two idiots

677
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:53,500
who stole my jade.

678
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:55,333
Actually, I would rather die

679
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,541
than let them take my pendant.

680
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:04,083
At first, they could not
take it away from me.

681
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:08,041
But then, they barbarously broke my arm
to steal my pendant!

682
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,000
My broken arm is still in pain.

683
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,875
In fact, it still hurts now.

684
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,250
Ma'am.

685
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,791
Are you sure it's just two,

686
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,958
not three of them?

687
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:37,041
Well,

688
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:39,916
can you describe how they stole your jade?

689
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Shut up!

690
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:45,416
Because you are the one who broke my arm!

691
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:49,625
You!

692
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:33,208
Idiots!

693
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:37,375
My arm really hurts…

694
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:40,125
I'm still in pain!

695
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,333
My arm is still in pain!

696
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:54,958
Idiots!

697
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:10,541
Idiots!

698
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:15,083
My arm really hurts…

699
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:17,583
I'm still in pain!

700
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,291
Did you hear that?

701
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:12,125
I'm still in pain!

702
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:19,166
Idiots!

703
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:23,125
It's all your fault!

704
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:25,375
I told you not to steal from the dead,

705
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:26,916
but you didn't listen!

706
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:32,041
Ma'am.

707
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,916
I will never do it again.

708
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,041
Please don't come for me.

709
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,708
Ma'am, please don't come for me.

710
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,875
What happened?

711
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:55,708
It's you. You scared me!

712
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,500
Why are you sitting here?

713
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,250
What are you doing?

714
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:05,666
We were waiting for you!
Why are you so late?

715
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,666
Why is it so wet here?

716
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,541
-Earlier, he--
-Why are you asking so many questions?

717
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,458
Don't you stink?

718
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:17,416
You'd better clean up fast!

719
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,583
I'm going to bathe.

720
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,458
It's been too hot lately!

721
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,375
Hey, are you sure this is the right place?

722
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,208
This place looks too high class.

723
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:46,708
That lady looked really poor.

724
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,416
She couldn't have afforded this place.

725
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,041
When you stole her things and sold them,

726
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,083
did you think that she was poor then?

727
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:55,625
Be sincere.

728
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:57,500
Okay.

729
00:48:57,583 --> 00:49:00,875
You've been nagging since we left home.

730
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:02,333
Aren't you tired?

731
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:09,666
I've asked a master.
Usually, for situations like this,

732
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:13,291
pray sincerely and return the items,
then everything will be fine.

733
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:15,041
Really?

734
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:17,500
The master even wrote it down.
Take a look.

735
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,291
But the jade pendant and I
are a perfect match.

736
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,041
What if I return it, but she still comes?

737
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,166
Wouldn't I be at a loss?

738
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,333
Let's go.

739
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,583
It's right in front.

740
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:43,166
Who are you looking for?

741
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,708
We are looking for Madam Chou

742
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:47,291
who was previously buried in Semenyih.

743
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:49,083
She recently moved here.

744
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:51,541
She was my elder sister.

745
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:53,333
Are you here to offer prayers for her?

746
00:49:53,416 --> 00:49:55,791
We came to apologize.

747
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:58,375
Bid farewell!

748
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:05,625
Actually, we were
your late sister's good friends.

749
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:11,333
I'm giving you a chance to say it again.

750
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:16,250
We really are her good friends.

751
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,041
You rogues.

752
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:20,875
You really don't know
who my elder sister was?

753
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:21,916
Who?

754
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,833
She was the renowned Madam Butterfly.

755
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:27,416
Madam Butterfly?

756
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,625
You've never heard of her?

757
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:31,750
Of course, we've heard of her.

758
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:33,333
Actually, we wanted to--

759
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:34,916
Stop talking nonsense.

760
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,375
Actually, we've offended your sister.

761
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:39,625
You offended her?

762
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:42,041
No, we…

763
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:45,625
We unintentionally took her things.

764
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:47,791
Can you stop lying?

765
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,708
It's true, we're not lying!

766
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:53,458
Those who stole from my sister

767
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:56,916
would usually die
or suffer a painful fate.

768
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:02,250
Quick! Apologize to Madam Butterfly!

769
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,208
-Sorry…
-Sorry…

770
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:07,208
Sorry, I won't do it again.

771
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:08,875
We are sorry.

772
00:51:10,416 --> 00:51:13,500
How would we know if she has forgiven us?

773
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:15,541
We'll flip for it.

774
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,291
Quick.

775
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:20,750
Please.

776
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,625
Be sincere. Quick!

777
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,500
I told you to be sincere. Quick!

778
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:01,416
There's no one here.

779
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,833
Where did everyone go?

780
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,208
How would I know?

781
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,208
I beg for your blessings.

782
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:18,125
Let's go, hurry!

783
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:22,125
Hey, just leave it! Hurry!

784
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:22,291
Do you have other girlfriends?

785
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,333
No.

786
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:24,708
-Really?
-Yes.

787
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:26,125
What about in the past?

788
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:27,958
I had one.

789
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,833
Why didn't you stay with her?

790
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,833
Her family opposed it.

791
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:35,833
-Her family? Who? Her dad?
-Yes.

792
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:38,083
-No.
-Her mom?

793
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:39,166
Also no.

794
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,708
Then who?

795
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:41,916
Her husband.

796
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,916
You are so bad!

797
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:50,708
Go. Cross the road.

798
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:00,625
Darling, what are you doing?

799
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:04,208
-Darling.
-Why did you tell me to cross the road?

800
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,208
I didn't tell you to cross the road!

801
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:07,791
I wasn't talking to you!

802
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:10,875
You should be careful. You scared me.

803
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:13,583
You should go. Let's meet again.

804
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:17,333
What the heck?

805
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,500
Book Spirit! Where are you?

806
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:29,875
Come out! Stop hiding!

807
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:32,083
Where are you? Book Spirit!

808
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:42,125
Wasn't that fun?
A lorry that big couldn't run you down!

809
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:43,708
Fun?

810
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:45,875
You told me to cross the road!

811
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:48,833
Answer the call first.

812
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:50,541
I'll get back to you later!

813
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:57,750
David.

814
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:01,416
A buyer for my lucky house?

815
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,333
Offering 30% more than the market value?

816
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:07,291
Of course I want to sell it!

817
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,875
The higher the price the better!

818
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,875
-Where were we?
-See?

819
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:19,791
The price of your lucky house is soaring.

820
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:23,750
Didn't I tell you it was a lucky house?

821
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:26,333
Then why did you try to get me
run over by a vehicle?

822
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:29,416
Have you forgotten
there is a price to pay for your fortune?

823
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:33,875
You'll still bet
even if there is a price to pay?

824
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:35,875
No matter what price I have to pay,

825
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:36,916
I will bet!

826
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:41,416
Then what is it that you want from me?

827
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:45,291
Be my replacement and take over
as the new book spirit!

828
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:47,375
Become the new book spirit?

829
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:51,791
How do I replace you
as the new book spirit?

830
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:53,041
Die!

831
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:55,958
Die?

832
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:00,250
I don't want to die.

833
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:03,125
I don't want to die!

834
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:05,583
-You have no choice.
-I don't want to die!

835
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:07,208
I don't want to die!

836
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:08,833
That's the price
you have to pay for your wealth!

837
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:10,833
Why?

838
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,208
Why me?

839
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:15,333
If you don't replace me
as the Fairy Godfather,

840
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:16,708
I won't be able to reincarnate!

841
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,125
That's none of my business.

842
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:23,083
You chose to eat at the place I jumped.

843
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:24,750
And you even took the book home!

844
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:27,291
You were the guy
who jumped off the building?

845
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:32,541
Your reward is to become my replacement!

846
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:34,666
Do I have to die now?

847
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,916
No, that was just a warning.

848
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,625
You are unlucky,
but you should live until 60!

849
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:42,500
But I made you rich and you became greedy.

850
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:45,000
So your lifespan has been shortened.

851
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:47,541
You only have one month left to live now.

852
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:49,500
One month?

853
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:50,958
That's how it is.

854
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,791
This is the rule of the book.

855
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:54,791
The more you gain from the book,

856
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,583
the shorter your life will be.

857
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:02,625
David.

858
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:05,750
What?

859
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,333
My house is sold?

860
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,833
You made me a profit of RM200,000?

861
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,125
Thank you.

862
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:18,875
Thank you for making me richer.

863
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:28,333
Do I really have just one month left?

864
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,875
Sorry, you just made another fortune.

865
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:34,375
You're now left with three weeks!

866
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:35,708
Three weeks?

867
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:43,250
What?

868
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,916
My stock made an RM300,000 profit?

869
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,375
Handsome, go do what you have to do

870
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:54,166
before it's too late!

871
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,750
Take care, bye.

872
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,791
Mr. Lim, your Singapore shares rose

873
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:02,916
by 40 times!

874
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,166
The Middle Eastern bosses
are rewarding your good service

875
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,125
with an RM500,000 commission!

876
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:09,166
Boss, we just signed Jeremy Lin!

877
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,458
We're going to be filthy rich!

878
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,791
Run Fa!

879
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:07,875
Run Fa!

880
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:32,458
Open the door!

881
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:39,375
You also met one?

882
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:44,500
So? What do we do now?

883
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:48,541
This should be able to help for a while.

884
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:50,291
Will it really work?

885
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,583
Will it really work?

886
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:24,666
It should be fine, right?

887
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:27,500
It should be fine.

888
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:29,583
Is it really fine?

889
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,125
Hey, come out! What are you doing inside?

890
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,625
It's all your fault we suffered so much!

891
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:50,583
What? What's wrong with my face?

892
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:15,750
It's all your fault!

893
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,416
You have nothing better to do!

894
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,625
You stole from the dead!

895
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:23,375
Now you got my head shaved by a ghost!

896
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:28,166
Don't blame me! It's Dao Mei's fault.

897
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:31,000
I wouldn't have flared up
if he didn't curse us.

898
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:33,250
If I didn't flare up,
I wouldn't have stolen the things!

899
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,083
It's all his fault!

900
01:02:36,291 --> 01:02:38,416
We can no longer live here. What do we do?

901
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:42,125
Call that idiot.

902
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:43,500
He has a condominium.

903
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,041
We should all move in.

904
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:47,000
We'll live there for a year or two!

905
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:57,958
Hello. The line is busy, please wait.

906
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:15,000
Satisfied?

907
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:18,333
You've been to France
and visited the Eiffel Tower.

908
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:20,458
Can you finally rest in peace?

909
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:27,708
If I say I can't,

910
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:29,958
can I die later?

911
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:33,041
There are still many places
I have not been to.

912
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,916
Have you been to the moon then?

913
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:39,208
Do you want to visit the moon fairy?

914
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:40,666
No, thank you!

915
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,375
The moon fairy
will most likely be you anyway.

916
01:03:43,458 --> 01:03:45,416
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

917
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,041
I got a call.

918
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:50,666
MISSED CALLS FROM CINDY AND JIA HUI

919
01:03:57,791 --> 01:03:58,916
Jia Hui.

920
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:05,416
Run Fa.

921
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:11,375
Cindy.

922
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,625
Why are you in such a bad state?

923
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,958
There are ghosts here.

924
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:43,666
A lot of them!

925
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:46,791
It's Madam Butterfly.
She locked us in here.

926
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:48,750
It's all his fault!

927
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,708
He stole from the dead.

928
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:52,833
What Madam Butterfly?

929
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:55,500
She's a female ghost.

930
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:59,791
She would touch me every night.

931
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:02,791
She would touch me here and there.

932
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,958
Sometimes, even here!

933
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,916
It's very scary!

934
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:09,583
Whenever she touches us,

935
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:12,208
we would have a butterfly marking
on our body.

936
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:13,625
-Look.
-Look.

937
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:16,791
There are some on my arm

938
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,541
and some on my head.

939
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:20,583
There's more. I--

940
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,583
Hey!

941
01:05:21,666 --> 01:05:23,458
You don't have to show him!

942
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:26,666
I think we should seek professional help.

943
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:32,041
YING, THE ONE BROW MASTER

944
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:34,750
CHEE, THE MONKEY KING MEDIUM

945
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:37,083
MADAM ANNIHILATE, THE IMPERIAL NUN

946
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,875
PROMISE, THE HOLY LAMA

947
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:54,083
Do you think they are powerful?

948
01:05:57,208 --> 01:06:00,291
SCRIPTURE

949
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:01,583
Run Fa.

950
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,958
Stop touching me.
There's a lot of people here.

951
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:06,458
I didn't touch you.

952
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,708
Don't look at me.

953
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:14,250
It can't be me.

954
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:24,500
What are they doing?

955
01:07:08,916 --> 01:07:10,125
You are too naive.

956
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:12,041
Will hiring some clowns
to perform magic tricks

957
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:13,875
be enough to appease me?

958
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:15,208
I'm Madam Butterfly.

959
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:16,750
Whatever debt you owe must be paid,

960
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,458
whatever wrong you've done
must be avenged.

961
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:21,416
When Madam Butterfly strikes,
no one can live!

962
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,250
You were the ones who stole my things
and broke my arm.

963
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,958
Now you're getting help to attack me?

964
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:31,166
Where is the justice?

965
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:44,250
But we already apologized at your grave.

966
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:47,958
Apologized? Listen well.

967
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:50,208
In our Butterfly Clan,

968
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:51,916
if someone steals,

969
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,375
we would chop off their arms.

970
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:56,750
If they break our brother's hand,
we would chop off all of their limbs!

971
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,291
But we're not members
of your Butterfly Clan.

972
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:02,833
If you guys are not members,
then you're the enemies!

973
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,791
Madam Butterfly, we know we're wrong.

974
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:12,291
But why only hit me

975
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:14,583
when he is the one talking

976
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:16,000
and stealing from you?

977
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:19,416
Don't you know
how loan sharks collect debts?

978
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,333
You're his best friend.

979
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:24,708
Did you stop him when he stole from me?

980
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:29,000
Did you not feast with the money he made
from the things he stole?

981
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:32,750
-Don't I deserve to hit you?
-Don't I deserve to hit you?

982
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,000
Don't I deserve to hit you?

983
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,375
Crap.

984
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:05,583
I just wanted to share my wealth.

985
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:07,208
Can you just shut up?

986
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:09,000
Do you think my face
is not swollen enough?

987
01:09:09,833 --> 01:09:11,000
Madam Butterfly.

988
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,750
We know we're in the wrong.

989
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:17,083
How will you forgive us?

990
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:19,583
Return all the things you stole from me!

991
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,125
I am only left with this pendant.

992
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,291
I've already sold the rest.

993
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:31,000
Then all of you have to die!

994
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,041
I'll give you a lifeline.

995
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:49,750
By right, if you become poor again

996
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:52,833
before your deadline,

997
01:09:52,916 --> 01:09:55,291
you should be spared.

998
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:59,333
But by left, it depends
if you have good fortune.

999
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:01,791
Good luck to you, handsome.

1000
01:10:38,916 --> 01:10:41,333
Mister, this is your bag, right?

1001
01:10:44,291 --> 01:10:46,041
There's a lot of money in it.

1002
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:48,291
Is it?

1003
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:50,375
Don't flaunt your fortune, mister.

1004
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:53,166
It's very dangerous. You might get robbed.

1005
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,583
Here you go. Don't lose it again.

1006
01:10:58,333 --> 01:10:59,333
Be careful.

1007
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:02,291
Be careful.

1008
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:45,333
That's a lot of money.

1009
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:47,458
Could it be ransom money
for some kidnappers?

1010
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:49,375
-I think so.
-Could this be a movie shoot?

1011
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:52,166
Don't take any.
There must be police somewhere. Let's go!

1012
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,916
It must be some candid camera TV show.

1013
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,833
It's so embarrassing to be seen! Run!

1014
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:24,208
Who says men are greedy?

1015
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:29,125
No one picked up any of the money I threw!

1016
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,291
Do you want to make a donation?

1017
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:54,416
CHAPTER FOUR, GREEDY VERSUS DEATH

1018
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,166
IS THERE KARMA?

1019
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:11,833
Will ten lorries each of gold and silver
be enough?

1020
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:13,708
Shut up!

1021
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:16,750
If the master says it will work,
then it will work!

1022
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:21,250
I hope everything will be fine
after this praying ceremony.

1023
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:25,500
There are RM200,000 worth
of hell notes to be burned.

1024
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:27,375
I'm sure we'll all be fine!

1025
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:41,083
Sorry, ma'am.

1026
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:45,291
I am Cindy. I never went to school.

1027
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:48,625
I am young and ignorant.

1028
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:52,958
Please forgive us
and stop caressing my butt!

1029
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Madam Butterfly.

1030
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:57,416
I am Liang Jia Hui,

1031
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,666
a vegetarian who never commits any crimes.

1032
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:04,666
Not stopping Run Fa
when he stole your jewelry

1033
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:05,875
is my fault.

1034
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:08,083
I hope you will forgive me.

1035
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:09,666
Madam Butterfly.

1036
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,791
I, Zou Run Fa,

1037
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:15,291
brought ten lorries of gold and silver

1038
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:16,833
to beg for your forgiveness.

1039
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:18,750
I hope that you will forgive us.

1040
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:21,458
Also, I hope you would bless me,

1041
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:24,000
so that I can strike the jackpot again!

1042
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:26,541
Then I won't disturb you anymore.

1043
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,541
-Thank you!
-Are you nuts?

1044
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:30,458
Why are you still spouting rubbish?

1045
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:32,625
Come on.

1046
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:35,708
Since Dao Mei is paying for the ceremony,

1047
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:38,291
we might as well make full use of it.

1048
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:41,000
As long as we're safe, whatever goes.

1049
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:43,875
There are more than RM200,000 worth
of hell notes here.

1050
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:45,916
Everyone will be fine.

1051
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:49,041
Master, you may begin.

1052
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,166
Okay.

1053
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:52,250
God bless.

1054
01:14:58,083 --> 01:14:59,458
It won't burn.

1055
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:01,208
Is the dead unwilling to accept them?

1056
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,916
Madam Butterfly, we're so sorry.

1057
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,291
I beg for your forgiveness
for Run Fa's nonsense.

1058
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:12,333
We are going to burn ten lorries
of gold and silver for you.

1059
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:14,791
Please bless us. Please.

1060
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:16,166
We are sorry.

1061
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:30,250
Do you think us ghosts
would be so forgiving?

1062
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:33,541
But we have already returned
the money to you!

1063
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:37,666
There is a price for being greedy!

1064
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:09,250
I'm so sorry!

1065
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:11,375
Can you please not touch me anymore?

1066
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,083
Stupid woman!

1067
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:20,541
How could you be
with this unworthy lousy idiot?

1068
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:23,208
Why don't you come with me?

1069
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:28,083
Hurry!

1070
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:42,416
Hey, what are you doing? Let go!

1071
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,500
Let go!

1072
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:45,416
Are you rebelling?

1073
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,333
Let go!

1074
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:49,041
Let go or I'll hit you!

1075
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:54,500
Let go?

1076
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:56,250
I was thinking of chopping your arms off!

1077
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:05,583
Madam Butterfly, I'm sorry.

1078
01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:07,666
I won't do it anymore.

1079
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:16,208
If you like my girlfriend's body,

1080
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:17,666
you can have it.

1081
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:18,958
It's free of charge.

1082
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:21,875
Feel free to take it for any usage.

1083
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:23,208
I don't need it anymore!

1084
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:30,041
You heartless rascal!

1085
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:33,208
Rascal!

1086
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,708
You like burial items, don't you?

1087
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:42,416
I'll give you all of them!

1088
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,625
Burn him to death!

1089
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,291
No! I don't want to die!

1090
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:53,541
I'm sorry!

1091
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,416
Cindy, I know I'm wrong!

1092
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:11,291
Run Fa, what are you doing?

1093
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:14,666
Where is Madam Butterfly?

1094
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:17,333
Do you want to meet Madam Butterfly?
I'll tell her to come.

1095
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:19,041
No!

1096
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:21,333
Quick, pray.

1097
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:22,416
Hurry!

1098
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,125
The hell notes are for burning,

1099
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:28,208
not for decoration.

1100
01:18:29,625 --> 01:18:30,875
-Hurry!
-Is it ready?

1101
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:37,958
-Master, you may proceed.
-Okay.

1102
01:18:38,791 --> 01:18:39,875
Master.

1103
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:44,791
Can you help me burn this as well?

1104
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:46,666
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1105
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:53,625
Master, please help me burn
this jade pendant as well.

1106
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:58,666
Madam Butterfly, I have returned
everything to you now!

1107
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,125
Don't haunt us anymore!

1108
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:12,791
-It's gone!
-What's gone?

1109
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:14,791
Your butterfly markings are gone!

1110
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:19,125
-It's gone!
-Hey, it's gone!

1111
01:19:19,208 --> 01:19:21,041
-It's gone!
-Everything's fine now!

1112
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,458
Thank you!

1113
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:25,666
Bless us.

1114
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:48,666
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1115
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,666
We finally escaped from the hauntings!

1116
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,375
Here's to our new life.

1117
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,916
-Yes!
-Yes!

1118
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,041
I'm also back to poverty!

1119
01:19:58,125 --> 01:19:59,791
-Yes!
-Yes!

1120
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,250
Let's eat.

1121
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:02,916
There's prawn here!

1122
01:20:03,791 --> 01:20:06,708
After the ghosts left,
my hair is starting to grow again. Look.

1123
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:11,958
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1124
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:13,458
Come to think of it,

1125
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:15,666
isn't life

1126
01:20:16,916 --> 01:20:18,791
very weird?

1127
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:22,708
When I was poor,

1128
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:26,125
I always dreamt of making it rich.

1129
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:29,291
When my pockets were empty,

1130
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:33,208
I felt so pitiful

1131
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:34,625
and sad.

1132
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:40,291
But when I got rich,

1133
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:44,500
I kept worrying every day.

1134
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,333
But now, look.

1135
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,916
My account is empty.

1136
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:55,916
I'm penniless.

1137
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:58,458
But here we are,

1138
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:01,625
drinking and celebrating!

1139
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:04,625
Don't you think

1140
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:07,666
life is strange?

1141
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,000
-Come.
-Come.

1142
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,541
Let's drink.

1143
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:15,500
Let me tell you.

1144
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:20,125
Life is more valuable than money.

1145
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:23,875
Although you are broke,

1146
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:25,541
you managed to keep your life.

1147
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:27,916
It's worth it!

1148
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:32,083
That's why Jia Hui always says…

1149
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:34,958
-If it's yours, it's yours.
-If it's yours, it's yours.

1150
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:39,166
-If it's not, it's not!
-If it's not, it's not!

1151
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:42,541
Come.

1152
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:44,458
The charity show is going to start soon.

1153
01:21:44,541 --> 01:21:45,583
What charity?

1154
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:47,708
It's a TV show.

1155
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:51,833
Donators will stand a chance
to win a house worth RM800,000!

1156
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:55,958
-I donated RM5!
-It's finally time for our lucky draw!

1157
01:21:56,041 --> 01:22:00,375
-Yes, it's our turn to come up!
-Quick, let's see if I'll win.

1158
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:03,083
I am Jeremy, Guo Liang.

1159
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:07,875
Guo as in rice pot,
Liang as in shining like a shoe.

1160
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:09,750
My name is Wang Fei.

1161
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:12,791
Wang as in queen, and Fei as in fly.

1162
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:15,750
And I already have the winner's name
in my hand!

1163
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:20,125
The winner will win a mansion
worth over RM800,000!

1164
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:21,333
That's right!

1165
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:24,208
So how much did he donate?

1166
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:27,583
He donated a lot of money.

1167
01:22:27,666 --> 01:22:29,333
How much is a lot?

1168
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:30,583
He has donated…

1169
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:35,375
one million ringgit!

1170
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:39,583
Do you want to make a donation?

1171
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:40,750
How much should I donate?

1172
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:42,666
Any amount as you wish.

1173
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,916
It's up to your sincerity.

1174
01:22:47,916 --> 01:22:49,125
You can have all of this.

1175
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:53,583
Donate a million
and get an RM800,000 mansion?

1176
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:55,458
He is such a philanthropist!

1177
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:58,041
Look! This is so lame!

1178
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:00,708
Who would donate a million
to get an RM800,000 house?

1179
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:03,208
Stop teasing. Who is this winner?

1180
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:04,708
Let me bring him onto the show.

1181
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:08,041
In the studio? Then it can't be me!

1182
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:12,583
He did not come to the studio,
but we are here below his block!

1183
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:16,416
That's right, we are getting closer
to the winner's house!

1184
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:18,750
Isn't that our block?

1185
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:22,125
-Tenth floor?
-And there's no lift.

1186
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:23,333
No lift?

1187
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:25,291
Just kidding. Let's go.

1188
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:27,708
We are over-running into the news!

1189
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:29,833
That's right, let's go have a look.

1190
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:31,291
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1191
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:34,958
There can't be such a coincidence.

1192
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:35,958
Don't scare me!

1193
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:38,083
No, I'm not…

1194
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:40,208
Don't tell me

1195
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:43,458
you are that idiot.

1196
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:46,041
They stay here, but they have one million!

1197
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:48,916
Hey, they are really on our floor!

1198
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:51,083
We're almost there!

1199
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:52,375
This is so nervous.

1200
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:54,666
Hopefully, the winner is a hunk!

1201
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:55,958
Give us some hints.

1202
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:59,125
I'll give you a hint. His surname is Lim.

1203
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:05,541
The winner is your neighbor, Mr. Lim!

1204
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:08,666
Congratulations to Mr. Lim Jun Jie!

1205
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:15,916
Hi, ma'am. Is Mr. Lim Jun Jie home?

1206
01:24:16,708 --> 01:24:18,791
Yes, I'm Ms. Lim Jun Jie.

1207
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:21,375
It's a woman.

1208
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:24,666
Can't a woman be named Lim Jun Jie?

1209
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:26,666
Of course, you can!

1210
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,250
That's a very nice name!

1211
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,000
I thought we won!

1212
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:34,750
It would be a disaster
if Dao Mei really won!

1213
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:38,166
That's right. As long as Dao Mei is poor,
everything will be fine!

1214
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:43,041
-Dao Me is safe!
-Everything is fine!

1215
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:46,500
-I didn't win the prize!
-Yes!

1216
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:49,500
-I didn't win the prize!
-What should we buy?

1217
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:52,000
Beer!

1218
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:55,625
Also roast meat, roast chicken,
and roast duck.

1219
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:57,708
Are you nuts?
We're celebrating, not praying!

1220
01:24:57,791 --> 01:25:00,166
-But those are very good!
-Buy them!

1221
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:01,375
What happened?

1222
01:25:08,541 --> 01:25:09,416
Dao Mei.

1223
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:12,833
Dao Mei.

1224
01:25:19,166 --> 01:25:20,333
What happened?

1225
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:22,666
He stopped breathing.

1226
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:29,125
THE LATEST PHILANTHROPIST IS IN TOWN

1227
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:31,125
Besides, I once heard

1228
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:34,458
these vendors on wheelchairs
are often conmen.

1229
01:25:34,541 --> 01:25:36,833
-You…
-I'm leaving.

1230
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:38,916
Dao Mei!

1231
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:42,291
On second thought,

1232
01:25:43,291 --> 01:25:45,333
you're right.

1233
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:46,958
I should do more charity.

1234
01:25:47,666 --> 01:25:49,916
That's right, let's buy them.

1235
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:00,000
Dao Mei!

1236
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:02,750
-Miss, I want to buy lottery tickets.
-Hi, sir.

1237
01:26:02,833 --> 01:26:04,875
-How many do you want?
-Ten pieces.

1238
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:06,833
-Sure.
-Here.

1239
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:08,208
Thank you, sir!

1240
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:17,708
The more you gain from the book,

1241
01:26:17,791 --> 01:26:19,208
the shorter your life will be.

1242
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:21,958
This is the rule of the book.

1243
01:26:43,125 --> 01:26:44,333
One and a half ball.

1244
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:46,166
Manchester United?

1245
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:49,208
It's a sure win!
Two to two and a half ball.

1246
01:26:50,291 --> 01:26:51,875
I'm a bluff?

1247
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:53,416
I make you lose money?

1248
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:57,958
It may be your own issue, you know?

1249
01:26:58,041 --> 01:26:59,583
Fine, stop disturbing my peace.

1250
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:10,000
This is heavy.

1251
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:14,166
It must be a big catch! Come to me!

1252
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:24,625
What is this?

1253
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:37,250
What? A book?

1254
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:39,500
How am I going to bet in the future?

1255
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:59,500
These are the winners
of this week's matches!

1256
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:01,000
Go bet on them.

1257
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:02,166
It's a sure win!

1258
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,333
Really?

1259
01:28:05,958 --> 01:28:07,125
A sure win?

1260
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:13,083
A sure win?

1261
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:08,541
I can't believe
Dao Mei actually had insurance.

1262
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:12,291
It's hard to believe that his beneficiary

1263
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:14,166
could get RM10,000,000!

1264
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:16,416
It's RM10,000,000!

1265
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:22,500
I never thought that his beneficiary
would not be me!

1266
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:25,000
Yes, it's Jia Hui. It's the same!

1267
01:29:25,083 --> 01:29:26,541
Shit!

1268
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:30,208
Why am I always left out
from the good stuff?

1269
01:29:30,291 --> 01:29:32,750
That's enough! Stop cursing.

1270
01:29:32,833 --> 01:29:35,958
Me getting the RM10,000,000
is the same as you getting it.

1271
01:29:36,041 --> 01:29:37,375
The most important thing is,

1272
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:39,708
how do we spend the money?

1273
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:44,583
Since we're here,
we should get a new place!

1274
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:46,750
Are we here for hot pot?

1275
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:22,916
What are you doing here?

1276
01:30:24,041 --> 01:30:27,250
It's always a good time to diet
when you're poor.

1277
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:31,000
It's such a waste
to leave all these fruits here.

1278
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:34,708
A fruit a day keeps the doctors away.

1279
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:37,958
Are you really that poor?

1280
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:39,416
Yes, I am.

1281
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,041
Now that I can't see the numbers,
I can't win the jackpot.

1282
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:46,250
When I can't win the jackpot,
I don't have money!

1283
01:30:46,333 --> 01:30:49,250
If I eat a piece of bread for every meal,

1284
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:54,041
it can last me until next week!

1285
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:57,875
You must finish this water
made from flower petals.

1286
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,333
The four of us?

1287
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:01,875
Not the four of you together.

1288
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:03,666
One must finish a barrel each.

1289
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:08,083
Hang these on your body
and you will be blessed.

1290
01:31:08,166 --> 01:31:09,250
Absolutely blessed!

1291
01:31:32,791 --> 01:31:35,375
I've bought a lot.
Are you just here to watch?

1292
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:38,458
All of them are very beautiful.

1293
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:40,125
I don't know which one to get.

1294
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:43,833
Can I buy all of them?

1295
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:49,000
If you do more charity,
you will be blessed.

1296
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,875
Our temple looks a little old.

1297
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:55,083
If all of you could…

1298
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,375
You are bound to be blessed eternally.

1299
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:05,208
I've given you the numbers.

1300
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:07,041
Aren't you going to bet?

1301
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:11,541
I've given you the numbers.
Aren't you going to bet?

1302
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:15,000
Yes, I'm talking to you. Place your bet!

1303
01:32:15,916 --> 01:32:18,166
But not from illegal vendors!

1304
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:20,250
Only then will you win!
