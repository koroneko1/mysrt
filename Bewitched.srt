1
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,515
-It's perfect.
-Oh great!

2
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:31,419
-I'll take it!
-Oh, wonderful! It's just...
There's one thing.

3
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,722
-I'm going to need
some references.
-I don't have any of those.

4
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:39,327
Oh dear. That's serious.
I don't know that we can
do business together.

5
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,195
if you don't have references.

6
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,767
Bye, now!

7
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,753
-Daddy...
-What's going on, Isabel?

8
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,423
(SIGHS)
I'm moving here.

9
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,825
To the Valley?
Why on earth
would you do that?

10
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,894
Because it's normal.

11
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,163
-You're normal. You're just...
-I know. But I'm not going to
be one anymore.

12
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,466
You have no choice
in the matter.
It's what you are.

13
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,602
Orange is a great color.
Orange is happy.

14
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,637
Happy?
Why don't we just
paint it yellow?

15
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,806
We can't paint it yellow.
We're going to
paint the bathroom yellow.

16
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,408
Since when are we
painting the bathroom yellow?

17
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,611
-They're arguing about paint.
-Yes, I can see that.

18
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,847
-I want to argue about paint.
-With whom?

19
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,550
-With someone.
-A man?

20
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,452
-Yes!
-Oh Isabel...

21
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,721
I'm through with warlocks.
They're all just like you.

22
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,525
Even when you and Mother were
married, you were always
casting spells on other women.

23
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,928
Your life is total
instant gratification, Daddy.

24
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,498
-It's fantastic, isn't it?
-No, no it's not, because
how do you know that

25
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,700
anyone really loves you
for yourself?

26
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,270
It's like those rich men who
are never really sure
why women sleep with them.

27
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:34,542
But women sleep with them,
so it's not really a problem.

28
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,346
-I want a man who needs me.
-Needs you?

29
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:43,216
-Mm hmm. Because he is a
completely hopeless mess.

30
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,219
Oh, no. You're talking
about love, aren't you?

31
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,122
-What do you suppose
it's like?

32
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,159
Oh, it's simple. You say,
"I love you" to someone you
want to go home with.

33
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:56,263
And then when things
get messy, you say,
"I don't love you anymore."

34
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,902
-And that's pretty much it.
-I feel as if I'm pressed
against a glass window.

35
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:06,907
It's right there on the other
side. I can see it,
but I can't feel it.

36
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,609
I can't touch it.

37
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:12,980
-Does your mother know
about this?
-She disappeared again.

38
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,950
CASHIER: $420.56.
-Money. Money.

39
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,395
That was my last thing
as a witch.

40
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,300
I want to be like everyone
else. I want to have friends
and I want to...

41
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,870
And I want to go to the Coffee
Bean, where we all discuss our
problems,

42
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,006
which are absolutely
unsolvable.

43
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:43,276
You can have anything you
want. Every woman
wants to be a witch.

44
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,347
I don't. I want to feel
thwarted. I want days where my
hair is affected by weather.

45
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:50,951
-Yeah, hi, what can I get you?
-Scrambled eggs, please.

46
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,855
I am through with just
snapping my fingers
and getting my way.

47
00:05:54,922 --> 00:06:03,096
-No breakfast after 11.
-Oh.
My absolutely last thing.

48
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:08,068
Don't do this. You'll meet
someone, you'll get this close
and when he finds out about...

49
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,838
If he loves me,
he won't care.

50
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,607
I'm going to get an umbrella.

51
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:22,215
-Go on. Get yourself one.
-No, Daddy. No. I mean it.
No. Never again.

52
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,285
-You'll get wet.
-I hope so.

53
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,938
I know what you're
going to say.
I'm a mess.

54
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,875
-Get a grip, Jack.
Get a grip.
-I can't help it.

55
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:51,979
-Hey, how do I look?
-You look great.

56
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,681
-I look great?
-Yeah!

57
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,149
I always look great.
That's a given.
And the important thing is...

58
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,487
-What?
-I have no idea what the
important thing is.

59
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,756
I'm telling you, I feel like
I'm about to
go out of my mind.

60
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:07,394
You know, I want my life back.
Okay? I want my wife
and my house.

61
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:11,164
I want to be a movie star
again. I mean, what the
hell happened, Richie?

62
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,000
Things were going so great
there for a while.

63
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,268
-Last Year in Katmandu
-Oh don't bring it up.

64
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:20,273
It cost $140 mill to make and
grossed 1.6 - the only DVD
to sell no copies.

65
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,409
We probably shouldn't have
shot it in black-and-white.

66
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,779
But now you're going to do
a television series and it's
going to be a big hit.

67
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,949
So pull yourself together,
man, because you look like
Don Johnson,

68
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,651
but in a bad way.

69
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:32,653
-Ok, I got it,
I'll pull myself together.
-Ok? Let's go.

70
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,589
-And don't get all nice on me.
Be mean.
-Going to be mean.

71
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,091
OK?
Be mean. Be mean.
Hit me.

72
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,795
There you go. You're the
Jackerator, baby.
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

73
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:45,165
-Yo, gentlemen.
How are you? Oh!
-Hey, hello!

74
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,900
-Jack Wyatt
-Hi, I'm Jack.

75
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,603
-Huge fan, huge.
-How are the kids, guys?

76
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,071
-Good.
-Great!

77
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,473
-Good. Good. Well, let's cut
the chitchat.
-I'm Jack, by the way.

78
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,809
-Nina.
-Jack wants to do the show.

79
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,578
-That's great.
-I want to do it.

80
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:00,714
-Great. That's terrific.
-He only has one concern.

81
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:05,553
We have the same concern.
We think everyone's forgotten
about Last Year in Katmandu.

82
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:11,291
-Unless they saw it.
-His concern is, the witch has
all the fun.

83
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:15,696
-You will be fun.
-We're changing it
from the original.

84
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:19,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't all go crazy.
Okay? I mean, it is Bewitched.

85
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:25,138
I mean, Samantha, she should
be strong, right?
This should be a two-hander.

86
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,441
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God. Huh?
Hey. What a relief.

87
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,445
I was worried because Larry
told me you'd want us to tilt
the entire show towards you...

88
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,615
-No, no, no.
-Stu, Stu.

89
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,918
We've got to have a great
ensemble is what I'm thinking.
You know?

90
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:41,454
Endora, the next-door
neighbors, all those
crazy family members.

91
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,892
Who's going to play Uncle
Arthur? Huh?
I used to love Uncle Arthur.

92
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,127
Well, we're looking for
Uncle Arthur.

93
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,996
-Your table's ready.
-Thank you.

94
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,565
I don't know if you guys
remember this, but when he'd
appear in the mirror

95
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:54,768
it would crack,
it would always crack.
And you knew it was coming,

96
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:59,640
and yet, every time it
happened, I laughed
and I laughed and I laughed.

97
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,374
-Can I talk to you
for a second?
-I loved it!

98
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,443
-Can I talk to you?
-"Hiya, Sammy."

99
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,214
One second, fellows.
We'll meet you guys
at the table, all right?

100
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,919
-Hey, I like those guys.
What?
-You're being a pussy.

101
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:15,022
-What?
-You're being a pussy, pussy,
pussy, pussy, pussy!

102
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:18,025
-No, I'm not!
I want the show to be good.
-You want the show to be...?

103
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:22,562
You know what, Jack Wyatt's
doing TV now because
his film career ate it!

104
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,299
And he's not even the clear
star of his own show.
Jack, screw Uncle Arthur.

105
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:30,070
-Hell, screw ensembles, man.
-I'm being a pussy.

106
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:33,741
Yes. If this show tanks,
you'll be the bottom right
square on Hollywood Squares

107
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,177
for the next 10 years.
You will also be the mayor
of Pussytown. You read me?

108
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,979
I don't want to be the mayor
of Pussytown.

109
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,082
No, get in there and be
the sheriff of Ballsville,
all right?

110
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,553
-Ok.
-Bring it! Let's go!

111
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,390
-Stop that.
-Sorry. Sorry.

112
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,826
Sorry, guys, where were we?

113
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:56,396
A couple of big names
are available for Samantha.

114
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,367
-To hell with that.
-Yeah.

115
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,637
I want an unknown in the lead.
All right? A hot new face
that's going to

116
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:09,009
look good and set me up.
Because I have worked
my ass off to the bone

117
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:13,681
for too long to build up
the brand value
of the name Jack Wyatt!

118
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,185
-This show has one star.
-And I want three trailers.

119
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:22,122
-Nobody in television
has three trailers.
-He wants them, you get them.

120
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:26,694
And I want my own personal
makeup team
in matching jumpsuits.

121
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,699
And a leopard! I want a pet
leopard. With a diamond-
studded collar. Real diamonds.

122
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:35,402
-That's enough, Jack.
-And a cake.
A two-story-high cake.

123
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,637
Every Wednesday's Cake Day.

124
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,974
And we're going to bring it
out and we're going to
pretend it's a surprise,

125
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,677
because it's Cake Day.
-We get it, Jack.

126
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:47,881
If we have a leopard, we're
going to have major
insurance issues.

127
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:51,518
-Well, we're willing to give
on the leopard.
-It's getting hard to breathe.

128
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,721
-Should I be
writing this down?
-No.

129
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:58,191
So this should be fun.
Huh? Right?

130
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,593
Gosh, I used to have
the biggest crush on
Elizabeth Montgomery

131
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,196
when I was 10 years old.
-We all did.

132
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:07,634
The nose! I mean...

133
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:12,605
It's not going to be easy
finding a nobody
to play Samantha.

134
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,275
Be the sheriff.

135
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:19,479
Well, Jack Wyatt says
get it done, y'all.

136
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:29,289
Hey! I'm turning on
the sprinklers
in my front yard!

137
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,428
Dimming up...

138
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,465
Dimming down...

139
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,869
Dimming up...

140
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,205
Dimming down...

141
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,880
Wow!

142
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:57,484
I don't think you quite
understand.
This is very confusing.

143
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,757
I put the black cable in the
red plug like they said
and the screen is still blue.

144
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:07,194
(DOORBELL)
I'm here to give you cable.

145
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,363
Oh, thank you,
I already have some.

146
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,732
Hello? Don't go away, please.

147
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,971
Oh, to heck with
all this bunk!

148
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,896
There.

149
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:47,700
Hmm. Let's just keep this
between us, Lucinda.

150
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,738
Is your self-esteem low
because you aren't

151
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,740
participating in
the real world?

152
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,642
-Yes, my self-esteem
is very low.

153
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,246
Well, let's face it,
you need a job.

154
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,414
There's something I
have to tell you, Darrin.

155
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,749
I'm a witch.

156
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,051
I'm a witch.

157
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,353
I am a witch.

158
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,899
Good.
Good.

159
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,931
Oh my goodness.

160
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,646
(SNEEZES)
God bless you.

161
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:48,188
Don't look, but
Jack Wyatt is
staring at you.

162
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,994
My heart's pounding,
and I am feeling
very weird tingles.

163
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:58,398
-I know.
He makes me sick, too.
-You know him?

164
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:03,136
Jack Wyatt, the actor?
Huh.
Where have you been?

165
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:06,506
-May I join you?
-Uh, sure!

166
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,243
-Hi, I'm Jack Wyatt.
-I know.

167
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,182
Thank you.
Look, I've never done this
before.

168
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:21,654
-How would you like to be
on a television show? Miss...
-Bigelow.

169
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,856
-Bigelow?
-Mm hmm.

170
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,860
-Isabel Bigelow.
-Oh.

171
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,997
So what do you think?
Do you want to want to be
a famous actress?

172
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,900
-Me? An actress?
-Yeah.

173
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:39,973
-I can't act.
-Oh, anyone can act. If I
can act, you can act.

174
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,042
Amen.

175
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:46,313
You know, I think those people
over there just finished their
plate of hummus.

176
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,649
You might want to help them
by clearing it.
Thank you.

177
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:57,824
-So, Isabel Bigelow.
Do you have a job?
-No.

178
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,130
-Are you rich? Because I am.
(LAUGHS)
I'm extremely wealthy.

179
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:08,635
Which I'm about to prove
to you by taking care of this
bill for

180
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:13,373
two dollars and 31 cents.

181
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,309
-Wow!
-Yeah. Wow is right.

182
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:20,280
-I have to remember to get
some money.
-Yeah.

183
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,949
So, do you want to be
rich and famous?

184
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:31,191
-I just want to be normal.
-Well, acting is
better than normal.

185
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:36,163
You get to pretend to be
normal. And if you're good,
you become a big star

186
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:39,166
and guess what happens?
-What?

187
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:43,070
You snap your fingers and
pretty much anything you want
materializes

188
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:48,075
Oh no. No no no no. No.
I have that now.
It's what I'm giving up.

189
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:53,246
Oh, um, it was
lovely to meet you.

190
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:57,984
You seem very sweet and
unkempt and
troubled.

191
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:05,892
Hey! Hey hey hey hey.
Those are bad things to say
to a person.

192
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:10,597
Oh no they aren't. I think the
fact that you're a hopeless
mess is very refreshing.

193
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,600
It moves me.

194
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:22,475
-Isabel Bigelow.
-Yes?

195
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,913
-I need you.
-What did you say?

196
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,516
-I said I need you.
-You need me.

197
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:35,322
I need you.
You don't have to
come audition.

198
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,325
Just come and show everyone
what you look like
when you do it.

199
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,426
Like this?

200
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,395
-Uncanny.
-It's identical.

201
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,496
I told you.

202
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:47,267
(APPLAUSE)

203
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,504
(MORE APPLAUSE)

204
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:01,414
We would just like you to
read the script. Start on page
13, should be marked there.

205
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,683
-Read it?
-Mm hmm.

206
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:16,463
-Okay, out loud.
-Yeah, we just want to get an
idea what it could sound like.

207
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:25,538
-Uh, int honeymoon suite
night, uh, dash night
-That one's not too bright.

208
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:30,677
Just, uh, just read the
part that says "Samantha."

209
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:34,647
Um,
"Darrin, I know it's our
honeymoon but there's

210
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:39,219
"something I have to tell you.
I'm a witch."
I'm not a witch!

211
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:42,955
-Yeah, exactly.
No, you're giving it up.
-Who told you?

212
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:46,159
You're about to,
on the next page.

213
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:49,662
It's Bewitched, the TV show?
We're redoing it.

214
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,432
Oh, I wasn't allowed to watch
Bewitched. I...

215
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:56,969
(LAUGHING) Who wasn't allowed
to watch Bewitched?
-That's great, Jack!

216
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:02,575
That's great. Well, I play a
mortal, and I'm in love
with you, and I don't care

217
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,444
that you're a witch.

218
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:09,616
-You don't care? No?
Is that true?
-Yes, it is. Yeah.

219
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,719
Now go ahead and
read the lines.

220
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:16,756
I'll read with you, actually.
We'll do it together.
Randall, where are you?

221
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:21,461
-Yes, thank you.
This will be easy.
-Mm hmm.

222
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,067
-Here?
-Yeah.

223
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:31,638
"I'm a witch, Darrin. A real
house-haunting,
broomstick-flying,

224
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,774
"cauldron-stirring witch!"

225
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,211
Great. Ok.
You know what, let's
put the script down,

226
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,313
let's put it away and
we'll improvise.

227
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,418
-Jack? That was only one line.
-Mm. Not a big deal.
Go ahead, just set it down.

228
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:48,154
Randall...

229
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:52,191
Now, I'm going to ask you
questions, and you just answer
them as if you're a witch.

230
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:56,263
-Sure.
-Yeah. Uh, were your parents
in the witch business?

231
00:19:56,329 --> 00:20:01,234
-Both of them.
My mother fixed
the 1986 World Series.

232
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,736
-Funny!
-Um, make a note of that.

233
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:07,374
Do you carry around poison
apples, like in Snow White?

234
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,312
-Oh no, you have to have a
permit for a poison apple.
-Permit? Ok, good to know.

235
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,281
That's good.

236
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,249
Um, oh - what's it like to
date a warlock?

237
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:21,053
Oh, horrible! They're so
self-centered, not very
bright, and all that

238
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,293
"feel-good-in-the-moment," you
know? Not at all like you.
(GENERAL LAUGHTER)

239
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,429
-What's so funny?
-Nothing, J-Bone.

240
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,798
-Oh, what's your
favorite spell?

241
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,335
Oh no, I don't like to talk
about that because I'm
quitting, and...

242
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,737
No, talking about it
just makes it harder, so...

243
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,540
-Great.
-Are you sure you never saw
Bewitched?

244
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:44,176
-She's incredibly dialed-in.
-Can I ask a question?

245
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,879
-Sure.
-How much longer do we
have to do this for?

246
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:51,150
Oh, this? We're almost done
with this. I mean, if you do
the show,

247
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,985
we'll be together forever.

248
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,322
-You and I?
-Would you please do the show,
Isabel?

249
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,324
-What, this show?
-This show.

250
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:02,295
-The Bewitched show?
-Absolutely. We'll be working
together. We'll be partners.

251
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:05,197
-Be my TV wife.
-This is very complicated.

252
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:10,803
-Marry me.
Say yes!
-What are you doing, Isabel?

253
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,040
-Easy answer!
-Yes.

254
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,945
Yes!
Great, thank you!

255
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:23,650
Ok, let's make the deal.

256
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:28,421
Once upon a time, there was a
typical American girl...

257
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:33,726
...who happened to bump into
a typical, red-blooded
American boy.

258
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,962
And she bumped into him...

259
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,598
...and bumped into him.

260
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,733
(DOORBELL)

261
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,337
So they decided they'd better
sit down and talk this over
before they had an accident.

262
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,709
-Hi!
-Hello?

263
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,144
They delivered this while you
were out, and I said I'd
bring it over.

264
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:56,115
-I'm your neighbor,
Maria Kelly.
-Come in!

265
00:21:56,182 --> 00:22:00,286
-What is all this stuff?
-I just got the most
amazing job.

266
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:04,190
I'm going to be Samantha on
Bewitched!
They're re-doing it.

267
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,594
-Are you an actress?
-I guess I am.

268
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,797
-Oh, I love that show! Is that
the one about the genie?
-No?

269
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:14,000
This is so exciting!

270
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:20,272
Aah! There you are.
Come here. This is you!

271
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,710
Oh, I love this show!
(HUMS THE THEME)

272
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:29,015
-You know it?
-Watched it every night!
Love the song! Perfect!

273
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,918
There you are! You're great!
Look at the nose!

274
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,453
I hope you can do that.
That's hard.

275
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,221
Oh, that's how I got the job,
wriggling my nose.

276
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,490
-Really?
-Mm hmm, it's easy.

277
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,192
-Who's going to play
your husband?
-Jack Wyatt.

278
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,530
-Oh my God!
-He believes in me, he wants
to be partners with me.

279
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:47,099
Listen to this,
"Looking forward
to working with you, Isabel.

280
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,702
"As dictated to
Jack's assistant, Randall."

281
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:52,271
Isn't that amazing?

282
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:55,642
He's single.
It's in all the tabloids.
His wife dumped him.

283
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,976
-Is that true?
-Yes!

284
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:01,514
Oh my gosh!
(SQUEALS OF DELIGHT)

285
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:05,317
-I don't know why we're
doing this, but it's fun!
-I know!

286
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,455
Although, you really shouldn't
get involved with someone
you're working with.

287
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:11,858
They can destroy your
references. I'm a career
counselor, and...

288
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,427
Well that's the only reason
I took the job.

289
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:19,832
He is the cutest mess you have
ever seen. He is hopeless.
(DOORBELL)

290
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:26,973
Oh, gosh, he's beyond mortal.
My father would never approve.

291
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,642
Oh.

292
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:34,581
-I won't?
-Daddy. Hi.

293
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,549
(WHISPERING) What are you
doing here?

294
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:42,421
Hello, Isabel.
Love the hat.
And who is this?

295
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:45,658
This is my father.
This is Maria Kelly,

296
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:52,098
Woo hoo hoo, how witchy was
that? We talk about your
father and he turns up.

297
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:56,836
-Maria is my neighbor.
-Nigel Bigelow.
Enchante.

298
00:23:56,903 --> 00:24:00,940
-Oh, ok.
-And what won't I
approve of?

299
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:04,877
-A man Isabel thinks is cute.
-I'm completely against it.

300
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,113
I'm going to be an actress
in a television series.

301
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,882
She's going to play Samantha
on Bewitched.

302
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:14,053
Bewitched? That's an insult
to our way of life.

303
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,189
(LAUGHING) Your Dad is a hoot!

304
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:20,092
I'm just going to go ahead and
take one of these, because
you've got a lot here.

305
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,329
-Oh sure.
-Anyway, if anyone's robbing
my house, let me know,

306
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,932
and I'll do the same for you.
(HUMS THEME)

307
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,134
Oh! And if you get a date that
has a friend,

308
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,739
make sure he's not secretly
married before you call me.
Bye, Nigel!

309
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,007
-Bye, Maria.
-Bye, Maria.

310
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,310
Why can't you be happy for me?

311
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:42,414
In less than a week I have
become a rich and
famous actress

312
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,552
living in a house
I don't even have
to pay rent for

313
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,654
just like every other person
in the world.

314
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,423
Why wouldn't I be happy?
You've turned your back
on your own kind,

315
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,894
and now you live
down the street
from a Denny's.

316
00:24:54,961 --> 00:25:00,833
-Don't make fun of my life.
I could make fun of your life.
-So, what about this man?

317
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,003
No, I am not telling you
anything anymore,
you're too negative.

318
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,039
One morning,
I shot a lion in my pajamas.

319
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:10,743
Now, what he was doing
in my pajamas,
I'll never know.

320
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,115
Uncle Arthur. Classic.

321
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,318
Your brand of low comedy
always did appeal
to adolescent mentality.

322
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,660
-I won't do it.
-Speaking of traveling,
Darrin, remember that time...

323
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:31,097
-Maybe I will.
-Maybe I will.

324
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:36,669
...sent over from Europe. It's
simply gorgeous. It reminds me
of the one in California.

325
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:43,242
(SNEEZES)
-Lucinda, you really should be
watching this.

326
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:54,854
I'm only trying to say that
you broke your promise. You
gave me your word, no more...

327
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:59,258
Stuff.
It's a little harder to break
the habit than I thought.

328
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:05,431
-Well you can do it. I've got
a lot of faith in you.
-Aw, thank you, darling.

329
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:11,671
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the star of the new
Bewitched, Jack Wyatt!

330
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:21,848
Hey, I didn't expect you guys
to be here!
(LAUGHTER)

331
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:26,886
Okay, as you know, we're here
for Bewitched. But of course
it's not the same Bewitched

332
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:29,221
that you remember.
It's being retooled.

333
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:32,024
-But there is going to be a
Samantha, isn't there?
-Of course.

334
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:37,029
-Isabel, can you come
out here?
(APPLAUSE)

335
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,867
Be brave.
You look beautiful.

336
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:45,104
Ladies and gentlemen of the
press, I'd like you to meet
the talented and delightful

337
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:49,375
Ms. Isabel Bigelow.
Say hello to the people,
Isabel.

338
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:54,146
-Hello!
-No, no, into the microphone.
Here. Here.

339
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:58,985
-Hello!
-That's enough.
Now do that thing that you do.

340
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:06,993
(APPLAUSE)
-Great! Just stand there.

341
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,964
And guess who's playing
Endora.

342
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:17,569
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the great,
the legendary

343
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:22,809
Miss Iris Smythson,
as my mother-in-law.
(APPLAUSE)

344
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,344
Iris Smythson. Iris?
Iris?

345
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:39,025
Ok, yeah.

346
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:46,766
Iris Smythson.
And of course she hates me.
Don't you?

347
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:52,071
-Anything you say, Jerry.
-Jack. See what I mean?
That's a joke, right?

348
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:57,076
-Endora used to refer to
Darrin as Derwood.
-No, I just forgot your name.

349
00:27:57,143 --> 00:28:02,381
But the news here isn't Iris
Smythson, or Jack Wyatt,
who's trying the small screen

350
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:08,054
after the twin disasters of
his last movie, and a messy
split from his wife, Sheila

351
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,559
who's already found someone
new after a marriage that
lasted only 19 months.

352
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:18,831
-Didn't she leave him for a
snowboarder/underwear model?
-He's a moron/idiot.

353
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,100
-That's right.
-Aren't they living together?

354
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:25,104
Yes, in my house!
My house that I bought
before I even met her.

355
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,673
But she won't move
or sign the divorce papers.

356
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,778
The big news is
the surprise casting
of an unknown as Samantha.

357
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:38,484
Her name is Isabel Bigelow
and she's quite the charmer,
isn't she? That's magic.

358
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,186
So, what's Jack Wyatt
thinking?

359
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:43,555
"My career has tanked, so I'll
fix it by playing Darrin"?

360
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:48,027
-Yeah. Because that's crazy.
Who's running his life?
-Plus, he did not look well.

361
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:52,531
Not look well? I look fine.
I'm extremely healthy.

362
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:59,138
Oh, Richie. Richie.
What am I going to
do with you?

363
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:03,109
(RINGING)
-This is Richie.

364
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:06,478
Richie. Why'd you talk me
into doing this show? Huh?

365
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:09,015
What was I thinking?
What were you thinking?

366
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,118
We were both thinking
the same thing, Jackattack.
Cast a nobody.

367
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,286
You're completely safe.

368
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:17,156
Richie, can't you come over
here? I really could use a
little support on this one.

369
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:21,227
Jack, I can't because I'm
about to step into a meeting
with the head of NBC.

370
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,962
(SHOUTING)
I'll be right there!
One second!

371
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:26,933
Look, I don't know
if you know this,
but I'm Darrin, okay?

372
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:31,838
They replaced Darrin on
the original Bewitched
and no one noticed!

373
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,473
Nobody is going to
replace you.

374
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,877
I'm Darrin!
How did this happen?

375
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:15,647
Hold the work!

376
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:19,351
Once upon a time,
there was a typical
red-blooded American boy

377
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:23,355
who happened to bump into
a typical American girl.

378
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:25,424
(LAUGHTER)

379
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,026
And cut!

380
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:32,631
-Jack, Jack.
-How was I? How was I?

381
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:35,567
-That was so good!
-Don't lie to me.

382
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,537
My ribs hurt.

383
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:41,640
-Jack? Uno mas? From the top?
-One more?

384
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:46,412
-Did you see what happened?
Good stuff.

385
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:50,082
Moving on!

386
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:56,488
-You know it, dude. Nice one.
JACK: Here we go. Off to a
good start, huh?

387
00:30:56,555 --> 00:31:01,260
And after a while, he did
what any red-blooded
American boy would do.

388
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:05,264
-Samantha, will you marry me?
-Cut!

389
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:08,434
Great! Beautiful.
That was good.

390
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,837
-Action.
-You're a witch?

391
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:15,241
And you waited
until our wedding night
to tell me?

392
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:18,044
I don't believe this!
Oh, golly!

393
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,612
(LAUGHTER)

394
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:26,152
Samantha.

395
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,864
-Cut! Cut!
-Joey, for God's sake.

396
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:42,568
Are you trying to kill
everyone?
Because we can't breathe.

397
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,572
Iris, you can't nod to the
audience in the middle of
the show.

398
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,907
-It just breaks the reality.
-What?

399
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:51,377
-You can't nod to them.
You can't do a little...
-Go sit!

400
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,313
-In your chair.
Back to your chair.
-All right, but...

401
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,717
-Take two up. Rolling!
-You're a witch?

402
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:04,856
And you waited until
our wedding night to tell me?
I can't believe this.

403
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,462
What's going on?

404
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:15,634
Samantha.

405
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,242
Why is she waving?

406
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:29,381
-Who are you?
-I am Samantha's mother,
Endora.

407
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,884
A mortal?
You married a mortal?
Oh, my poor, poor baby.

408
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,955
-This is just horrifying.
-I think I need a drink.

409
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:39,158
Freeze!

410
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,629
Unfreeze!

411
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,331
Aaah!

412
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,802
What a shame
you didn't drink it.
If you had,

413
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:56,408
perhaps you could've spent
your wedding night
as a bullfrog.

414
00:32:58,044 --> 00:33:02,381
Don't worry, Samantha.
I won't do it.
Witch's honor.

415
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:13,559
My darling,
we are quicksilver.
We're a fleeting shadow.

416
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,328
-We're a distant sound.
-That's your mother?

417
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:20,066
We live on the wind,
in the sparkle of a star.

418
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:25,104
And you want to trade all that
for an acre of crabgrass?

419
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:29,308
-Did she just call me
an acre of crabgrass?
-Deal with it, Derwood.

420
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:36,182
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!

421
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:44,356
I want a piece of the show.
Why? Because I put this thing
together, that's why.

422
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:47,959
Because Jack Wyatt
doesn't parallel park
without checking with me.

423
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:52,264
Let me call you back. J-Bone!
You're crushing it, baby.
Absolutely crushing it.

424
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,266
-I think we got something.
-It's exciting.

425
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:57,369
-How's Isabel doing?
-She's perfect. She looks hot

426
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:59,471
and she lets you score
like a madman.

427
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,841
-I know. She's great.
-I can't believe you
found her, baby.

428
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,510
You think she's going to
notice?

429
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:07,146
What? That she doesn't
have a part?
Not a chance. She's clueless.

430
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:12,651
Plus, I think she's got
a little thing for you.
It's freaking pathetic.

431
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,920
-You think so?
-Yes.

432
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:19,158
-Man, that would be...
-Such a nightmare. I know.
Can you imagine?

433
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:23,662
Although, she does have
kind of a cute little
back end on her.

434
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,132
I mean, I wouldn't kick her
out of bed for eating
a box of crackers.

435
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,966
Isabel?

436
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:32,504
-Did she hear us?
-Not a chance.

437
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,240
A couple of changes
to the script.

438
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:38,277
It was running a little long,
so we cut your lines.

439
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,013
Think of it this way,
it's less to memorize.

440
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,516
(NERVOUS LAUGH)
Sorry.

441
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:48,987
Lunch!

442
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,836
Isabel!

443
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:09,375
I feel like a fool. A big,
stupid, sad fool, and yet I'm
angry as well.

444
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:13,445
-What's going on?
-Let's set fire to his
trailer. Let's just do it.

445
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:17,249
Isabel, this is awesome!
You're on TV.

446
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:21,520
He lied to me.
He tricked me.
He said he needed me.

447
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:24,356
When all he needed was someone
to stand next to him

448
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:28,093
while he says
his stupid clever lines.

449
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,998
-Hi, I'm Maria.
-Nina.

450
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:40,639
He seemed so messy and
sincere. But really,
he's just a big fake.

451
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:44,109
We could electrocute him.
There's tons of wires
around here.

452
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:48,880
I want to cry.
I want to break things.
I want to hurt him.

453
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:52,751
Yet there's a part of me that
still has a small amount
of feeling for him.

454
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,087
-How can this be?
-When my first husband left
me, I wanted to

455
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,291
cut the brake cables in his
car, but instead we ended up

456
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,693
having sex on
the elliptical machine.

457
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,432
He doesn't understand who
he's dealing with.
He has no idea.

458
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:10,068
Look, you have three options.
You put up with it,

459
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:13,672
quit, or get mad.

460
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,776
What would Samantha do?

461
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,658
She chose mad, right?

462
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:49,140
Aaah!

463
00:36:56,348 --> 00:37:01,587
Okay, everybody, settle down.
Okay, working very quietly,
like little mice.

464
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:05,857
I don't want to see or hear
what you're doing.

465
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:10,796
Okay, so, Isabel, just to
refresh your memory,
Darrin's ex-girlfriend...

466
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:15,033
-I read the script.
-Okay. Well, let's just go
over it one more time.

467
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,104
-Oh, and we rehearsed it
a lot.
-Well, I'm aware of that.

468
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,275
Darrin's ex-girlfriend has
invited you both
over for dinner.

469
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,877
And Darrin forced you
to come with him...

470
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:28,880
He tricked me. Because he is
a self-centered has-been.

471
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,750
No, no, baby,
that's not it. No.

472
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:35,887
Because he wants his dog back,
and then Darrin says his line:

473
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:38,857
(TOGETHER)
"It's my dog.
I want him back."

474
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:42,794
(LAUGHTER)
It always kills me, Jack.
You ready to go?

475
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,397
-Let's do it. Let's do it.
-All right then. Saddle up.
Rolling!

476
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,671
Action!

477
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:56,207
(DRAMATICALLY) It's my dog.
My dog!

478
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,677
And I will die if I do
not have him back.

479
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:02,748
Do you understand?
I will die

480
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:07,419
if I do not have him back!

481
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,088
Cut!

482
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:14,693
Well, that was a bit much,
Jack. You want to take it down
a notch?

483
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,895
Or five?

484
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,365
You know what? Just keep it
going. Let me just go right
away. I'll get it this time

485
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:20,432
Rolling!

486
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,034
Action!

487
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:28,640
Where art thou, dog?
Thy canine lover.

488
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,208
What's happening?

489
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:34,346
Where is your hot breath
upon the nape of my neck?

490
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:37,983
We shall form a bond of
brotherhood, man and beast.

491
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:42,488
-You shall lick my face
and I shall lick your snout.
-Cut! Jack?

492
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:47,459
-Guys, I'm not doing this
on purpose, I swear to you.
-Okay. All right.

493
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:48,760
Rolling.

494
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:53,098
Esta mi perro.

495
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,434
Mi perro es mi corazon.

496
00:38:55,501 --> 00:39:00,606
Muchos taquitos
esbuena suerte.

497
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:08,213
Oh my God! Where's my dog?
Totally. I have a totally
great dog.

498
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:12,818
(SCREAMS INCOMPREHENSIBLY)

499
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,920
Jack. Jack.
What are you doing?

500
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:22,093
This is where the dog has to
decide between Darrin's ex
and Darrin.

501
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:28,366
Samantha wiggles her nose
and the dog chooses Darrin.
Rolling!

502
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:31,803
I know how we can
solve this, Darrin.
We'll let Satchel decide.

503
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,842
That's a great idea.
Come to Daddy, Satchel.
Look! Good boy.

504
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,945
-Come to Mommy. Good boy!
-Satchel...

505
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:43,949
-Okay, Isabel,
wiggle your nose.
-Satchel. Come to Mommy.

506
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:48,253
-Come on. Come on. Up!
Right here!
-Come to Mommy, Satchel.

507
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,723
-Come to Daddy.
-I got it, Jack. I got it.

508
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,725
Don't you dare go to Daddy.
Come to Mommy!

509
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,828
No, no, no. You love Daddy.
Come on, Satchel.

510
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:04,603
-He's coming. He's coming.
-He's just sitting there.

511
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:11,710
(APPLAUSE)
Cut!

512
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:14,613
-Jim, what's going on here?
-Joey!

513
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:19,451
If the dog runs to you again,
try this.

514
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:25,724
-Come to Daddy, Satchel.
-Satchel, come to Mommy.

515
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:29,495
-Come on! Come on, Satchel.
-Come on, boy, please?

516
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,330
Good girl.

517
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,537
Thank God you didn't have
a great dane!

518
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:41,740
(LAUGHTER AND
APPLAUSE)

519
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:43,441
Damn it!

520
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,712
Cut!

521
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,219
Darling, that was marvelous.
But, watch out for that.

522
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,889
Please don't say anything.

523
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,492
Calm down, you're not alone.

524
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,930
I'm not? Are there others?

525
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:10,569
There are many others.
Many actors, they develop

526
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:13,939
tricks, twitches, really.

527
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:18,644
-You don't want to
become mannered.
-Oh, no, I don't.

528
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:21,813
Thank you, Iris.

529
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:42,167
-Hello.
-Daddy, what...?

530
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:46,972
Well, if it isn't my spell-
casting magical daughter who
gave up witchcraft.

531
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,174
You've had quite a day today,
haven't you?

532
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,477
I was provoked. I fell off the
wagon. It was a one-time
thing.

533
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:01,553
So you're not in love
with him anymore?

534
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,089
I have never disliked a man
more in my entire life,

535
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:06,391
which proves that I am
completely over him.

536
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,660
Not necessarily. In fact...

537
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:12,363
Besides, it was just a crush,
which is an intense but
superficial attraction

538
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,434
that can easily be mistaken
for something deeper.
Now go away.

539
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:23,541
-I have a crush on Endora.
-What?

540
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,082
Daddy, where are you?

541
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:36,855
I said, I have a crush
on Endora.

542
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:39,457
-Daddy. No.
-So lovely.

543
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:44,395
-Her name is not Endora.
It's Iris.
-Iris. A spring flower.

544
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:49,635
You can't. Now that I turned
out to be so wrong about him,
my job is all that I've got.

545
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:52,203
-Please don't mess it up.
-How could I do that?

546
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:56,975
How? You'll sleep with her,
cheat on her, she'll go crazy
and she'll take it out on me.

547
00:42:57,042 --> 00:43:00,779
I don't want you to
get involved with Iris.
I mean it.

548
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:05,250
-You can't stop being a witch.
-I can, too. You'll see.

549
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,719
-Cannot.
-Can too.

550
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:11,422
-Just accept it.
-Never.

551
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:14,860
-Tell me about Bewitched.
Some have said it's a crass
attempt by the network

552
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,930
to market nostalgia rather
than take a risk on new ideas.

553
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:23,769
This isn't the old Bewitched.
It's been refocused.
Let's just say the only thing

554
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:26,437
I won't be doing is this...

555
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:36,181
So you leave the nose-wiggling
to the witch.
But you do it so well.

556
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:38,784
Well, I don't know about that.
I did coach her, though.

557
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:43,521
-Can we get a close-up
on the nose?
-I'd rather not.

558
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:46,792
Which camera?
Here? Okay.

559
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:50,328
(PHONE RINGS)

560
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:52,764
Shall we discuss,
dare we discuss,

561
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:55,100
-Hello?
-Last Year in Katmandu?

562
00:43:55,166 --> 00:44:00,538
Hi, Nina.
Yes, yes I'm watching him.

563
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:02,974
What's a dick?

564
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:05,576
...no one ever sets out
to make a bad movie...

565
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:10,682
Oh. What does that have to do
with how obnoxious
he is being?

566
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:12,684
...Some movies are
career-enders...

567
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:15,353
Right. Right, we need a plan.

568
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,224
-What went wrong?
-You know, I hate to
point fingers,

569
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,661
but I'm going to blame
the wardrobe department.
-The wardrobe department?

570
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,063
I think it got in the way.

571
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,466
-Maybe I should quit.
-Honey, you can't quit.

572
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:32,904
-Why not?
Isn't that what people do?
-He has to quit, not you.

573
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:34,906
-Yeah, right, like that's ever
going to happen.

574
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:39,110
We have to make him quit. If
we get naked pictures of him
and pictures of farm animals

575
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:42,147
I could just Photoshop them.
-That's an excellent idea.

576
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,582
No, no, no. Wait.
Calm down. Calm down.

577
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:49,220
No, no, no, this is not
what I wanted.
I wanted something normal.

578
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:52,223
What should I do?

579
00:44:59,765 --> 00:45:01,032
(THUMP)

580
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,104
(THUMP)

581
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:17,715
Oh, my.
Ooh, what a mess.

582
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:21,419
Your Aunt Clara used to be
able to make
a clean landing.

583
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:25,991
Aunt Clara?

584
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:31,396
Oh, Aunt Clara. Oh, thank
goodness you're here.

585
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:36,067
I am in the middle of a total,
total crisis at work.
I'm quitting.

586
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:40,571
No, you mustn't quit.
The show must go on.
-Isabel, are you all right?

587
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:46,544
-My friends. I have friends.
They don't know we're witches.
-Mum's the word.

588
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:49,747
You know, there was
an Aunt Clara on
the original Bewitched.

589
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:53,551
-What a coincidence!
-She was a witch.

590
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:57,555
So am I.

591
00:45:57,622 --> 00:46:01,326
She was always screwing up.

592
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:05,296
-Really?
-I have made up my mind.
I'm quitting tomorrow,

593
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:10,101
and I'll do something else,
like sailing or
polishing fruit.

594
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:13,171
It's too bad you're not a
witch. You could put a hex
on Jack.

595
00:46:13,238 --> 00:46:16,774
Oh, I can. I certainly can.
Who is Jack?

596
00:46:16,842 --> 00:46:19,477
The reason I'm quitting.

597
00:46:19,544 --> 00:46:24,315
-Well, why not put a hex
on him.
-Because I'm giving it up.

598
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:26,151
-Just a little one.
-Aunt Clara.

599
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:30,088
Just to get him to behave.
I'll do it.

600
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:35,760
And then I can keep my job.
Which would help
my self-esteem.

601
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:40,165
You know, there's only one
problem with a hex. There's no
such thing as magic.

602
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:44,769
So, what's your idea,
Little Miss Doubtful?

603
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:46,872
-Well, I have a Taser.
-Nina.

604
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:51,977
No, I think we should Taser
him and throw him into the
shark tank at SeaWorld.

605
00:46:52,043 --> 00:47:02,520
-No. You think we should
do a hex.
-I think we should do a hex.

606
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:08,459
* ...witchy woman,
see how high
she flies... *

607
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:13,098
A pinch of jasmine, wolfbane,

608
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,834
-Grapefruit pith.
-Grapefruit pith.

609
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:21,973
I feel so alive. I feel like
one of those people
I'd make fun of.

610
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,043
I feel like I believe
in unicorns.

611
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,846
-Did I put in the wolfbane?
I can't remember.
-Aunt Clara.

612
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:33,351
Thank you, darling. Thank you.
Oh well...

613
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,375
Isabel.

614
00:47:57,442 --> 00:48:04,082
* Isabel, bo-bel,
Banana-fana fo-fel
Fee-fy-fo-fel, Isabel! *

615
00:48:04,149 --> 00:48:06,617
"The Name Game!"

616
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:09,120
-Oh boy.
-Good morning.

617
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:13,391
Randall, take that stupid sign
off that machine. Free
cappuccinos for everyone.

618
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:16,161
Buongiorno, buongiorno.

619
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,729
-How are we all doing?
Has anyone seen Isabel?
-No, why?

620
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:21,099
-Because I miss her.
-Listen, Jack.

621
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:25,770
-Yes.
-We got the test scores
from the pilot

622
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:29,374
How did Isabel do? 99%
percent in the top box!
Why didn't you tell me?

623
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,711
This is great news.
Of course she got a 99%.
Because she's dynamite.

624
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:38,049
Absolute dynamite.
High-fives all the way around.

625
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:40,751
-But, Jack, there is a
problem. Your scores...

626
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:47,192
32%. That's better than zero,
huh? You know what? That's
just constructive criticism.

627
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:52,530
The dog scored higher than me.
He's a cute dog.
What do the comment cards say?

628
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:57,435
-Oh, they don't really...
-"Jack Wyatt is a real tool."

629
00:48:57,502 --> 00:49:00,171
But a good tool.
Like a Jacksaw!

630
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:04,109
You know what? Who cares?
This just means we've got hard
work to do, okay?

631
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:07,112
Hey, I never said
I was perfect.
The important thing is Isabel.

632
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:08,813
-Isabel.
-Yeah, no question.

633
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:14,085
-Good morning, everyone.
-There she is!

634
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:18,223
Is it just my imagination, or
is the room actually brighter
with her here?

635
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:21,592
Look at this bundle
of miraculous talent.

636
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:26,764
Forget 99,
I give her a hundred!

637
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:29,734
Rehearsing!

638
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,870
"Interior, apartment, day.
Samantha and Darrin
are sitting

639
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:36,307
"in their overcrowded
apartment."

640
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:40,211
Darrin, I think we should
buy a house, and I found
one that I love.

641
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:45,716
You nailed that!
I'm about to have a heart
attack. Isn't she great?

642
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:48,753
And now I kiss her, because
she's in love with
our new house.

643
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,156
Oh, you can't kiss me.
I'm not in this scene.

644
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:52,690
-You're not in the scene?
-No.

645
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:56,394
No, no, no. She isn't in the
scene? This isn't happening!

646
00:49:56,461 --> 00:50:00,598
What? She has to be
in every scene! Okay?

647
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:05,036
Rewrite! Go! Rewrite.

648
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:09,974
-Everyone, Isabel needs
a joke.
-I would love a joke.

649
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:13,811
One joke, coming up.
Oh, and then I kiss her
because she's so funny.

650
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:17,248
And a job. She needs a job.

651
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:20,618
Yes! Make her the CEO of a
multinational corporation.

652
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,221
-Good idea, Jack.
-No. Great idea.

653
00:50:23,288 --> 00:50:26,191
And then I kiss her
because she's so powerful.

654
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:33,198
It's too much. What happened?

655
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:38,536
Aunt Clara. Aunt Clara? Please
pick up the phone, something
terrible is happening.

656
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:41,572
Mm hmm, something terrible
is happening.

657
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:44,509
I know, I know.
It wasn't supposed to, and...

658
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:46,544
You should never, ever
get involved with an actor.

659
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:49,214
I'm not involved with him,
I don't think.

660
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,717
-Witch's honor?
-What?

661
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,553
I'm just being Endora.

662
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:00,057
Isabel, actors look normal,
sometimes better than normal,

663
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:03,494
But deep down,
there is no deep down.

664
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:07,064
Now, I thought you were safe.
He loathed you.
What on Earth happened?

665
00:51:07,132 --> 00:51:09,400
A little witchcraft,
I suspect.

666
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:12,937
Even though we weren't going
to do it, were we, darling?

667
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,505
I'm Nigel Bigelow. I'm...

668
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,242
-Isabel's father.
How do you do?
-Oh, daddy...

669
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,277
We talked about this,
remember?

670
00:51:19,344 --> 00:51:21,846
-I'm...
-I know who you are.

671
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,948
I've seen everything
you've ever done.

672
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,883
Lysistrata in Florence,

673
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:29,053
Blithe Spirit in New York.
You're Endora.

674
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,488
It's a marvel.

675
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:33,191
-It comes so easily, really.
-Really?
-Oh, yes...

676
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:35,059
Because I am a witch.

677
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:38,163
-Really?
-Oh, yes. I put out
all the lights

678
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:40,565
in Leicester Square,
just by walking past.

679
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:42,533
-Tell me more.
Tell me everything!
-(LAUGHING)

680
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,235
Oh please, come in!

681
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:45,670
-(GIGGLING)
-NIGEL: Ciao.

682
00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:50,107
This is just fine...

683
00:51:50,175 --> 00:51:51,376
MAN: Isabel!

684
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,977
Hey!

685
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,078
Isabel!

686
00:51:54,145 --> 00:51:55,246
Isabel.

687
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:57,114
Hey... Hi!

688
00:51:57,182 --> 00:52:00,017
Listen. Maybe we could
go to dinner tonight.
God, I'm so nervous.

689
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:02,820
-I don't think so.
I have to get home.
-We won't make it a date.

690
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:05,756
I'll just happen to stop by
your place and ask you
if you're hungry.

691
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:07,358
-No.
-Yes! That's a yes.

692
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:09,894
-No!
-I'll be by at great.
I mean...

693
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,396
I'll be by at eight!

694
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,431
Stop by if you need anything.
I'm right here.

695
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:14,699
Okay...
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

696
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:20,738
Aunt Clara!

697
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:21,839
Undo it!

698
00:52:21,906 --> 00:52:23,674
Undo it! You overdid it.
Undo it!

699
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,176
Oh dear...

700
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:27,978
-Aunt Clara!
-I'm not too sure
how to undo it!

701
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:30,681
Undoing it's not the same
as doing it.

702
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:32,883
He wants to have dinner.

703
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:36,053
-This isn't what I wanted.
-Lorna Doone?

704
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,522
No! No...

705
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:41,659
Darling, I'm sure you can undo
the hex if you really want to.

706
00:52:41,726 --> 00:52:43,894
-Huh?
-I'm expected in Japan.

707
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:48,699
Well, that certainly didn't
work, did it?

708
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,272
Aunt Clara?

709
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:57,408
Aunt Clara, come back here
right now.

710
00:52:57,475 --> 00:53:00,345
He's gonna be here any minute.
Aunt Clara!

711
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:03,047
But that doesn't matter
because I'm not going
out with him.

712
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,115
No, no I'm not.
I'm not!

713
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:12,923
Who cares what I look like?

714
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,492
I'm just gonna undo the hex.

715
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,827
I'm not even gonna bother
dressing up.

716
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,568
(DOORBELL RINGS)

717
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:35,880
I'm just gonna open the door,
undo it and slam the door
in his face.

718
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:39,016
Hey, I just happened to be
in the neighborhood with
these roses

719
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:42,620
and a Cat Steven's CD
and this bracelet

720
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:44,489
and I thought I'd stop by.

721
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,957
-You're sweating.
-Like a pig.

722
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,427
How divine.

723
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:54,164
Oh! (GIGGLES)

724
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,666
You look stunning.

725
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:58,202
No! Ravishing.

726
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:00,037
You look...stunnishing!

727
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:05,009
Is this your purse?

728
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,281
You're not too cold, are you?

729
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:11,616
-No.
-Not too warm?

730
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:13,718
-Mmm-Mmm.
-Okay...

731
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:16,053
-Are we going somewhere?
-Dinner.

732
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:23,260
I wanna know everything.

733
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:25,396
You talk, okay?

734
00:54:25,463 --> 00:54:27,197
I'm just gonna listen.

735
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,701
Shed your radiance
and I'll just soak it up
like a plant.

736
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:34,004
Start in kindergarten.

737
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:35,540
I didn't go to kindergarten.

738
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,142
-I was home schooled.
-You were home schooled?

739
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,110
So was I.

740
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:42,680
How amazing! That's freaky.

741
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:46,116
-I'm getting chills.
-Yeah, that is kind of
amazing.

742
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:47,552
My parents were hippies,
were yours?

743
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:50,488
-No.
-That's so weird.

744
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:53,791
My parents were hippies
and yours weren't.
What are the odds?

745
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:55,660
Though we did have incense
and candles.

746
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:57,294
-So did we!
-You did?

747
00:54:57,362 --> 00:54:59,163
To this day, the smell
of incense makes me puke.

748
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,632
-Yes! Me too.
-Amazing!

749
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:03,668
-Wow.
-I brought duck.

750
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:05,169
Oh! I...

751
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,004
-I love duck.
-So do I!

752
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:08,606
How amazing is that?

753
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:10,375
Well, most people love duck.

754
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:12,042
You know what?
No, they don't.

755
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:13,177
Wait!

756
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:14,945
-I wrote you a song.
-Oh...

757
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:17,314
-No one's ever written me
a song.
-Well...

758
00:55:17,382 --> 00:55:18,416
I did.

759
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,252
* Hey...

760
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,155
* pretty lady

761
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:28,459
* I'm back here with my heart

762
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:31,161
* Hey...

763
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:33,063
* pretty lady

764
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:37,468
* Are you a dream, made real?

765
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:41,639
* My soul, you have healed

766
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:45,142
* Make me a better man

767
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:49,447
* I wanna set up residence

768
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:53,418
* In your promised land

769
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:55,052
Okay, and this is the...

770
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,487
power-ballad guitar-solo.

771
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:58,489
(VOCALIZING)

772
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:03,761
* Promise land!

773
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:04,862
Now, you sing the chorus.

774
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:08,365
* -Promised land
-Yeah. *

775
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:12,169
Drum solo.
(VOCALIZING)

776
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,906
* -Promised land
-Promised land
-Leg kick. *

777
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:17,207
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

778
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:18,976
Okay, I'm gonna
break the guitar.

779
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,278
* Promised land!
Whoo!

780
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:27,351
JACK: * Promised land

781
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,254
Whoo!

782
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:39,363
We're about to kiss,
aren't we?

783
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:42,600
I thought so, but thanks for
ruining the moment,
Miss Narrator.

784
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,738
Oh, my ruby jewel.

785
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:53,343
-What?
-My chocolate-covered
strawberry.

786
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,546
I wanna bask in
our love like...

787
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:57,281
like a house-cat,

788
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,983
lying in the sun.

789
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:01,486
-Meow. Meow.
-Jack, Jack... Stop.

790
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:02,853
I forgot I...

791
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,490
Why did I let myself forget?
It was...

792
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:08,025
It was so nice,
I couldn't help myself and...

793
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:09,927
Oh, Jack!

794
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:12,697
This is sad.
This is... No.

795
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,431
Let's make love
in a hot-air balloon.

796
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:17,401
-Uh...
-Let's make love
in a candy factory.

797
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:19,737
-Huh?
-Let's make love
in a petting zoo.

798
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:21,606
-I have to undo this. I do.
-Let's make love

799
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:24,108
at Sea World
on the back of a killer whale.

800
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,911
Because it doesn't mean
anything unless it's real.

801
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:43,260
What witches wish, no mortal
needs. Let time repent
and unsow its seeds

802
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:46,531
And now I speak the ancient
word of redemption

803
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:48,265
and regret.

804
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:50,134
Rewind.

805
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:27,004
MAN: So you leave the
nose-wiggling to the witch.

806
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:29,039
But you do it so well!

807
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:31,508
-JACK: I did coach her though.
-MAN: Can we get a close-up

808
00:58:31,576 --> 00:58:32,710
on the nose?

809
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:34,044
JACK: I'd rather not.

810
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:35,913
Which camera?

811
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,648
(PHONE RINGS)

812
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:40,117
Hello, Nina.

813
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:42,352
I just knew it was you.
That's all.

814
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:43,621
Yes he is.

815
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:46,791
He is a giant, male
reproductive organ.

816
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,694
We don't need a plan.
I already know what
I'm gonna do.

817
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,528
I'm gonna speak to him...

818
00:58:51,596 --> 00:58:54,231
about his behavior.
I'm gonna talk to him
sensibly

819
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:57,201
and directly
and I know he will change.

820
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,936
You'll see.
Bye.

821
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,142
Butt out, Samantha.
I know what I'm doing.

822
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,547
I mean it.

823
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:14,619
JACK: * Jack-Jack-bo-back

824
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:16,386
* Banana-fana-fo-fack

825
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:18,422
* Bee-bi-bo-back

826
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:19,924
* Jack!

827
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:22,860
Guys, make me 20 cappuccinos.

828
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:24,561
Bring me the best one.

829
00:59:24,629 --> 00:59:26,731
-Hey J-Bone.
-Hey, Buddy.

830
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,498
-The test-scores are in.
-How'd I do?

831
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,500
-90? 100? 120?
-Well...

832
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,037
-No...
-140? What does it say?

833
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:34,438
I got it.
I got it right here.

834
00:59:35,472 --> 00:59:36,807
32.

835
00:59:36,874 --> 00:59:38,142
I got a 32?

836
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:40,745
Is that for real?

837
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:41,979
The dogs scored
higher than I did.

838
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:44,581
Well, it's not you, Jack.

839
00:59:44,649 --> 00:59:45,683
It's Darrin.

840
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,451
"That Jack Wyatt
is a real tool.

841
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,186
"We hate him.

842
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,055
"We mean the actor,
not the character."

843
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:54,759
Get a grip.

844
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:58,162
Hug me.

845
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,704
I'm gonna be doing
dinner theater at Boca Raton.

846
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:09,039
They hate the show.
The whole show.

847
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,308
They hate everyone on it.

848
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,743
-Yeah, they did...
-Yep.

849
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,979
Isabel must have
gotten savaged.

850
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,848
She got 99?

851
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:19,549
99? Is that for real?

852
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,085
Is that a joke?

853
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:23,453
She didn't say anything!

854
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,823
How is it that someone
who doesn't say anything

855
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:28,592
scores higher than someone
who had all the lines?

856
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:29,760
Oh my...

857
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:32,129
Did anyone anticipate
this as a possibility?

858
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:33,397
Hindsight's 20/20.

859
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:35,432
Good morning, everyone.

860
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:36,767
And they think I'm a tool?

861
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:39,336
I haven't been called a tool
since I was 15.

862
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:40,871
Thank you, guys.

863
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:42,339
Thank you!

864
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:45,442
You know what? No one
ever liked Darrin!

865
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:48,445
No one! Why did we ever
think that was gonna change?

866
01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:49,579
I have something to say.

867
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,782
This is unbelievable.

868
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:53,684
A 32?

869
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:54,785
That's for real.

870
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:56,286
A 3 in front of a 2.

871
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:57,587
-Oh, my God!
-Wait!

872
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:58,989
I have something to say!

873
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:01,458
And she got 99?

874
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:02,592
Were they high?

875
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,729
Were the people
in the test group high?

876
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,732
Did we drug test them?

877
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:10,935
Were they just sitting
in the studio, smoking crack?

878
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:14,038
Saying "let's give her a 99
and him a 32?

879
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:16,406
"By the way,
I'm high on crack!"

880
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:18,709
I have something to say!

881
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:20,177
What?

882
01:01:20,244 --> 01:01:22,112
You're a jerk.

883
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,513
What did you just say?

884
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:27,785
I said...

885
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:29,653
You're a jerk!

886
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,122
Everything is about you.

887
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,924
You are selfish

888
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:35,926
and you are self-centered.

889
01:01:35,993 --> 01:01:37,361
And you...you lied to me.

890
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,496
You said you needed me.
You don't need anyone!

891
01:01:39,563 --> 01:01:42,366
Listen, sweetie, why don't you
go to your trailer
and take a Midol?

892
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:45,669
Hey! You be quiet or
I'll give you a tail!

893
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:48,072
-Just calm down.
-You sit down!

894
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:50,540
Sit down.

895
01:01:50,607 --> 01:01:51,608
Wow...

896
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:56,380
This show is supposed
to be about a marriage.

897
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,917
A real marriage
with real problems, like...

898
01:01:59,984 --> 01:02:02,152
like what color to paint
the kitchen or...

899
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,621
or I don't know,
other problems. I can't even
think of them right now

900
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:07,191
but the only problems
you care about are your own!

901
01:02:07,257 --> 01:02:10,427
No wonder the audience
doesn't like this show.

902
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:13,297
A witch marries a mortal.

903
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:16,000
Who in their right mind
would want to marry you?

904
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,367
-Hey...
-That's it...

905
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:18,936
You're fired.

906
01:02:19,003 --> 01:02:20,337
Doesn't matter. I...

907
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:21,671
I quit!

908
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,974
Yeah.

909
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:25,042
So...

910
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:27,711
You better call my agent.

911
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:29,213
You don't have an agent.

912
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:31,181
Then call my cable man.

913
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,027
(WHISTLES) Sorry...

914
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,661
So, uh...

915
01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:45,996
You all right?

916
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:48,165
No one's talked to me like
that in 20 years.

917
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:50,600
Once a week, a woman
talks to me like that.

918
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:52,569
She just stripped
me bare and...

919
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:53,838
stuck the knife in.

920
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,973
Let's go to the peninsula
and get some oysters.

921
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,174
You know what I think?

922
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:58,708
Hey.

923
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,577
The woman needs a part.

924
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:02,012
I'm sorry?

925
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,514
I mean, if you got Sammy Sosa,
you don't bench him.

926
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:06,716
If you got Gorbachev
in the ballet,

927
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,085
you let him dance
the big number.

928
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:09,887
I don't think Gorbachev
was a dancer.

929
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:12,156
Yes he was, Ritchie.
He absolutely was.

930
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:13,423
Look it up.

931
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,230
Isabel!

932
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,531
Hey!

933
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:23,167
Hey, Isabel!

934
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:25,035
Wait! Wait, don't go!

935
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:26,503
Isabel.

936
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,305
Please don't go.
Please don't go. That...

937
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:30,240
That was incredible.

938
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:32,776
-What?
-Just now! That.

939
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:34,311
-Hey!
-You yelled at me.

940
01:03:34,378 --> 01:03:35,445
You were upfront

941
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:36,580
and honest

942
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,082
and you called me out

943
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,349
on all my crap.

944
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,717
It was just great!

945
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:42,819
-Ah!
-Oh, God.

946
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:45,122
I've never done
anything like this.

947
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:47,591
It was very hard,
but secretly quite thrilling.

948
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:49,960
Even my ex-wife...

949
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:51,195
She never yelled.

950
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,496
She just locked me out.

951
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,064
Oh! In my family,

952
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:55,732
we usually just disappear.

953
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:57,968
No, no. Don't disappear,
Isabel.

954
01:03:58,035 --> 01:03:59,169
One more show.

955
01:04:00,905 --> 01:04:03,273
-I don't think so.
-No, one more taping.

956
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,475
-Please?
-No.
-It's just that...

957
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:06,911
I'm feeling that...

958
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:08,778
I'm feeling like maybe...

959
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,314
I'm sorry.

960
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,581
What'd you say?

961
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:14,384
I'm sorry

962
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:15,552
for how I've been.

963
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:17,854
You're sweating again, I...

964
01:04:19,423 --> 01:04:20,857
I just...
Look.

965
01:04:20,925 --> 01:04:23,193
-One more.
-I love it when you sweat.

966
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,862
One more. Just...

967
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,365
One more and the second
I'm being a jerk, you can yell

968
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:30,234
"Hey! He's being a jerk!"

969
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,269
And we'll shut
the whole thing down.
I promise.

970
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:34,338
We'll burn down
the sets and...

971
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:37,407
and sell the costumes and give
the money to little children.

972
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:39,910
I mean, that's one
possible scenario.

973
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:42,379
You want me to say
"he's being a jerk?"

974
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:43,880
You can yell it, I mean...

975
01:04:43,948 --> 01:04:45,449
He's being a jerk!

976
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:48,585
-Yeah...
-He's being a jerk!

977
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:49,653
Yes.

978
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,521
(YELLING)
(GROWLING)

979
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:56,426
I can't just walk back
in there now.

980
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:58,295
Once you show up
on a golf-cart,

981
01:04:58,362 --> 01:05:00,097
believe me, all is forgiven.

982
01:05:00,164 --> 01:05:01,298
I've done it a lot of times.

983
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:02,732
I was fired.

984
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:03,800
Oh no!

985
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,169
-That's right, I quit.
-Yeah!

986
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,636
-Yeah.
-Hey, let me carry your plant.

987
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:18,515
Honey, your mother's here.

988
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:19,984
Are you two getting along?

989
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,718
Not exactly.

990
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:24,121
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

991
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,924
-Like this?
-Uh-huh. You're doing great.

992
01:05:27,992 --> 01:05:29,559
Really, really great.
One more time.

993
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:33,130
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

994
01:05:33,197 --> 01:05:36,800
* If you like making love
at midnight

995
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:40,237
* In the dunes
on the cape

996
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:43,640
* Then I'm the love
that you've looked for

997
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:46,176
* Write to me and escape

998
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:49,579
So it says here that marriage
can lead to a loss of passion.

999
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:51,215
It's true.

1000
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,850
I feel empty and bored
already.

Mother...

1005
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:06,263
I see you two are actually
getting along.

1006
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:09,233
Endora, you rancid fruit-bag,
get outta my room.

1007
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,302
And my daughter is happy?

1008
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:16,140
That is the cruelest
twist of all.

I am happy, Darrin.

01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,214
Real, honest, no-spells
happy.

You were great today.

1019

Just absolutely amazing.

1020

I don't think I've ever had
so much fun.

Acting is fun.

That is a profoundly
true thing.

a water chestnut?

1026
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:07,691
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know,

Okay?

01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:22,139
This almost won me
a Golden Globe.

Almost.

-Is that it?
-That's good.

Oh, that's even better.

things are worse than
they seem"...

1036
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:35,919
thing. Also known as the
"yikes take".

(GRUNTS)

1038
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:39,689
Yikes.

1039
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,858
Wow.

1040
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,594
Yikes!

1041
01:07:44,661 --> 01:07:47,364
-That was terrible.
-It's okay.
-No, I was terrible.

1042
01:07:47,431 --> 01:07:48,565
I don't think mine
was good either.

1043
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,202
That's it. I'm out of tricks.

1044
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:53,770
What about the funny
walk you do?

1045
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:54,904
-The funny walk?
-Mmm-hmm.

1046
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:56,806
-You don't wanna see
the funny walk.
-I do.

1047
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:58,408
The funny walk is
embarrassing.

1048
01:07:58,475 --> 01:07:59,843
I'd like to see.

1049
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,378
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

1050
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,413
Okay.

1051
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,948
Let's go to our place.

1052
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:18,462
-That it?
-Great.

1053
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:21,931
-It's much harder
than it looks.
-Yeah.

1054
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,122
Five, six, seven, eight.

1055
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:20,690
Whoo!

(MEOWS)

1057
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:03,367
Something magical happened
all by itself.

1058
01:10:07,437 --> 01:10:09,339
Table read in ten minutes!

1059
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,643
-Good morning, everyone!
-Good morning, Jack.

1060
01:10:17,013 --> 01:10:19,549
Jack, I just need to talk
to you about a couple
of these things.

1061
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:22,419
Number one, we're thinking
about moving

1062
01:10:22,486 --> 01:10:25,021
the whole kitchen scene.
Just, it's such...

1063
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:26,623
-It's...
-It's a funny scene.

1064
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,792
It's really funny.
We'd like to get it in

1065
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:29,926
a little earlier.

1066
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:32,296
So probably what we're gonna
do is switch it...

1067
01:10:32,362 --> 01:10:33,597
with the office.

1068
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:38,868
But we're gonna drop that till
a little later in the show.

1069
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:41,338
(GIGGLING)

1070
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:44,774
Dude, are you watching
Jack throw the vibe
to Isabel right now?

1071
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:45,875
(WHISPERING) How are you?

1072
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:46,943
Ooo...

1073
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:50,847
I'm great.

1074
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,987
That's for you.

1075
01:10:58,054 --> 01:10:59,289
Thank you.

1076
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:01,224
Mmm!

1077
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:04,060
That's fantastic.

1078
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:07,297
Stop.

1079
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:11,301
Yeah, I can find something
for him. I can put him in a
little part with maybe no...

1080
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:13,503
no lines or anything
like that.

1081
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:16,105
What is going on
between you and Jack?

1082
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:17,907
Nothing is going on.

1083
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:19,943
We had a date and we kissed

1084
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,979
and now we just wanna spend
all of our time together.

1085
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:26,282
That is the very definition
of something going on.

1086
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:27,684
And you know what?

1087
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:30,920
I didn't use any tricks.
I am trick-free.

1088
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:34,023
Oh my God, it's her.

1089
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:37,427
-Who?
-Jack's wife. I saw a picture
of her in In Style.

1090
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,162
She was the "fashion don't."

1091
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,531
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Jack.

1092
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:44,033
You must be Samantha.

1093
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,902
You look just like
the old one.

1094
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,104

01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,277
Good work.

There he is!

There's my guy!

1100
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:01,050
I've missed him so much.

1101
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:05,121
Let's just say the
"do not disturb" sign will be
on the door-knob tonight.

1102
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,961
-(SCREAM)
-What happened?
-My God!

01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:13,162

(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

1105
01:12:14,798 --> 01:12:16,232
That was a little harsh.

1106
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:24,040
I've missed him so much.

1107
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:28,011
Let's just say the

Hi, baby.

1110
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:34,684
What are you doing here?

1111
01:12:34,751 --> 01:12:36,119
You want my car?

1112
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,721
My grandmother's brooch?

1113
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:38,888
Oh!

1114
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:40,123
You want more money.

1115
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,991
Ding ding ding!
Correct answer.

1116
01:12:43,393 --> 01:12:44,394
No.

1117
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:46,963
I want you back.

1118
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,565
What about Captain Underpants?

1119
01:12:48,632 --> 01:12:50,834
I'm through with him.

1120
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,602
I love you, Jack.

1121
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:54,270
Oh, wait. I get it.

1122
01:12:54,337 --> 01:12:56,272
You heard the show's
getting picked up.

1123
01:12:56,339 --> 01:12:58,141
I heard it's gonna be a hit.

1124
01:12:59,142 --> 01:13:01,044
So what?

1125
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,446
I want you.

1126
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:04,448
I want my husband.

1127
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,152
You know, a week ago,
I would have fallen for that.

1128
01:13:11,755 --> 01:13:13,923
But now there's someone else.

1129
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,091
Someone who's...

1130
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:17,226
incapable of guile.

1131
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:18,394
What's guile?

1132
01:13:19,563 --> 01:13:20,830
Not gonna do it.

1133

No, I'm not.

is going on?

of the house...

Everyone, did you
just see that?

things nailed down,

1170
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,874
I just lose it.

Oh, don't be so hard
on yourself.

1172
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:14,477
It's gonna be okay.

Can I have your attention,
please. I just wanna say
a few words.

deal with this?

What a night.
Is everyone having fun?

EVERYONE: Yeah!

1185
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,535
Great.

I am...

I'm so grateful for so many
things tonight.

trick me into thinking she was
something she wasn't.

From now on,
everyone tells the truth.
Okay?

look good, say I do anyway.

01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,940
-Cheers!
-EVERYONE: Cheers!

1199
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:19,442
-Have a great time!
-Cheers.

1200
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,210
JACK: Don't break
anything, okay?

1201
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:35,591
I hope that touching speech

1202
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:37,894
doesn't make you think
that you should tell the truth
about yourself.

1203
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:39,663
-I'm going to.
-Don't be silly.

1204
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:41,330
And he's gonna accept me.
He's got to

1205
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:43,299
because you can't live
with a secret like that.

1206
01:16:43,366 --> 01:16:45,902
Of course you can,
for thousands of years.

1207
01:16:46,736 --> 01:16:48,004
Don't do it.

1208
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:49,105
Big mistake.

1209
01:16:49,172 --> 01:16:50,640
Won't work.

1210
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:53,109
Well, hello there.
Now, don't tell me...

1211
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:55,845
coconut shrimps.

1212
01:16:55,912 --> 01:16:57,113
Oh, yes. Would you like one?

1213
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:58,715
Yes, thank you.

1214
01:16:58,782 --> 01:16:59,916
Do you know...

1215
01:17:00,784 --> 01:17:01,918
you're quite fetching...

1216
01:17:02,752 --> 01:17:04,821
and I'm Nigel Bigelow.

1217
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:07,657
Yes.

1218
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:10,960
I will sleep with you
because I have a thing
for father figures.

1219
01:17:11,027 --> 01:17:12,395
Well, that's great then.

1220
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,931
But in the morning, I will not
get 90 percent of your jokes

1221
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:19,635
and I will go on and on about
my dream of opening an aerobic
center in Agoura.

1222
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:26,009
Are you looking for me?

1223
01:17:26,075 --> 01:17:27,076
Missing you, actually.

1224
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:29,779
How strange.

1225
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:30,880
Not really.

1226
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:48,564
I'm just gonna say it like
it's a completely
matter-of-fact thing.

1227
01:17:48,631 --> 01:17:49,632
Guess what.

1228
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:51,100
What?

1229
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,535
I'm a witch.

1230
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:54,603
Well, guess what.

1231
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:56,372
What?

1232
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:58,274
I'm a Clippers fan.

1233
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,476
(GIGGLING)

1234
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:02,812
Yeah, it's not like it's
a big deal.

1235
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:04,814
I'm not a bad witch
and we're...

1236
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:07,250
We're getting it all out there
and we're telling the truth,
right?

1237
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:08,384
Right.

1238
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:10,219
And I'm not just a fan,

1239
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:12,388
I made the mistake of buying
court-side seats.

1240
01:18:12,455 --> 01:18:13,990
No, really. Jack...

1241
01:18:14,057 --> 01:18:15,925
Jack, I am.
I, Isabel Bigelow...

1242
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:18,227
-I'm a witch.
-Okay, great.

1243
01:18:18,294 --> 01:18:19,996
So, you're witch.

1244
01:18:20,063 --> 01:18:21,798
Come on, let's go make out
in the hall closet.

1245
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:24,100
-Jack...
-Okay, okay. I'll play along.

1246
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:25,434
Like it's an improv.

1247
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,737
Prove it.

1248
01:18:27,804 --> 01:18:29,839
RITCHIE: So, I just said
"listen, guys...

1249
01:18:29,906 --> 01:18:31,574
"I believe Cher
has another hit."

1250
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,942
-Really?
-Yeah.

1251
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:36,112
Wow! Fantastic trick!

1252
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:37,180
Not a trick.

1253
01:18:39,515 --> 01:18:41,217
Wow! How'd you do that?

1254
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:45,488
To the most powerful
witch ever.

1255
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,523
Can you make an umbrella
appear in this drink?

1256
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,458
-I can.
-Really?

1257
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:51,060
That's amazing.

1258
01:18:51,127 --> 01:18:52,228
Uh-huh.

1259
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:54,463
I had no idea you were
an amateur magician.

1260
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:57,066
Hey!

1261
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:00,804
Hey! Isabel.

1262
01:19:02,839 --> 01:19:04,307
Jack, listen to me.

1263
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:07,443
I was born a witch.
My parents are witches.
I'm a witch.

1264
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:10,046
-A real witch!
-MAN: That's right, Isabel.
You go girl.

1265
01:19:10,113 --> 01:19:11,881
(CHEERING)

1266
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:14,884
That is cool. That's great.

1267
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:17,520
You are very frustrating.

1268
01:19:19,355 --> 01:19:21,858
Do you have some
Daniel Day-Lewis thing
happening here?

1269
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:25,161
How's it going?

1270
01:19:25,228 --> 01:19:26,595
I'm leaving.

1271
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:31,467
Thank you.

1272
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:38,041
Hey there.
I have Hepatitis C.

1273
01:19:42,478 --> 01:19:43,512
Isabel!

1274
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:44,747
Isabel.

1275
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:46,515
Isabel, what's going on?

1276
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:49,118
Come back to the party.

1277
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:50,186
What are you...

1278
01:19:50,854 --> 01:19:53,022
Where are you going?

1279
01:19:53,089 --> 01:19:55,158
Wow. That's really cool.
Did props make that?

1280
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:57,726
-Jack, I keep trying
to tell you.
-Can I get your car, miss?

1281
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,429
Oh, she doesn't need her car,
she has her broomstick.

1282
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:02,498
-You think I'm nuts,
don't you?
-Of course not.

1283
01:20:02,565 --> 01:20:06,469
I know plenty of women
who carry around collapsible
broomsticks.

1284
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:07,603
I'll get the car.

1285
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,505
It won't be there.
I sent it home.

1286
01:20:09,572 --> 01:20:11,707
It looks so real. I can't even
see the buttons on it.

1287
01:20:11,774 --> 01:20:13,176
It is real.

1288
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:15,244
Flies too.

1289
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:16,880
Oh, I'd love to see that.

1290
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:18,547
-Hang on.
-What?

1291
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:20,416
(SCREAMING)

1292
01:20:25,855 --> 01:20:27,390
Put me down!

1293
01:20:31,895 --> 01:20:33,529
I kept trying to tell you.

1294
01:20:33,596 --> 01:20:35,331
(SCREAMING)

1295
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:37,934
It's no big deal, Jack.

1296
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:39,335
It's no big deal.

1297
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:41,370
This is a huge deal.

1298
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:42,705
-We can work this out.
It's just who I happen to be.
-Get away.

1299
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:43,873
Get away from me.

1300
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:45,841
You tricked me.
You put spells on me.

1301
01:20:45,909 --> 01:20:47,911
Well, only a few.
Yes, I did but...

1302
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:50,413
-I took most of them off.
-Help! Someone help!

1303
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:53,883
Ah! Jack.

1304
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,151
I thought this would be okay.

1305
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:56,619
How would it be okay?

1306
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,554
Because it's me!
It's still me.

1307
01:20:58,621 --> 01:20:59,889
I'm a little freaked
out right now.

1308
01:20:59,956 --> 01:21:01,690
I know but I can't change
what I am.

1309
01:21:01,757 --> 01:21:03,059
Are you crazy?

1310
01:21:03,126 --> 01:21:04,327
Are you even human?

1311
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:05,962
-Jack!
-Am I gonna get pregnant?

1312
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:08,031
-What?
-Because I can't get
pregnant right now.

1313
01:21:08,097 --> 01:21:09,665
How does this work?
Am I gonna get webbed feet?

1314
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:11,300
-You're hurting
my feelings now.
-Get away.

1315
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:12,801
-Shoo!
-Ow! Shoo?

1316
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,070
-Shoo?
-Shoo!

1317
01:21:14,137 --> 01:21:15,771
Now you're making me angry.

1318
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:17,740
-Go! Scat!
-You want me to leave?

1319
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,042
-Yes!
-Fine!

1320
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:20,776
-Fine!
-Fine!

1321
01:21:21,344 --> 01:21:22,478
Goodbye, Jack.

1322
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:33,589
(SCREAMING)

1323
01:21:33,656 --> 01:21:34,790
You jerk!

1324
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,902
Sorry, Mr. Wyatt.
I can't find her car.

1325
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:08,491
So, she quit. So what?

1326
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,693
-How's Jack taking all this?
-Let me just tell you guys
something.

1327
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,029
Jack Wyatt's like a jet
fighter pilot.

1328
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:14,330
Nothing rattles him.

1329
01:22:14,397 --> 01:22:16,032
I'm sure he's just at the gym.

1330
01:22:16,699 --> 01:22:17,766
-Hey.
-Okay.

1331
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,868
Stop holding my arm.

1332
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:23,106
I found this gentleman picking
up pennies out of a shopping
mall water fountain.

1333
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:24,707
Thank you so much, officer.

1334
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,709
How much do I tip
you for that?

1335
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,544
-You don't tip me.
-Hey, Jack.

1336
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:30,046
-Hey, all.
-Hey, big guy.

1337
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:31,780
-How's it going?
-What's up, Jack?

1338
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:32,948
You all right?

1339
01:22:33,016 --> 01:22:34,750
Yeah, I'm all right.

1340
01:22:34,817 --> 01:22:36,585
-I've never been better.
-Okay.
-Come on.

1341
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:39,255
What's the bottle
of ketchup for?

1342
01:22:39,322 --> 01:22:41,090
-Come again?
-The...

1343
01:22:42,225 --> 01:22:43,226
Oh...

1344
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,494
I forgot to leave it at this
diner in Mexico.

1345
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:47,163
Don't freak out on us, Jack.

1346
01:22:47,763 --> 01:22:48,764
You're fired.

1347
01:22:48,831 --> 01:22:49,965
Classic.

1348
01:22:50,033 --> 01:22:51,367
(CHUCKLING)

1349
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:54,103
-Anyone have a light?
-Right here, pal.

1350
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:56,439
Everybody, let's
just calm down.

1351
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:58,307
We've only shot two episodes.

1352
01:22:58,374 --> 01:23:00,476
We got ten weeks
before we air.

1353
01:23:00,543 --> 01:23:02,845
So, we recast.
Piece of cake.

1354
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:04,747

I have been in reruns
for 32 years!

1517
01:30:42,237 --> 01:30:44,439
I need the sizzle
of prime time.

1518
01:30:44,507 --> 01:30:46,341
I need to get this show
back on the air.

1519
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:48,076
Okay, this is very complicated

1520
01:30:48,143 --> 01:30:49,411
and unsettling, all right?

1521
01:30:49,478 --> 01:30:51,146
I don't think I understand.

1522
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:54,016
All right. Do you want the...

1523
01:30:54,082 --> 01:30:56,585
short version or
the long version?

1524
01:30:56,652 --> 01:30:59,855
Keep in mind that the long
version is in Aramaic.

1525
01:30:59,922 --> 01:31:01,323
The short version.

1526
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:02,758
You got involved with a witch

1527
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:04,426
and when you do that,

1528
01:31:04,493 --> 01:31:07,696
weird stuff happens.

1529
01:31:07,763 --> 01:31:10,633
-That's it?
-Do I have to explain
everything to you?

1530
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:12,635
Okay, here's the deal.

1531
01:31:12,701 --> 01:31:14,002
I'm not real.

1532
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:16,104
-Hmm?
-Iris is a witch...

1533
01:31:16,171 --> 01:31:18,206
-Iris is a witch?
-Don't dwell...

1534
01:31:18,273 --> 01:31:19,675
And in my opinion, that...

1535
01:31:19,742 --> 01:31:22,110
-manager of yours, Ritchie...
-What?

1536
01:31:22,177 --> 01:31:23,812
(WHISPERING)
isn't even human.

1537
01:31:23,879 --> 01:31:25,147
Now, where was I?

1538
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:27,415
-When?
-Before you walk out...
Oh, right!

1539
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,051
Who wants to be with a witch?

1540
01:31:29,117 --> 01:31:31,486
Right! Crazy crap like this
would always be happening.

1541
01:31:31,554 --> 01:31:32,888
And your point is?

1542
01:31:32,955 --> 01:31:34,489
The point is you'd never know.

1543
01:31:34,557 --> 01:31:36,091
What?

1544
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:38,326
Whether you were in love
with her or whether she just
put a spell on you.

1545
01:31:38,393 --> 01:31:41,096
-You'd never know.
-Like when you first spotted
her in the bookstore.

1546
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:42,330
Probably her idea, right?

1547
01:31:42,397 --> 01:31:43,899
No, that was my idea.

1548
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,470
-Oh, that's terrible.
-I know. I just love to blend.

1549
01:31:48,537 --> 01:31:52,575
And when you got down on your
knees and you begged her to
take the job?

1550
01:31:52,641 --> 01:31:55,844
-What are you saying?
-She probably planted
the words in your head.

1551
01:31:55,911 --> 01:31:57,546
-No way. My words.
-Mmm-hmm...

1552
01:31:57,613 --> 01:32:00,015
Yeah? What about the nose?

1553
01:32:00,082 --> 01:32:01,750
Hello!

1554
01:32:01,817 --> 01:32:03,385
Is that even really her nose?

1555
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:05,688
Of course it's her real nose.

1556
01:32:05,754 --> 01:32:07,590
All I'm saying is...

1557
01:32:07,656 --> 01:32:09,758
who wants to be with a witch?

1558
01:32:32,314 --> 01:32:33,315
I do.

1559
01:32:35,283 --> 01:32:37,085
She's going home.

1560
01:32:37,152 --> 01:32:39,988
And once a witch returns home,
she can't come back
for 100 years.

1561
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:41,590
She can't leave...

1562
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,092
I need her.

1563
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:45,694
I want her. I want Isabel.

1564
01:32:45,761 --> 01:32:47,529
Well, come on.
Let's go get her.

1565
01:32:47,596 --> 01:32:49,331
Here we go!
Let's go!

1566
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:50,599
Let's go get her!

1567
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:52,334
Follow me. Follow me!
Here we go!

1568
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,669
Come on.
Here we go!

1569
01:33:02,244 --> 01:33:04,246
Better hurry. She's leaving
right this minute.

1570
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:06,248
We've gotta stop her.

1571
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:08,350
Hey, wait. You can't drive,
remember?

1572
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:11,186
Remember that episode where
you pulled out of the driveway
and almost crashed?

1573
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:13,288
Well, that wasn't exactly me.

1574
01:33:13,355 --> 01:33:16,291
I, personally,
am a great driver.

1575
01:33:17,525 --> 01:33:19,294
Wupsy doodle.

1576
01:33:19,361 --> 01:33:21,463
-Wee!
-(SCREAMING)

1577
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:26,568
Take it easy!

1578
01:33:26,635 --> 01:33:28,570
Could you slow down
just a tad?

1579
01:33:28,637 --> 01:33:30,939
Is it "Porsche" or is
it "Porscha?"

1580
01:33:31,006 --> 01:33:32,374
Who cares? Watch the road!

1581
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,009
Please! We've gotta
get Isabel!

1582
01:33:34,076 --> 01:33:35,811
Oh, all right, party-pooper.

1583
01:33:35,878 --> 01:33:37,112
UNCLE ARTHUR: Let me drive!

1584
01:33:38,413 --> 01:33:39,514
There she is!

1585
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:41,984
-Where?
-Oh no! She's flying away!

1586
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:43,551
Pedal to the metal,
buddy boy!

1587
01:33:46,054 --> 01:33:47,222
Watch it!

1588
01:33:50,025 --> 01:33:52,527
I'm about to be killed
by a fictional character.

1589
01:33:52,594 --> 01:33:54,429
(LAUGHING)
Yes, you are.

1590
01:34:01,403 --> 01:34:02,470
We're here.

1591
01:34:02,537 --> 01:34:04,172
Here? Where?

1592
01:34:04,907 --> 01:34:06,074
Where is she?

1593
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:08,677
Our place.

1594
01:34:09,544 --> 01:34:10,713
She's at our place.

1595
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,548
Thank you.

1596
01:34:13,615 --> 01:34:15,117
Thank you, Uncle Arthur.

1597
01:34:16,551 --> 01:34:18,420
Run to her, you idiot.

1598
01:34:45,113 --> 01:34:46,448
Isabel...

1599
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:52,087
Oh, my God.

1600
01:34:52,154 --> 01:34:53,655
You're here.

1601
01:34:53,722 --> 01:34:55,223
I'm so happy you're here.

1602
01:34:55,290 --> 01:34:56,291
I'm leaving.

1603
01:34:56,358 --> 01:34:57,960
No, no, no.
You can't.

1604
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:00,128
You'll be gone forever
if you leave.

1605
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:03,065
You'll be gone a hundred years
without being able to come
back, even if you miss me.

1606
01:35:03,131 --> 01:35:04,566
That's ridiculous.

1607
01:35:04,632 --> 01:35:05,834
Who told you that?

1608
01:35:05,901 --> 01:35:07,235
He did!

1609
01:35:07,302 --> 01:35:09,271
UNCLE ARTHUR: (LAUGHING)

1610
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,042
Well...

1611
01:35:14,109 --> 01:35:15,978
What are you doing here
if you're leaving?

1612
01:35:17,746 --> 01:35:19,381
I was going home.

1613
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:20,448
But...

1614
01:35:20,515 --> 01:35:22,317
I don't know where that is.

1615
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:25,087
Home is with me.

1616
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:27,389
Don't go, please.

1617
01:35:27,455 --> 01:35:28,791
-But I'm...
-Shh...

1618
01:35:28,857 --> 01:35:30,192
We'll work it out.

1619
01:35:30,258 --> 01:35:32,127
-We can't.
-Yes we can.

1620
01:35:32,194 --> 01:35:33,628
I can't be normal

1621
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:35,497
because I'm a witch.

1622
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:37,699
I can't be a witch

1623
01:35:37,766 --> 01:35:40,468
because I really
wanna be normal.

1624
01:35:40,535 --> 01:35:41,804
It's not possible.

1625
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:43,671
Of course it's possible.

1626
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,041
There's tons of other
witches who've done it.

1627
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:48,476
Who?

1628
01:35:48,543 --> 01:35:50,712
Well, maybe not tons
of other witches, but...

1629
01:35:51,313 --> 01:35:52,580
at least one.

1630
01:35:55,150 --> 01:35:56,785
Samantha.

1631
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,955
Caught between two worlds

1632
01:36:00,022 --> 01:36:01,023
and yet...

1633
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:03,458
completely happy.

1634
01:36:03,525 --> 01:36:05,928
She lived happily ever after,
in fact.

1635
01:36:05,994 --> 01:36:09,264
Although there's no way
to be sure because she
went off the air.

1636
01:36:09,331 --> 01:36:11,366
We'll work it out.

1637
01:36:11,433 --> 01:36:13,168
Don't cry, little witch.

1638
01:36:16,939 --> 01:36:18,606
I love you, Samantha.

1639
01:36:19,641 --> 01:36:21,109
Isabel.

1640
01:36:21,176 --> 01:36:22,310
I knew that.

1641
01:36:23,311 --> 01:36:24,779
I think.

1642
01:36:24,847 --> 01:36:26,314
I love you, Darrin.

1643
01:36:39,761 --> 01:36:41,296
I just occurred to me,
you could have...

1644
01:36:41,964 --> 01:36:43,265
any guy...

1645
01:36:43,331 --> 01:36:45,633
-Uh-huh...
-in the whole world.

1646
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:48,403
Oh, but I choose you.

1647
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,006
Honestly, I think you made
a mistake.

1648
01:36:51,073 --> 01:36:53,108
If I did, I could always
get out of it.

1649
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:54,709
(MEOW)

1650
01:36:59,447 --> 01:37:00,883
Now we have things to do.

1651
01:37:00,949 --> 01:37:02,184
Mmm-hmm.

1652
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:04,019
We have a show to do.

1653
01:37:04,086 --> 01:37:05,988
-Yes.
-And then...

1654
01:37:06,054 --> 01:37:08,223
maybe after a while,
we could get married.

1655
01:37:27,642 --> 01:37:29,011
JACK: There it is!

1656
01:37:32,447 --> 01:37:33,581
Abner, come look!

1657
01:37:33,648 --> 01:37:35,417
The new neighbors
are moving in!

1658
01:37:35,483 --> 01:37:37,619
Not now, Gladys. I'm busy.

1659
01:37:38,954 --> 01:37:40,622
Ah, yes.

1660
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,959
I'm now going to carry you
across the threshold.

1661
01:37:48,196 --> 01:37:50,798
ISABEL: Don't you think
the front lawn looks
a little bare?

1662
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,134
JACK: No, I don't.

1663
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,136
ISABEL: But I think it
could use a little something.

1664
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:56,271
It's fine the way it is,
honey.

1665
01:38:03,345 --> 01:38:04,712
Abner!

1666
01:38:04,779 --> 01:38:07,249
A tree just appeared
in the front yard!
