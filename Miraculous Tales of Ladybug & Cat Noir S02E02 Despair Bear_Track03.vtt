&lrm;<i>Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

&lrm;<i>Tonight, for our first edition</i>
&lrm;<i>of Face-to-Face,</i>

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.260
&lrm;<i>you'll have the opportunity of a lifetime,</i>

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.140
&lrm;<i>the chance to talk live</i>
&lrm;<i>with Ladybug and Cat Noir!</i>

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.140
&lrm;<i>Along with me, Nadia Chamack.</i>

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.260
&lrm;<i>We'll reveal sizzling-hot information</i>
&lrm;<i>about your favourite superheroes!</i>

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.260
&lrm;<i>Don't be bemused, it's just the news!</i>

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.220
&lrm;Sizzling-hot revelations?

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.620
&lrm;Can you believe it, Tikki? An hourlong
&lrm;special about me and Cat Noir!

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.060
&lrm;-Pretty exciting, huh?
&lrm;-But, Marinette,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.260
&lrm;you're a superhero, not a star!
&lrm;You have to remain a mystery,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.500
&lrm;to protect yourself from Hawk Moth
&lrm;and all his supervillains!

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.940
&lrm;Don't worry. I only accepted this
&lrm;because I want the people of Paris

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.820
&lrm;to know that Cat Noir and I will always
&lrm;do whatever it takes to keep them safe.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.700
&lrm;Just be careful tonight, OK?

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.540
&lrm;Tonight? What do you mean?
&lrm;Tonight I have babysitting.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.860
&lrm;-The show is tomorrow!
&lrm;<i>-Don't forget, tonight! Face-to-Face,</i>

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.380
&lrm;<i>live with Ladybug and Cat noir!</i>

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.300
&lrm;And that's probably why
&lrm;you babysit tonight.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.060
&lrm;Marinette! Marinette!

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.180
&lrm;Manon! Mrs. Chamack!

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.420
&lrm;I, uh, I just saw your ad
&lrm;for your show... tonight.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.140
&lrm;Sorry, I'm running late.
&lrm;Thanks for watching Manon.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.060
&lrm;I've put lots of things for her in here.
&lrm;She's had dinner.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.060
&lrm;-I'm so glad you're free tonight.
&lrm;-Uh, yeah. I had no other plans.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.460
&lrm;-No plans at all!
&lrm;-I better get going.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.620
&lrm;A lot is riding on this interview. I need
&lrm;all of Paris in front of the screen.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.020
&lrm;Sweetie, just for tonight,
&lrm;you can watch TV with Marinette!

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.700
&lrm;Yay! Mommy will be on TV
&lrm;with Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.740
&lrm;You'll do great, Mrs. Chamack!
&lrm;Besides, you already have two viewers!

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.980
&lrm;Wish me luck!
&lrm;Tell your friends to tune in!

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.140
&lrm;I will!

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.540
&lrm;Uh, Alya?

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.340
&lrm;<i>We're on air in ten.</i>
&lrm;<i>Still no cat in sight.</i>

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.300
&lrm;<i>-Sure you have this in control, Nadia?</i>
&lrm;-Yes, Arlette. I got this, as promised.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.940
&lrm;<i>-Biggest audience of the year.</i>
&lrm;<i>-Let's hope so,</i>

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.660
&lrm;<i>if you want to keep this show</i>
&lrm;<i>on prime time in the future.</i>

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.220
&lrm;[sighs]

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.180
&lrm;Huh? How the... Which way did you come in?

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.500
&lrm;Secret celebrity door.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.300
&lrm;-I see Ladybug's running behind.
&lrm;-I thought you'd arrive together!

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.580
&lrm;-Do you wanna hear a secret?
&lrm;-Mmm-hmm.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.300
&lrm;I love chouquettes!

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.980
&lrm;<i>Is that the sizzling-hot information</i>
&lrm;<i>I've been promised?</i>

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.740
&lrm;-No! Of course not!
&lrm;-Well, you know the rules.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.500
&lrm;Prime time, prime info.
&lrm;No info, no more show.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.340
&lrm;-We're on the air in five!
&lrm;-I'm sorry. She's not picking up.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.820
&lrm;Super-Manon to the rescue! Whoo!

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.660
&lrm;To the Eiffel Tower and beyond!

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.500
&lrm;-Glad you could make it last minute.
&lrm;-Of course!

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.300
&lrm;It's way more fun watching your favourite
&lrm;superhero on TV with my favourite girls!

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.380
&lrm;<i>When we return, Nadia Chamack will be</i>
&lrm;<i>joined by Ladybug and Cat Noir,</i>

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.460
&lrm;<i>for an incredible exclusive interview!</i>

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.980
&lrm;Mommy! There's mommy!

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.580
&lrm;Why can't I get an exclusive interview
&lrm;like that for my Ladyblog?

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.460
&lrm;Oh! I forgot to,
&lrm;uh, tell my bakery something!

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.380
&lrm;They're in the parents, downstairs.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.700
&lrm;Do you mind keeping an eye on Manon?

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.340
&lrm;You mean,
&lrm;"Talk to your parents in the bakery."

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.900
&lrm;Uh... Right!, well, uh,
&lrm;sometimes it can take a while.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.380
&lrm;They don't always understand.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.940
&lrm;Actually, it's not their fault, they--

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.420
&lrm;-Marinette?
&lrm;-Yes?

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.260
&lrm;-Go!
&lrm;-Right!

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.340
&lrm;Alya is such a good friend.
&lrm;I feel so guilty about inviting her over

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.940
&lrm;just so I could leave her with Manon!
&lrm;Then again,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.900
&lrm;Alya is Ladybug's biggest fan,

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.700
&lrm;and she'd be crushed if her favourite
&lrm;superhero didn't turn up for her TV show!

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.220
&lrm;It's your choice, Marinette.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.180
&lrm;Hmm. Well...

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.460
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Ha!

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.500
&lrm;Going live in ten... nine...

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.700
&lrm;Eight seconds from
&lrm;the greatest fail in TV history.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.540
&lrm;<i>Five... four... three...</i>

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.100
&lrm;I thought you'd decided to stand me up.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.100
&lrm;And let the audience down? Never!

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.300
&lrm;I'm sorry I'm so late, Nadia.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.660
&lrm;<i>Saved by the bug.</i>

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.180
&lrm;<i>Well, now I'm counting on you</i>
&lrm;<i>to boost those ratings sky high!</i>

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.660
&lrm;<i>Make that red turn green.</i>

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.900
&lrm;Hmm.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.140
&lrm;<i>Good evening. I'm Nadia Chamack</i>
&lrm;<i>and this is Face-to-Face.</i>

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.700
&lrm;<i>For our first edition,</i>
&lrm;<i>I welcome the beloved guardians of Paris,</i>

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.780
&lrm;<i>Ladybug and Cat Noir! Hello!</i>

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.100
&lrm;<i>Thanks so much for accepting</i>
&lrm;<i>this exclusive live interview!</i>

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.620
&lrm;<i>Thank you, Nadia.</i>
&lrm;<i>We're honoured to be here!</i>

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.500
&lrm;<i>And hello to all my fans!</i>

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.940
&lrm;<i>I'm sure thousands have tuned in tonight.</i>

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.180
&lrm;<i>Don't encourage him or the cat</i>
&lrm;<i>won't stop purring all night.</i>

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.540
&lrm;<i>Don't listen to her.</i>
&lrm;<i>Bugaboo's just a spot jealous.</i>

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.700
&lrm;<i>I thought we agreed on</i>
&lrm;<i>no more Bugaboo-calling, Pussycat!</i>

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.180
&lrm;But it's so cute!

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.700
&lrm;<i>Ha, ha, ha!</i>
&lrm;<i>It's obvious you two are very close!</i>

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.900
&lrm;-Marinette is missing the whole thing!
&lrm;-What could that girl be doing?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.220
&lrm;<i>People know you,</i>
&lrm;<i>but they don't</i>&lrm; really&lrm;<i> know you.</i>

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.380
&lrm;<i>We see you saving Paris,</i>
&lrm;<i>but don't know anything else.</i>

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.860
&lrm;<i>We won't be keeping anything</i>
&lrm;<i>from you tonight.</i>

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.500
&lrm;<i>Well, we do have to keep a few secrets,</i>
&lrm;<i>including our identities, of course.</i>

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.220
&lrm;<i>Absolutely.</i>

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.260
&lrm;<i>How about we start off with questions</i>
&lrm;<i>from your biggest fans?</i>

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.260
&lrm;<i>Yup, let's do it!</i>

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.500
&lrm;<i>Hello, caller,</i>
&lrm;<i>state your name and your question.</i>

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.380
&lrm;<i>Seriously, Nadia? Surely no one else</i>
&lrm;<i>would be the first caller but me!</i>

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.780
&lrm;<i>I'm only</i>
&lrm;<i>the most prestigious fan of Ladybug!</i>

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.780
&lrm;<i>Oh, yes, of course,</i>
&lrm;<i>hello there, Chloé Bourgeois,</i>

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.180
&lrm;<i>daughter of the Mayor of Paris.</i>

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.660
&lrm;<i>And don't forget Daddy</i>

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.780
&lrm;<i>is the manager of the Grand Paris,</i>
&lrm;<i>the best luxury hotel in the entire city!</i>

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.980
&lrm;<i>Uh, thank you for reminding us.</i>
&lrm;<i>What is your question, Chloé?</i>

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.220
&lrm;<i>Oh, I don't have a question.</i>
&lrm;<i>I just wanted to say "Hi",</i>

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.940
&lrm;<i>since, as you all know,</i>
&lrm;<i>we are such very good friends,</i>

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.940
&lrm;<i>Ladybug, Cat Noir and I.</i>

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.100
&lrm;<i>Thank you, Chloé Bourgeois. Next caller.</i>

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.460
&lrm;<i>Hey! I'm not finished! Who gives you--</i>

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.060
&lrm;<i>Hi, Ladybug and Cat Noir!</i>

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.540
&lrm;<i>I'm Alya and wonder</i>

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.700
&lrm;<i>if you'd grant me</i>
&lrm;<i>an interview for the Ladyblog,</i>

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.660
&lrm;<i>since I have more viewers than Nadia!</i>

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.260
&lrm;<i>-What do you say?</i>
&lrm;<i>-Uh... Yeah, sure, Alya.</i>

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.940
&lrm;<i>-I'd love to do that.</i>
&lrm;<i>-That totally rocks!</i>

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.220
&lrm;<i>-Thank you! Thank you!</i>
&lrm;<i>-I'm on TV?</i>

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.580
&lrm;<i>-Mommy?</i>
&lrm;<i>-Manon? But where's Marinette?</i>

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.500
&lrm;<i>-She had to go tell her parents something!</i>
&lrm;<i>-Yeah. It can take a while.</i>

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.020
&lrm;What's going on, Nadia?

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.860
&lrm;Is this some kind of joke?
&lrm;Just get to the scoop, now!

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.980
&lrm;<i>Uh, Ladybug, Cat Noir...</i>
&lrm;<i>Um, so, a lot of fans think of you</i>

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.420
&lrm;<i>as a couple of superheroes,</i>

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.380
&lrm;<i>but also, and I quote,</i>

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.220
&lrm;<i>as a "couple", period.</i>

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.780
&lrm;<i>-What?</i>
&lrm;<i>-Can you confirm you're dating?</i>

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.660
&lrm;<i>I'm very sorry, Nadia,</i>
&lrm;<i>but we're superheroes.</i>

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.260
&lrm;<i>We're not here to answer</i>
&lrm;<i>such personal questions.</i>

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.100
&lrm;<i>Miaow. My ladybug's growing claws!</i>

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.660
&lrm;<i>We're here to assure</i>
&lrm;<i>all Parisians they're safe,</i>

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.140
&lrm;<i>and it's only a matter of time</i>
&lrm;<i>before we defeat Hawk Moth. That's all.</i>

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.140
&lrm;<i>-You told me you had an inside scoop!</i>
&lrm;<i>-Fine.</i>

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.180
&lrm;<i>How do you explain these photographs,</i>
&lrm;<i>then?</i>

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.460
&lrm;What? When did that happen?

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.580
&lrm;I was saving you, not kissing you!

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.420
&lrm;[Arlette]
&lrm;<i>Good job! Keep that up!</i>

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.060
&lrm;<i>It's so obvious you're both in love!</i>

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.060
&lrm;These are just a bunch of photos
&lrm;taken out of context!

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.580
&lrm;We were only doing our job.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.820
&lrm;We save the city together every day!
&lrm;We're not a couple!

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.580
&lrm;-But, hopefully, one day...
&lrm;-Cat! Not now!

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.340
&lrm;Why won't you tell the truth?

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.740
&lrm;But it is the truth, Nadia!

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.620
&lrm;Come on, the audience awaits your answer.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.380
&lrm;This interview is so over.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.580
&lrm;-Whoa! What's the rush?
&lrm;-Uh... There's an alert!

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.540
&lrm;Paris needs us right now!

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.580
&lrm;Sorry! When duty calls... Gotta go!

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.060
&lrm;<i>-Don't let them leave!</i>
&lrm;<i>-Hey! Wait, you two!</i>

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.740
&lrm;<i>The show is not over yet!</i>
&lrm;<i>Your fans will be disappointed!</i>

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.540
&lrm;<i>If they're our true fans,</i>
&lrm;<i>they'll understand!</i>

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.260
&lrm;<i>The lady is right.</i>

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.660
&lrm;<i>Beauty, comfort...</i>

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.580
&lrm;Well, say bye-bye, Nadia.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.940
&lrm;This is officially your first
&lrm;and last primetime show!

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.220
&lrm;[Nadia sobs]

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.060
&lrm;A journalist ridiculed
&lrm;by Ladybug and Cat Noir,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.900
&lrm;now that's a perfect prey!

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.180
&lrm;Fly away,
&lrm;my little akuma, and evilise her!

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.460
&lrm;[Nadia sobs]

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.500
&lrm;Prime Queen, I am Hawk Moth.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.460
&lrm;I see Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;have denied you the answers you deserve.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.260
&lrm;Steal their Miraculous
&lrm;and you will get your scoop!

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.660
&lrm;The highest ratings will be mine!

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.900
&lrm;-So, who are we saving?
&lrm;-Just us.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.020
&lrm;Nadia was willing to do anything
&lrm;for her show's success,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.620
&lrm;and I'm not about to answer
&lrm;any more questions!

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.620
&lrm;But that's the price of success,
&lrm;the price of stardom!

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.260
&lrm;We are superheroes, not stars!

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.540
&lrm;We should be doing our job,
&lrm;not looking like fools on TV!

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.180
&lrm;Wait!
&lrm;I wasn't planning to get home so early!

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.140
&lrm;Why don't we get some ice cream?
&lrm;I know the purr-fect place.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.060
&lrm;<i>It's not possible.</i>

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.660
&lrm;<i>She's a girl</i>
&lrm;<i>and she doesn't have a shampoo!</i>

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.860
&lrm;<i>What the--</i>

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.260
&lrm;Oh! My interview
&lrm;would have been so much better!

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.580
&lrm;Why can't we see Mommy on TV any more?
&lrm;And where's Marinette?

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.620
&lrm;[yawns]

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.980
&lrm;I'm sure she'll be back soon.
&lrm;Before you can say--

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.140
&lrm;[snores]

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.860
&lrm;<i>Welcome, everyone, to a new show</i>
&lrm;<i>hosted by me, Prime Queen!</i>

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.340
&lrm;<i>Ha, ha!</i>
&lrm;<i>Don't be bemused, it's just the news!</i>

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.940
&lrm;Nadia?

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.020
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.140
&lrm;<i>Tonight, Ladybug and Cat Noir</i>
&lrm;<i>disappointed all their loyal fans</i>

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.300
&lrm;<i>by refusing to admit</i>
&lrm;<i>their love for one another!</i>

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.380
&lrm;<i>I've prepared some trials</i>
&lrm;<i>to see how far they'll go</i>

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.940
&lrm;<i>to keep the truth hidden from us!</i>

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.060
&lrm;Hey! You're not allowed to come in here!

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.500
&lrm;Security!

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.220
&lrm;<i>Let's welcome our very first guest,</i>
&lrm;<i>Chloé Bourgeois,</i>

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.220
&lrm;<i>who's apparently a friend</i>
&lrm;<i>of our two superheroes.</i>

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.500
&lrm;<i>I certainly am.</i>

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.980
&lrm;Just proves you can't believe
&lrm;what you see on TV!

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.500
&lrm;Well, then, dear Chloé, let's find out
&lrm;if you can count on them as true friends!

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.020
&lrm;[screaming]

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.380
&lrm;Hey! Watch it!
&lrm;You're wrinkling my clothes!

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.340
&lrm;Do you realise how much they cost?

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.820
&lrm;[screams]

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.780
&lrm;[gasps]

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.860
&lrm;This can't be happening to me!
&lrm;I never, ever take the subway!

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.220
&lrm;It's so... so not me!

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.340
&lrm;Ugh! Gross!

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.140
&lrm;<i>Welcome to the subway of suspense!</i>

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.700
&lrm;<i>If it reaches 70 miles per hour,</i>

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.820
&lrm;<i>you can say goodbye</i>
&lrm;<i>to your precious little friend!</i>

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.540
&lrm;<i>Well, well, look here!</i>
&lrm;<i>The ratings are rising!</i>

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.660
&lrm;<i>More and more of you want to know</i>
&lrm;<i>if our superhero friends</i>

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.060
&lrm;<i>will get here in time!</i>
&lrm;<i>The suspense is</i>&lrm; killing&lrm;<i> her!</i>

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.100
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.500
&lrm;<i>Ladybug, Cat Noir,</i>

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.700
&lrm;<i>are you willing to travel through</i>
&lrm;<i>the screen to save your darling Chloé?</i>

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.340
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir, I beg you,
&lrm;save my jacket!

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.540
&lrm;Ready to take the leap, Milady?

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.940
&lrm;What if it's a trap? I think
&lrm;I'd rather get there by my own means.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.260
&lrm;There are many subway lines in Paris,
&lrm;which means a 140 miles of rails!

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.940
&lrm;If we want to get there in time
&lrm;to save Chloé, we have no choice.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.820
&lrm;-Ha! Just admit you love being on TV!
&lrm;-I don't get stage fright, Bugaboo!

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.780
&lrm;[battle cry]

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.060
&lrm;Finally! What took you so long?

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.700
&lrm;Hurry up and get me out of this
&lrm;underground nightmare! Whoa! Ugh!

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.340
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.300
&lrm;<i>You're about to be the stars of the</i>
&lrm;<i>highest-rated show in all of TV history!</i>

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.300
&lrm;The akuma must be in that watch.
&lrm;I'll deal with Prime Queen.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.220
&lrm;I'll deal with the door!

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.300
&lrm;-We're trapped!
&lrm;<i>-The rules for my show are simple.</i>

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.180
&lrm;<i>Admit the truth, live on TV,</i>

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.460
&lrm;<i>that you're dating and in love,</i>
&lrm;<i>and I'll stop the train!</i>

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.340
&lrm;A superhero never lies! We won't admit
&lrm;to something that's not true!

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.260
&lrm;<i>I want my scoop!</i>

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.340
&lrm;-I'll use my Cataclysm!
&lrm;-No, wait!

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.580
&lrm;-We might need it for an emergency.
&lrm;-Yeah. Like, right now!

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.060
&lrm;We have to lure her over here first,
&lrm;or we'll never capture her akuma.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.300
&lrm;So let's just play along with her.
&lrm;It'll buy us some time.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.540
&lrm;-Meaning?
&lrm;-OK, Prime Queen.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.540
&lrm;You win. I confess.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.980
&lrm;Cat Noir and I&lrm;<i> are</i>&lrm; dating, like you said!
&lrm;We are in love.

&lrm;[purring]

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.540
&lrm;-Did I just hear you purr?
&lrm;-Uh... No way!

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.620
&lrm;<i>Our two heroic lovebirds</i>
&lrm;<i>are saving their fan's life</i>

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.700
&lrm;<i>by admitting their true feelings!</i>

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.940
&lrm;<i>Our viewers are going crazy!</i>

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.660
&lrm;<i>But the TV ratings haven't maxed out yet.</i>

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.260
&lrm;<i>You must do better!</i>

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.340
&lrm;<i>Then come and join us, Prime Queen!</i>

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.060
&lrm;<i>You're the host and star of the show.</i>
&lrm;<i>Then you'll have your ratings!</i>

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.100
&lrm;Order them to give you their Miraculous!

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.660
&lrm;<i>My show, my rules, Ladybug!</i>

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.500
&lrm;<i>To prove your feelings are genuine,</i>
&lrm;<i>you'll have to take off your masks!</i>

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.900
&lrm;<i>Which means</i>
&lrm;<i>you must both give me your Miraculous!</i>

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.460
&lrm;-Not a chance, Prime Queen!
&lrm;-Wait!

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.540
&lrm;I know how we can prove our feelings!

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.980
&lrm;Pucker up!

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.420
&lrm;Not a chance, Kitty!

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.220
&lrm;Is the show over?

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.340
&lrm;If we can't get to her,
&lrm;we'll never capture her akuma!

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.820
&lrm;<i>My dear viewers,</i>
&lrm;<i>you're in for the reveal of a lifetime!</i>

&lrm;<i>Ladybug! Help me, please!</i>

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.140
&lrm;<i>Oh, wait! Isn't this the girl</i>
&lrm;<i>who started the famous Ladyblog?</i>

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.100
&lrm;<i>-The first one who ever filmed Ladybug?</i>
&lrm;-No! Alya!

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:22.180
&lrm;<i>Next trial, your Miraculous, or else</i>
&lrm;<i>your biggest fan will be mummified!</i>

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.060
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.220
&lrm;Let's leap in before she runs!

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.660
&lrm;Hey! Oh! Wait! What about me?
&lrm;Someone get me out of here!

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.700
&lrm;-We're not at the Louvre!
&lrm;-It was a double-cross!

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.340
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.780
&lrm;-Cataclysm?
&lrm;-There's no point.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.460
&lrm;We're far away from the Louvre.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.900
&lrm;By the time we get there,
&lrm;it'll be too late!

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.900
&lrm;So, a kiss then?

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.460
&lrm;Still not a chance, Cat Noir!

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.900
&lrm;<i>The time has come</i>
&lrm;<i>to push those ratings sky high!</i>

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.020
&lrm;<i>Let's try again.</i>

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.180
&lrm;<i>Remove your Miraculous</i>
&lrm;<i>and reveal your true selves.</i>

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.820
&lrm;<i>The whole world is watching you!</i>

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.860
&lrm;The perfect plan, Prime Queen!
&lrm;They're cornered!

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.300
&lrm;The Miraculous are mine!

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.780
&lrm;There's no use looking for a way out...

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.660
&lrm;unless you want to see
&lrm;your fan in deep water!

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.780
&lrm;[gasp]

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.540
&lrm;<i>Hurry up, you two.</i>

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.260
&lrm;<i>Don't wanna keep your audience waiting!</i>

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.020
&lrm;You're right!

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.700
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.980
&lrm;A tape roll?
&lrm;What am I supposed to do with this?

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.340
&lrm;Of course!

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.460
&lrm;-Hurry! She's about to push Alya in!
&lrm;-One minute!

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.580
&lrm;-That's too long!
&lrm;<i>-Listen to the cat!</i>

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.820
&lrm;Voilà!

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.420
&lrm;-What's happening?
&lrm;-Fine. You win, Prime Queen!

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.260
&lrm;<i>We'll remove our Miraculous.</i>

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.420
&lrm;<i>Everyone will see us without our masks!</i>

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.220
&lrm;<i>And we're about to kiss!</i>
&lrm;<i>Shame you're missing it!</i>

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.220
&lrm;So unlucky!

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.980
&lrm;<i>If you're lying,</i>
&lrm;<i>you're going to regret it!</i>

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.660
&lrm;And now you're stuck with us.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.540
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.220
&lrm;-Ladies first.
&lrm;-Thank you.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.780
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.860
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.900
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.260
&lrm;Bye, little butterfly!

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.780
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.580
&lrm;What just happened?

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.020
&lrm;Pound it!

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.940
&lrm;Prime Queen turned out to be bad news!

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.780
&lrm;But, soon, I'll be broadcasting
&lrm;the end of Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.740
&lrm;I'm so sorry, Alya!

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.500
&lrm;I had no idea it would take so long
&lrm;to talk to my parents!

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.860
&lrm;You won't believe it!
&lrm;I was taken hostage by a supervillain!

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.500
&lrm;What? You're kidding!

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.260
&lrm;No joke! You missed everything!

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.940
&lrm;Luckily, Ladybug saved me!

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.620
&lrm;I'm so sorry I wasn't here for you.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.860
&lrm;No biggie! But next time
&lrm;we decide to spend an evening together,

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.340
&lrm;you're not allowed to go
&lrm;near your parents!

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.460
&lrm;Deal!

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.380
&lrm;<i>Don't be bemused, it's just the news!</i>

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.820
&lrm;<i>Hi, I'm Nadia Chamack,</i>
&lrm;<i>and this Side-by-Side!</i>

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.620
&lrm;<i>Today, I'm joined by Alya Césaire,</i>
&lrm;<i>who created the Ladyblog!</i>

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.580
&lrm;<i>Together, we'll be looking back over</i>
&lrm;<i>Cat Noir and Ladybug's greatest feats!</i>

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.620
&lrm;<i>Your ratings are really high,</i>
&lrm;<i>Nadia, great job!</i>

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.300
&lrm;You've earned this primetime show!

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.540
&lrm;<i>Hello, Nadia! Hey, fans!</i>

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.100
&lrm;<i>So, first of all,</i>
&lrm;<i>I gotta set the record straight.</i>

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.660
&lrm;<i>Cat Noir and Ladybug are not a couple!</i>

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.900
&lrm;<i>Well, not yet, at least.</i>
&lrm;<i>Sorry to break the news!</i>

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.060
&lrm;-Hey, look! That's you with my mommy!
&lrm;-That's right, small fry!

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.300
&lrm;Well done! Now everyone's
&lrm;gonna know about the Ladyblog!

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.060
&lrm;-You want an autograph?
&lrm;-Of course!

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.780
&lrm;Oh, me first, me first!

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.900
