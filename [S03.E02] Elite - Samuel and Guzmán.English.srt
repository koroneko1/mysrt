1
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,240
GRADUATION PARTY

2
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,439
You don't have a fever.

3
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,560
-I'll take you to the doctor's.
-No, it's fine.

4
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,159
I just need to rest.

5
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,359
Up to you.

6
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,359
Still sleeping down here.

7
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,680
Omar.

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,359
I'm not in the mood now, OK?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,680
Not now, not the other day,

10
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,959
not yesterday...

11
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,079
What's going on?

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,000
You're over me.

13
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Don't say that.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,599
No? Come on, say it. You're bored.

15
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,280
Don't be a drama queen.

16
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,400
Omar.

17
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,199
I don't know, man.

18
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,319
This should be a nonstop hormone fest.

19
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,840
Fucking, kissing, going places...

20
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,159
Having fun.

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,400
-We're like a retired old couple.
-Can I talk?

22
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,400
If it's not that, what is it?

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,879
We're together, we live together.
We're more or less independent.

24
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,680
And the coolest thing we do
is watch Netflix?

25
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,680
It's a fucking joke.

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,159
Jesus, check out the hunk!

27
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,639
Too bad the new guy
didn't end up in our class.

28
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,639
Him? He's not really new.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,960
He was here on a scholarship
three years ago

30
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,240
and had to leave. His name is Yeray.

31
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,039
That's... "Free Yeray"?

32
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Yeah! That's what they called him.
I don't know why.

33
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,159
Forget about him.

34
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,800
I already have.

35
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
ROOM FOR RENT

36
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,960
Are you hanging those here?

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Samuel, people here shit 
in bathrooms as big as your house.

38
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,800
I'm just printing.
I can't afford toner.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,319
Rebe to the rescue. I'm fine, thanks.

40
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,039
Yeah, fucking great. You wish you were.

41
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,560
Your mom leaves you,

42
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,319
the marchioness screws you over,
Polo is out of jail...

43
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,520
Are you here to help
or make me feel shittier?

44
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,080
Problems should be handled
like fuck buddies:

45
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,080
one per day.

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,439
-What are you doing?
-Here.

47
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,039
I have the perfect roommate for you.

48
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,519
Hey, buddy!

49
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,920
-Sell the car and live with him all year.
-You know what, babe?

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,759
My dignity is not for sale.

51
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,160
You lost your dignity 
200 lines of coke ago, sweetie.

52
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Sorry.

53
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,519
A dignified life is having a roof, 
not a car.

54
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,399
No matter how good the car looks.

55
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Looks amazing. You know what?

56
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,639
I prefer to see the world
in my own colors,

57
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,879
not in his gray palette.
No offense. Thanks anyway.

58
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,920
What a huge idiot you are.

59
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,000
-Yeah, a giant one.
-Here.

60
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,319
For you, sir.

61
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,519
-What's this?
-This guy's number.

62
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,480
Yesterday, the school signed 
a program of studies

63
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,399
with Columbia University, in New York,

64
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,920
that guarantees access to that college.

65
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
The program and the courses
will be fully funded.

66
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,920
Candidates will present
their own academic projects

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,279
-by the end of the year, and the winner--
-Funded by whom?

68
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,600
A generous sponsor.

69
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,439
-As I was saying--
-Yesterday?

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,040
I saw Polo's mother in your office.

71
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
I mean...

72
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,879
if Polo's mom's publishing house
wants to sponsor it, so what?

73
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,319
You're always--

74
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,040
They've already bought you off.
Not the rest of us.

75
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,000
They don't need to buy us off.
Polo's been released.

76
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,920
Thank you.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,800
You want to take the prize
without feeling guilty, huh?

78
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,800
If Nadia wants to apply,
it's her business.

79
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,639
Maybe we should all move on.

80
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,480
-You're not serious.
-I believed you.

81
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,040
But the court didn't.
I believed you, not Polo...

82
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,240
who's been my best friend
my whole life.

83
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,399
Maybe I fucked up again.

84
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,319
Drop it.

85
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Were you serious?

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,519
-About what?
-Moving on.

87
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,639
Believing me.

88
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,439
Polo...

89
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,120
we've been friends for a long time.

90
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,079
For our sake...

91
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,199
look into my eyes.
Did you kill Marina or not?

92
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,199
No.

93
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,879
I didn't do it, Guzmán.

94
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,279
Then maybe I was serious.

95
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,519
I don't know. One day, Guzmán 
is looking for revenge like a viking,

96
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,160
and the next day, it's all over?

97
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,800
What do you mean?
Should I not believe him now?

98
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,800
I know you want everything
to go back to how it was...

99
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,160
but that won't happen. Ever.

100
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,920
He's trying his best.
I'm going to do the same.

101
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,720
If he believes me, I believe him.

102
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,319
Ander, how will you go to the hospital 
on your own?

103
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,360
-Walking or by bus or cab...
-Right.

104
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,560
-What about your mom? And Omar?
-They don't know and won't find out.

105
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,920
-But--
-Is that clear?

106
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,519
OK... fine.

107
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,279
But only if I can come.

108
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,560
-No way.
-No?

109
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,839
Too bad, because yours truly

110
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,360
will go to the principal's office, 
your mom's office,

111
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,840
and tell her faster
than you can buy that Coke.

112
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,200
Your call, hotshot.

113
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,679
Good morning. I'm here to fill out
the application for the study program.

114
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,440
And about time too.

115
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
May I come in? Nadia!

116
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,480
Are you applying too? Great.

117
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,759
I thought you wanted St. Andrews.

118
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,039
I do.

119
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,919
-Then why apply? This is for Columbia.
-Why not?

120
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,759
You shouldn't put all your eggs
in one basket, right?

121
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,679
With your record and your references,
you could go to any university.

122
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,159
Let's see if I understand...
You're telling me not to apply?

123
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,879
The call for applications
is open to anyone.

124
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm just saying that...
those who, fortunately,

125
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,559
can gain access to the best education
through other means,

126
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,120
could perhaps leave this opportunity
to people who are less fortunate.

127
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,240
My application. Have a good day.

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,840
Lucrecia!

129
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,679
-Hi.
-Azucena is right. You don't need it.

130
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,919
That's not your business or hers.

131
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,720
-Are you doing it just to annoy me?
-Yes.

132
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,559
Because I love to beat you.

133
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,200
It's much more fun.

134
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,360
And that pleasure is priceless.

135
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,960
Welcome to the competition... hon.

136
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,960
Let the Hunger Games begin!

137
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,240
You don't need to keep pretending.

138
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,679
You can come back to class anytime.

139
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:24,159
-I don't need your permission.
-I know.

140
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,200
But don't do it for me.

141
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,720
I'm sick of you saying what I want to hear
and then double-crossing me later.

142
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:33,519
-What do you want now?
-For you to come back.

143
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,919
It's all over.

144
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,480
Even Guzmán thinks Polo is innocent.

145
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,720
Seriously?

146
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,480
I guess when you feel lonely,
you don't want to keep losing people.

147
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,960
That's how I feel, at least.

148
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:50,679
I just want to get on with my life,
but the people I care for move away.

149
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,639
Even my mom left.

150
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,039
Polo's out...
Guzmán's getting close to him again...

151
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,639
All that shit you started,
and everything's like before.

152
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,080
No, not everything.

153
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,799
-What's changed?
-You and me.

154
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,279
You and me, what?

155
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,240
"You and me"?
There's no "you and me."

156
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,559
So let's change that.

157
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,200
I don't want to lose you too.

158
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,399
Come back, please.

159
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,720
Hi.

160
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,960
Hey.

161
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
Can I sit here?

162
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,600
Yeah, sure.

163
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,960
I can't get used to it.

164
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,039
I just want to get out of here...

165
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,159
and avoid their stares.

166
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,519
What?

167
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,840
Let's go.

168
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,600
I don't feel like being here either.
I never do, but even less so today.

169
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,559
Where should we go?

170
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,799
I don't know, out.

171
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,799
My place, my folks are out.

172
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,240
We could play video games.

173
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,360
Great! Sounds perfect to me.

174
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,840
It's important that you tell us
everything you saw.

175
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,320
Anything you think could be useful.

176
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,200
Everything. Any detail could be key.

177
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,519
Lu, since you always say you didn't send
the video of me and Guzmán

178
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,759
to the whole school,

179
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,240
I won't tell anyone about you and Valerio.

180
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,039
How do you want me to not tell?

181
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,840
A meme with a gradient background?
A GIF and little colored letters?

182
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,759
I need that study program.

183
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,120
You don't.
Withdraw from the competition immediately.

184
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,919
Wow. You really are smart.

185
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,639
It takes a very special person
to carry out that sort of threat.

186
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,879
My dear, you're incapable of such a thing.

187
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,759
May the best one win.

188
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,000
Kisses.

189
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,679
Bitch.

190
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,159
Beer at this hour?

191
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,559
Who cares? It's the plan that matters.

192
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,759
What?

193
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,200
Nothing, I just...

194
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,879
never thought we'd do this again.

195
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,840
Sorry for getting mushy, but...

196
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,120
I just wanted things
to be like before so bad.

197
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,799
Thank you.

198
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Come on, now you're getting mushy.

199
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,919
Drink your beer.

200
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,559
You're back.

201
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,000
I have the best reheated macaroni
on the planet at home.

202
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,799
When are you coming for dinner?

203
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,960
Fuck.

204
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,039
Do I know you?

205
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,120
Sorry.

206
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,759
Shit. What?

207
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,840
What?

208
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,279
Ander, fucking say something. 
Sing, dance, but lighten up a bit.

209
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,840
You're a pain in the ass.
I'm an introvert, okay?

210
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,320
-You're the definition of pigheaded.
-You shouldn't be here.

211
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,279
-You're right. It should be your mom--
-Stop it!

212
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,240
They'll tell me what the treatment is.
It'll be no big deal, and I'll go home.

213
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,480
I don't see the fucking need
to tell everyone.

214
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,519
Well...

215
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,240
you told me.

216
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,080
I mean people who love me.

217
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,440
Hey! I love you.

218
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,919
-You don't love me. I turn you on.
-It's a form of love, hot stuff.

219
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,720
See how good it feels 
when you lighten up a bit?

220
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,879
Tell me about you.

221
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,480
Tell me a secret nobody knows.
Since you know mine...

222
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,960
Well...

223
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,240
I mean, it's something, but it's not...

224
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,600
I think there's...
a girl who turns me on too.

225
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,919
Congrats!

226
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,799
-Nadia, right?
-No way.

227
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,519
Worse. The marchioness.

228
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,680
That's normal. She turns me on too.
Even turns Omar on!

229
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,720
What about boys?

230
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,359
Who?

231
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,160
Samuel.

232
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,079
-I don't believe you.
-It's true.

233
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,839
I mean, he's hot.

234
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,160
I'd do him.

235
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,839
Ander Muñoz?

236
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,279
You can come in.

237
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,799
WHAT IS CHEMOTHERAPY?

238
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,960
Acute lymphocytic leukemia
is a fast-growing cancer.

239
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,680
That means we have to be faster.

240
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,759
We'll start chemo this week.

241
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,359
We'll hit it with everything we've got.

242
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,480
We'll do two six-week cycles,

243
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,079
but they'll feel longer than that,
to be honest.

244
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,519
With such intensive treatment,
the side effects will also be intense.

245
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,920
It's all on that brochure,
but it won't be easy to prevent fatigue,

246
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,480
nausea, vomiting, and dizziness...

247
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,599
Also, nerve pain at the joints.

248
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,119
You won't feel like eating,
going out, or doing anything.

249
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,599
And, yes...
your hair will probably fall out.

250
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,200
It's the first thing everyone asks.

251
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,680
Over the next few months...

252
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:37,960
Ander?

253
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,480
Yes, Rebe. I'll tell them.

254
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,880
OK? As soon as I get home. I promise.

255
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
Yeah, that too.

256
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,680
But, I mean...

257
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,559
You'll die of old age.
You know that, right?

258
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,839
Carla.

259
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,960
Are you OK?

260
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,319
Excuse me?

261
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,920
You were never one to skip
so many days of school and...

262
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,359
-Well, I'm here if you need anything.
-So...

263
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:17,079
you keep staring at me in the hallway,

264
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,640
you know I don't skip classes,
you know my name...

265
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:24,880
You've only been here for two minutes,
and you're already creeping me out.

266
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,799
Sorry,
I didn't want to bother you... but...

267
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:33,720
-do you really not remember me?
-Creeping me out big time.

268
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,559
Three years ago,
I uploaded a picture to Instagram,

269
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,279
and I got ridiculed and body shamed
by half the school.

270
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,400
Body shamed? You?

271
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,039
Well, I used to be...

272
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,440
Well...

273
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,720
That's you?

274
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,880
-Yeah.
-Shit.

275
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,960
"You disgusting fat fuck."

276
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,599
“I'd donate some clothes,
but they wouldn't fit."

277
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,119
-OK, I get the picture.
-Wait.

278
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,160
Read... this comment.

279
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,920
"You are the ones who are disgusting.

280
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,480
We hate someone
when they represent something

281
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:16,880
we hate in ourselves.

282
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,119
Yeray, ignore them
and keep showing yourself as you are.”

283
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,279
I posted this?

284
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
Shit. I didn't know I was so intense.

285
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,359
When I saw a girl like you
defending me in public...

286
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,319
What do you mean, a girl like me?

287
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,240
Pretty...

288
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,160
Intelligent...

289
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,559
-A marchioness!
-I can't take credit for any of that.

290
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,880
But for defending me, you can.
It helped a lot.

291
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,079
I'm glad I helped you three years ago.

292
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,640
You bet it all on black, and you won.

293
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,480
By the way...

294
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,319
it's time to collect your prize, right?

295
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,000
Well...

296
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,680
I'm not too big
on prizes right now, but...

297
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm happy to see you again, Yeray.

298
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,960
We'd made up.

299
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,920
I realized there was no real evidence
against him.

300
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,039
Only my desire to blame him.

301
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,240
So we talked it over 
and gave each other a second chance.

302
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
After all, he was my childhood friend.

303
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,279
I never would've hurt him.

304
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,160
I'm going to make it, right?

305
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,319
Well, of course you are.

306
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,240
I'm crying because I'm still shocked,
but of course you'll make it.

307
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,480
You're not saying that
because you're my mom?

308
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,160
Of course I am.

309
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
I won't leave you alone for a second.

310
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,039
But you're going to make it
and get better.

311
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,920
Go on, honey. Tell him.

312
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,240
This is about teamwork...
and we need to start now.

313
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,440
Fuck, Ander, I asked you yesterday!

314
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
I didn't want to tell you.

315
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:08,319
But it'll get obvious, and my mom 
will have to deal with it, so I told her.

316
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,039
And I won't?

317
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,079
-No.
-What?

318
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,039
This isn't your problem, Omar.

319
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,160
OK, it is. We're together...
but we haven't known each other long.

320
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,160
We hooked up because we were less
than 500 meters apart in the app.

321
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,079
Otherwise, we wouldn't have met.

322
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,400
Two days later, you moved in!

323
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,079
Am I right?

324
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,880
Are you pushing me away
to play the romantic hero?

325
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,359
To save me from the pain
or some shit like that?

326
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,559
I'm relieving you of a burden
that isn't yours. That's all!

327
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,279
You should be out and about, fucking!
That's what you should be doing!

328
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,240
You said it yourself...

329
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,960
You should be at a nonstop hormone fest,
not here with me!

330
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,279
Do you want me to leave?

331
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,039
Whenever you want.

332
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,400
This is quite a party 
you're having here, huh? I love it!

333
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
My mom's business meetings
turn into parties.

334
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,759
Happens every week. Typical.

335
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:07,200
-What do you want?
-A quick favor.

336
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,480
-I need you to help me out.
-Money?

337
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,319
-Pass. Sell the car.
-Not money.

338
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,079
Co-caine!

339
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,680
You're joking, right?

340
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,960
No, Rebe. It's a favor,
and favors are returned.

341
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,960
So don't worry.

342
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,160
I know shit goes down at your house.

343
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,799
Rebe, bring the good gin from the cellar.

344
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,680
Honey, I told you to let me know
if you're bringing a date.

345
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,240
-A date? He's not a date.
-Valerio, ma'am. 

346
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm Rebe's classmate.

347
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,240
I'm Sandra...

348
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,640
not "ma'am." We're like family.

349
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,759
What family? You just met him.

350
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,200
It's a pleasure, Sandra.

351
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,079
What are we celebrating, then?

352
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,720
Nothing, just drinks and snacks
with friends.

353
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,079
Sounds like fun.

354
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,039
-Why didn't you mention it?
-All right, I'll get the gin.

355
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,279
-You, go the fuck home.
-Language!

356
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,519
I taught you some fucking manners!
Ignore her. I'm in charge here.

357
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,000
-Would you like a drink?
-Hell no.

358
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,400
Of course I would.
How could I say no to such a proposal?

359
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,759
She seems to be the one in charge here!

360
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,039
Guzmán... listen to me.

361
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,920
School's out. They'll see he's missing.

362
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,400
When they see you and I are gone--

363
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,319
He'll tell us where the trophy is,
then he'll go to jail.

364
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,400
How do we make him confess?

365
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,519
The towel will prevent any marks.

366
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,559
Did you set this up?

367
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,359
You had to make your mom believe 
you were dead.

368
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,359
I didn't have a choice either.

369
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,519
Polo!

370
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,599
Wake up! Come on, wake up.

371
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,039
Some of your classmates

372
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,920
say that you were...
very aggressive with him tonight.

373
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,640
I didn't do it.

374
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,480
But if I knew who did,
I wouldn't tell you.

375
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,599
That means you know.

376
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,400
That means I'd never tell you.

377
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,240
Carla.

378
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,079
How are you?

379
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,359
Fully recovered?

380
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,599
I'm going upstairs. I'm a bit tired.

381
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,400
One thing, darling.

382
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,680
This kid... Samuel...

383
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,000
What?

384
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,039
You ran your mouth off
when you thought he was gone,

385
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,880
you went back to school
when he asked you to...

386
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,079
He's controlling you.

387
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,279
How unlike you.

388
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,200
He's not good for you,

389
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,119
and it's not good for him
if I see him near you.

390
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,240
Get some rest.

391
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,440
Tell me where the trophy is.

392
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:45,160
Polo, tell me where the trophy is,
and this hell will be over for us,

393
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,160
over forever.

394
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
Put it on silent.

395
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,480
MOM

396
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,240
Polo...

397
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,839
tell me where the trophy is.

398
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:19,680
Polo...

399
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,720
please... tell me where the trophy is.

400
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,000
-Tell me!
-Guzmán, stop!

401
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,119
Fucking stop!

402
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,319
Stop!

403
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,599
Kill me.

404
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,759
I...

405
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,440
didn't want to kill her.

406
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,480
It was an accident, Guzmán.

407
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:51,880
Son of a...

408
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,759
But you're doing this to me on purpose.

409
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,559
You're capable of killing me.

410
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,720
Guzmán!

411
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,960
-Guzmán, stop it!
-I'm not a murderer!

412
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,559
Let him go!

413
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,240
Guzmán, let him go!

414
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,480
-Let him go!
-Fuck!

415
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,200
-Where are you going?
-Let go!

416
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:38,839
-What are you going to do?
-Are you protecting him?

417
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:49,119
How's the party going?
We're having a great time, right?

418
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:53,480
Mrs. Robinson...

419
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,599
Are you trying to seduce me,
or is it just me?

420
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,920
I saw you hogging the coke
as if it was yours.

421
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,359
There’s nothing I enjoy more
than entertaining my guests,

422
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,079
and there’s nothing I hate more
than being hustled in my own home.

423
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,039
Forgive me, Sandra.

424
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,279
I don't want you to think
I'm ungrateful or rude.

425
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,160
I wanted some,
and I've been a little low on cash lately.

426
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,680
All that private school and fancy clothes,
and in the end...

427
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,559
-How old are you?
-Nineteen.

428
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,200
OK... you're old enough to vote.

429
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,240
You want it?

430
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,839
Yes, I'd like a little.

431
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,200
How badly?

432
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,680
It helps me feel better about myself.

433
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,519
How badly?

434
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,240
A lot.

435
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,599
One gram.

436
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,640
Undress.

437
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,079
Come on.

438
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,279
Two grams.

439
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,119
On your knees in front of me.

440
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,240
Didn't you want it a lot?

441
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,839
Let's see what's "a lot."

442
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,079
I'm cutting you a good deal.

443
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,519
Come over here.

444
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,239
Three grams.

445
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,039
Look at you...

446
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,760
Do yourself a favor. Look at yourself.

447
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,119
Get out of here.

448
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,480
It'd be your word against ours.

449
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,239
I'M INCAPABLE, RIGHT?

450
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,400
THIS IS A COUNTDOWN.

451
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,039
You're bluffing, right?

452
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,800
Ten, nine...

453
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,480
Do you want to see if I'm bluffing?

454
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,719
...five, four...

455
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,960
You're not withdrawing?

456
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:24,440
I'll start by telling her.

457
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,519
She'll love it.

458
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
She'll spread it in no time.

459
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,599
Have a good day... dear.

460
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,639
Nadia.

461
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,880
I can't withdraw.

462
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,760
I need it as much as you do.

463
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,440
My father knows.

464
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,960
I'm an embarrassment to my family.

465
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,760
They cut me off. I have no money, Nadia.

466
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,960
Right. Am I supposed to believe that?

467
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,840
I'm not lying to you, Nadia.

468
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,119
You don't know how fucking awful it is...

469
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,440
to show you my feelings.

470
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,239
But I have no choice.

471
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,199
I need...

472
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,400
that scholarship, Nadia.

473
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,000
And I won't rest until I get it...

474
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,679
even if... I need to grovel.

475
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,840
If you knew about me what I know 
about you, would you use it to win?

476
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,519
Probably.

477
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,440
But I hope you won't do it...

478
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
because you're better than me
that way.

479
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:07,960
Only that way.

480
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:21,800
YESTERDAY WAS A SHITTY DAY

481
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,920
I NEED TO BE WITH YOU

482
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,239
WAIT FOR YOU AFTER THE BELL?

483
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,360
Are you OK, Guzmán?

484
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,960
You applied to Polo's moms' program.

485
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:47,079
It didn't bother you before.

486
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,239
It's complicated.

487
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,239
With you, everything is.

488
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,199
Everything's easy with you?

489
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,880
No... I guess not.

490
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,199
You know the feeling of waking up
and not knowing where or who you are?

491
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,519
I feel that every day.

492
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:11,559
I suddenly remember
that my sister's dead...

493
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,480
but I also remember
you'll be in class when I come in.

494
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,119
And that's the only reason
I get out of bed.

495
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,159
You don't make my life difficult.

496
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,559
Actually, you saved it.

497
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,559
That video made me...

498
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:41,639
lose a scholarship.

499
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,480
My future.

500
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:49,360
I also could've lost
my family, my home, my life...

501
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,960
I know it wasn't your fault...

502
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,320
but every time we're together...

503
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,360
Good luck with that program.

504
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,920
COFFEE? TEA? CHAMOMILE? ROOIBOS?

505
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,880
I'M WILLING TO READ OFF
THE WHOLE DRINK MENU...

506
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,639
I'm fine.

507
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,760
First time and first session?

508
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,320
I'm Alexis.

509
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,039
If you need any tips or advice
on how to handle this,

510
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,000
or need to trash-talk someone...
you know where I am.

511
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,079
Thank you.

512
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,159
See you later.

513
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,440
Bye.

514
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,559
Hi.

515
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,599
I'll get you some juice.

516
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,800
The nurse said you may have
a metallic taste in your mouth.

517
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,760
Are you staying?

518
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,159
I'll see where I end up tomorrow.
But for now, I'm here.

519
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,400
I won't hold your hand.
You want to be tough.

520
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,440
It hasn't been long, but I know you.

521
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,000
This takes three hours, right?

522
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:49,760
Did you bring your charger?
My battery's running low.

523
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,880
COLUMBIA PROGRAM
ADMITTED STUDENTS LIST

524
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,320
So?

525
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,440
I'm not doing anything. I wasn't going to.

526
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,719
Welcome to the competition.

527
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,760
Let the Hunger Games begin.

528
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,960
LET'S HAVE THAT COFFEE

529
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,440
Hey! Yes...

530
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,280
I do feel like collecting my prize.

531
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,719
Or at least trying it.

532
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:34,159
Text me, OK?

533
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,320
Want to come with me
to my startup's IPO?

534
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,440
Sure. No idea what that is,
but it sounds great.

535
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,519
-Just text me.
-OK.

536
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:01,360
Hey, still looking for a roommate?

537
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,239
Everything's good with me, now that
I have a roommate. All good. You?

538
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:16,119
What's wrong?

539
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,800
I can't say. It's about a friend.

540
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:25,920
If I tell you, he'll kill me...
before he dies himself.

541
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,000
What?

542
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:32,760
Life flies by, Samu.

543
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,320
We think we'll fucking live forever,

544
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,360
so we keep bitching about stuff
or listening to other people's shit.

545
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:45,719
What about my shit?

546
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:49,159
Nobody listens to that.

547
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,960
Not even me.

548
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:55,480
And before I know it,
maybe it'll be too late...

549
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:57,480
and my time will be up.

550
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,679
I don't want it to be too late.

551
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:06,119
I don't want to regret not doing
what I want.

552
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:08,400
So do it. 

553
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,519
Do whatever you want to do.

554
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,320
Right.

555
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,559
I dove into a pool with no water.

556
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,400
Happens sometimes.

557
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,920
Well, all the time.

558
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:44,960
No...

559
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,000
Not all the time.

560
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,679
Call an ambulance, please!
Call an ambulance!

561
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:36,079
Polo!

562
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,079
Polo.

563
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:40,360
Polo.

564
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,199
