1
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:28,957
Usamanee!

2
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:35,125
Trichada!

3
00:01:48,582 --> 00:01:49,667
How did you do that?

4
00:01:58,082 --> 00:02:01,207
They said there are ghosts here.

5
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:03,250
-You've seen one?
-Nah.

6
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:05,875
But everyone who walks down
this hallway has seen them.

7
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,042
You've walked down here?

8
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,957
Why would I?
You want to walk here by yourself?

9
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,500
-Kik!
-Just kidding!

10
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:29,417
I told you not to taunt them.

11
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,082
Hold on!

12
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:33,542
Listen!

13
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,500
-What's that?
-Where's it coming from?

14
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:41,457
There!

15
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:43,707
Hey!

16
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:46,832
-Why don't you come with me!
-No! You go!

17
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,125
You want to know? Then check it out.

18
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,542
-Come on.
-No! I'm scared!

19
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,957
You go check it out.

20
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:02,500
-It's a ghost!
-What did you see?

21
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,000
-What's the matter?
-Ghost!

22
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:04,957
What ghost?

23
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:06,343
Ghosts aren't real.

24
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:17,167
-What?
-There's nothing here.

25
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:20,792
Then why did you scream?
Junior, your turn.

26
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,375
Are you messing with me?

27
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,542
Fine. I'll show you my dance moves.

28
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:58,167
Pancake, where are you?

29
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:02,082
Please come and rest
your spirit inside this glass.

30
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,457
-Put your finger on it.
-Sadhu.

31
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:09,000
I call forth Pancake's spirit.
Come reside in this glass.

32
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,125
If you don't like it in there,
outside is fine.

33
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:13,750
Shut up, bitch!

34
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:16,958
-What do you keep repeating that for?
-Thank you.

35
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,708
Hey, I'm not pushing!
Are you pushing?

36
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,833
-I'm not!
-Me neither!

37
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,291
-Nobody's pushing. You?
-Yeah. It's me.

38
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,666
What? You asshat!

39
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,125
Why the hell did you push it?

40
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,125
Well, it didn't move one bit.
I just wanted to help.

41
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:39,291
Just touch it lightly.
And hold still. Okay?

42
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,083
Touch it lightly. Very gently.

43
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,583
-It's moving!
-How can it be?

44
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,125
How is this possible?
Where is it going?

45
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,000
-What!
-O... H...

46
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,800
Damn!

47
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,958
Oh, my God! Usamanee!

48
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,541
You think some random spirit
can stop me? Not gonna happen!

49
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,416
You really think you can hide
from me in that room?

50
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,500
Come on in if you dare.

51
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,958
What? There's a monk?

52
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,541
-Father.
-Hmm?

53
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,166
I came here to tell you.

54
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,500
-I'm renouncing from the monkhood.
-What?

55
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,583
Why do you want to renounce so soon?

56
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,958
I've done my part, dedicating
my merits to Namning and Pancake.

57
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,833
-Who is this?
-My friend.

58
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,666
-Pancake!
-Sis!

59
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,958
It's me, Panda. Pancake's sister.
You guys can never tell us apart.

60
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,125
Pancake got nothing on me.

61
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:03,875
Hello Patcharapa, Areeya, and Cherman.

62
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:05,833
Hi, Phookan.

63
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,458
Oh! Reverend.

64
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,166
Panda!

65
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,416
-Hey, you foul-mouthed!
-You're being out of line here, Panda.

66
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,250
I'm Pancake, not Panda.

67
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,041
Huh! You all go by pretty names now.

68
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,666
They don't even suit your ugly hag faces.

69
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,000
Hey.

70
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,416
I've been calling you.
Why didn't you come and help us?

71
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,166
Oh, come on!

72
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,708
Calling me into that tiny glass?
Look at my body!

73
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,125
You're supposed to
summon me where I died.

74
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,958
Pancake, so where was it exactly?

75
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,791
What am I doing on the floor?

76
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,416
Stop playing innocent, bitch!

77
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,250
Why did you say that?

78
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,125
I never thought
you would say such a thing to me.

79
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,791
The guardian spirit here is intimidating.

80
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,000
The wind's so strong!

81
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,041
I thought outside was scary.

82
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,416
Inside's a hell of a lot scarier.

83
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,000
All these antiques.

84
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,208
But you have no idea how fierce I am.

85
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,041
I'm not a wimp.

86
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:48,625
Piano ghost! Piano ghost! Piano ghost!

87
00:08:57,832 --> 00:08:58,750
That was frightening!

88
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:19,893
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!

89
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:22,457
Madame. It's me, Poi.

90
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,457
Don't you remember?

91
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,125
You showed up out of nowhere.
I almost had a heart attack.

92
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:29,292
This place is creepy. You are creepy.

93
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:30,457
Damn!

94
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:33,876
I thought you were arriving at 4 p.m..
Why do you show up so late?

95
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:35,792
It's you who showed up all of a sudden.

96
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,750
Scared me witless.

97
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,707
I'm sorry, Madame.

98
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,625
Alright. But don't ever do that again.

99
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,082
-Jeez! Look at your outfit!
-Oh, you've just arrived?

100
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,457
-Hello, Aunt.
-Hello, dear.

101
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,875
You'd better improve your sense
of fashion. Take me as an example.

102
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:52,332
Come on. Let's go. I want a fresh shower.

103
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,457
Today's so damn hot.

104
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:10,375
Walking alone at night...

105
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:14,332
-Aren't you scared?
-Not really.

106
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:17,875
But this place is haunted.

107
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:20,250
There are ghosts here?

108
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,625
Definitely. And they're frightening!

109
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,250
Turn on the light if you don't believe me.

110
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,792
Gotcha!

111
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,125
Holy shit!

112
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,332
Ghost face!

113
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,000
Scared the hell out of me!

114
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,042
Oh, my!

115
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,082
What are you afraid of?

116
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,707
Right in my face!

117
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,207
What's so scary?

118
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:07,750
How could we know where Pancake died?

119
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,875
It's been more than 20 years.

120
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:12,000
Twenty years, my ass!

121
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:14,457
She just died two years ago.

122
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:15,957
Sorry.

123
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:17,417
So you don't even know

124
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:19,125
where she died?

125
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:21,667
Damn! I can barely understand your accent.

126
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:23,832
We forgot!

127
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,917
-Phookan, you just woke up?
-Yes.

128
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,625
Did your aunt arrive yet?

129
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,707
-She got here last night. Still sleeping.
-Oh, okay.

130
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,457
Where are you going?

131
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,667
I'm going to check the apartments. Bye.

132
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,667
Now I remember where Pancake died.

133
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:05,000
So solid!

134
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,457
Shaking wouldn't help.

135
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,000
Where are you going?

136
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:52,417
-Where are you taking us?
-Just follow me.

137
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:54,832
Right here. Right here.

138
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,875
Pancake wasn't raped and killed.

139
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:02,706
She hit her head on the toilet bowl.

140
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,125
Toilet bowl?

141
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,875
Her spirit must be here.

142
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,375
Pancake.

143
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:14,792
Please come help us.

144
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:24,792
She's long gone. Why is it still stinky?

145
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:26,542
This is not an old smell.

146
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,417
This is a fresh one.

147
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:31,667
Definitely not me.

148
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,250
Why are you sniffing my face?

149
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:35,292
Where does that smell come from?

150
00:13:36,457 --> 00:13:39,500
Yeah. Take a look inside.
Get in closer. Closer.

151
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:48,042
How's my face?

152
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,875
You look the same... like a frigging lion.

153
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,707
Like Singto The Star?

154
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,332
Like the lion from Narnia.

155
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,417
The same old one.

156
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:58,250
You lizard!

157
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:01,167
I look like a lizard?

158
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,125
I look like Varanus.

159
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,917
My parents would be so proud.

160
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,538
Their daughter looks like a lizard.

161
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:14,500
Pancake, please come help us.

162
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,875
Usamanee's been haunting us day and night.

163
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:20,957
Pancake.

164
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,417
-Oh!
-Dad?

165
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:24,957
What are you doing in here?

166
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:26,750
Nothing.

167
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,582
You left the temple already, Khoi?

168
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
-Yes.
-Oh, how I missed you!

169
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:35,457
I missed you so much.
Let me give you a kiss.

170
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:37,917
Oh! You are so stinky!

171
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,207
What? Are you disgusted by me?

172
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,375
Just kissing her nephew.

173
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:47,582
Hey, Phookan. Any new tenants?

174
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:49,917
No. It's so quiet, Aunt Chupacabra.

175
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:51,292
Patcharapa.

176
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:54,417
Phookan! Today...

177
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,207
My Lord.

178
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:04,250
Oh, My Lord.

179
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:07,792
Do you remember me? I'm Phayoon.

180
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,917
Grandma's fainting! Help her out!

181
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:12,250
Please don't die in our building.

182
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:16,582
-And you are...?
-My Aunt Phayoon.

183
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,417
-Who arrived last night?
-Yes.

184
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,000
Thought this was your uncle.

185
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,875
I'm curious. Are there ghosts here?

186
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:26,792
As soon as you guys arrived, we got two.

187
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,125
-Right.
-Oh, okay.

188
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,250
It's me, Poi.

189
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,625
-Hey, give it to him!
-To the left!

190
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:35,917
Damn!

191
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:38,207
Boys will be boys. Rowdy as usual.

192
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,457
Careful... Careful...

193
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,667
Careful. Right there!

194
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,457
-Now you're done, Usamanee!
-Yes?

195
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,792
-Did you just call me?
-Not you!

196
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:08,082
You think you can get away from me?

197
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:11,167
Pick it up.

198
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:15,667
-There.
-Hey, pass us the ball!

199
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,207
Sorry, Ma'am.

200
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:20,917
Come on!

201
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:24,292
You're done.

202
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,082
Where did you throw the ball?

203
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,000
-Oh!
-Uhh!

204
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:38,875
-It's not me.
-Come on, man.

205
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,207
Sadhu. Pancake,

206
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,042
where have you been?
Why don't you show up?

207
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:49,042
Anything you want, you can pray to us.

208
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,207
Cherman, Pancake is a ghost now.

209
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:56,125
You're the one who prays to her.

210
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,250
Not the other way around.

211
00:16:58,707 --> 00:16:59,707
Is that right?

212
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,917
-If you're confident, then yes.
-Nope.

213
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,541
-So you're wrong.
-Pancake, I was confused. I'm sorry.

214
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,208
Everyone! It's all gone!

215
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,416
What's gone?

216
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,375
-The spirit house.
-The spirit house is gone?

217
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,666
We're damned!

218
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,791
It's a wreck! Who did this? Who?

219
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:21,166
-It must be you guys, right?
-I didn't do it!

220
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,916
-Aunt Phayoon did it.
-That's impossible.

221
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,291
You guys are the ones who play basketball.

222
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,500
Just get a carpenter to fix it.

223
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,166
Oops!

224
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:43,125
-Well, what do you--
-Goddammit! How annoying!

225
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,875
That's it. That's enough.

226
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,375
Can't you see? It's not Phayoon.
She looks so innocent.

227
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,333
-That's impossible.
-Of course it's her.

228
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,750
Kik told us so.

229
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,666
You threw the ball at the spirit house.

230
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,041
I didn't do anything.

231
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,416
Umm, I just... came back...

232
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,416
from... umm... my workout.

233
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,958
I started yawning at eight...

234
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,750
Then fell asleep at seven.

235
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,541
-Come again?
-I just came back.

236
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,166
At 8 p.m.,

237
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,125
I started yawing and fell asleep at seven.

238
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,541
See? She looks like she just woke up.

239
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,416
Her lashes are so on point because
she's been sleeping this whole time.

240
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,125
Kik, you again.

241
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:33,458
-It's true!
-Enough with your nonsense.

242
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,541
-Dad, just go back to bed.
-My Lord.

243
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,125
Phayoon.

244
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,166
What are you doing? Please get up.

245
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,250
That's bold of her.

246
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,125
People here are strange. Weird looks.

247
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,083
Weird stares. All-round weirdos.

248
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,750
It takes one to see one.

249
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,083
Alright. Just get back to your own room.

250
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,458
-What a bunch of weirdos!
-They're acting weird too.

251
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,708
Okay. Stop knocking.

252
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,458
-Poi, did you kick my ass?
-I didn't do anything.

253
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,125
I'm just coming out of the room.

254
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,208
See? I told you it's not me.

255
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,166
Oh, you're so sneaky.

256
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,208
You tiptoed behind me and kicked my ass.

257
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,166
How dare you!

258
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,750
Madame Phayoon.

259
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,958
You mess with the wrong person.

260
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,541
No... I'm not...

261
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,250
Phayoon. I am...

262
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,416
Pha-om

263
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,708
As in Pha-ued-pha-om.

264
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,083
Why stutter now?

265
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,166
No, no. I'm not.

266
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,083
H... help!

267
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,833
Prime Minister, please help me.

268
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,458
Poi! Poi! Oh, no!

269
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,916
It's not me! I didn't do it!

270
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,375
No! It's not me!

271
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,666
We dedicate to you
a whole new set of seven-color stripes.

272
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,250
May we all live together in peace.

273
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,208
Dear spirits, please forgive us
for our wrongdoings.

274
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,458
Yes.

275
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:29,833
We prepared
all of these offerings for you.

276
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,166
Yes.

277
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,416
Those who have wronged you,
you can break their necks.

278
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,458
-Yes.
-No! Don't!

279
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,791
You're acting suspicious.

280
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,833
What? I never do anything suspicious.

281
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,125
Stop judging me.

282
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,083
I just think that
breaking necks is too cruel.

283
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,791
It seems morbid! Horrifying!

284
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,250
You have such a pure heart.

285
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,291
You look like a nightmare but you're kind.

286
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,500
I'm dying to know.

287
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,208
-Where did she get the hair clip?
-Thrift shop.

288
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,250
-How cheap!
-Shut up, you snob!

289
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:07,000
You guys! It's Poi!

290
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,041
We found her upstairs!

291
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,625
Poi is dead?

292
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,166
Oh, Poi!

293
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,416
You shouldn't have
been strangled to death like that!

294
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,791
Oh, you poor thing!

295
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,875
Phayoon, how do you know she's dead?

296
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:23,333
-How?
-Um...

297
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,500
I guessed.

298
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,041
Just a guess.

299
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,000
You're acting suspicious again.

300
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,250
What? No! It's nothing.

301
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:33,291
Didn't do anything.

302
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,666
Poi is really dead!

303
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,000
Poi!

304
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,916
Poi is dead! Oh, no!

305
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,458
I just saw you alive and well.

306
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,750
Poi!

307
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,666
Who killed her?

308
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,791
Or was it...

309
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,916
Usamanee! Oh, Poi!

310
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You shouldn't have died!

311
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,958
No, no, no... Poi is dead! No!

312
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:11,375
You always took care of me. No!

313
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,750
Pancake! You show your face,

314
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,250
as soon as I arrive?

315
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,416
-Hello.
-Hello?

316
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,817
Not your business!

317
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:08,250
-I'm sorry. You probably...
-Sorry?

318
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,000
You sure are sorry.

319
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,666
I'm sorry. You probably
mistake me for someone else.

320
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:13,916
I might be mistaken.

321
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,833
But my hands never miss.

322
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,291
Remember those durian rinds?

323
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,875
This bitch is a ghost from Thailand.

324
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,694
She's gonna haunt you, sweetheart.

325
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,416
You sly devil!

326
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,458
-Get up!
-Pull her up!

327
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,000
We're just arrived two seconds ago...

328
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,291
He's mine, bitch! Can't you see?

329
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:49,625
It's not me!

330
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,500
-Grab her!
-Thieves?

331
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,041
Cartoon! Stop! Don't hurt her!

332
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,958
What's going on in here?

333
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:01,166
What? She's not Pancake's ghost?

334
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,500
Nope. Nope.

335
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,916
You are Panda, dear?

336
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:11,250
I'm so sorry. I thought you were
that ghost bitch, Pancake.

337
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,791
It's alright. Everybody makes mistakes.

338
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,666
-I'm fine.
-Panda, don't be like that.

339
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:25,500
I feel so bad about it.
I didn't know. I slapped you non-stop...

340
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:28,125
It's nothing, really.
I'm going to see a doctor later.

341
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,833
You love prying, right?

342
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,750
Phayoon! Please, don't hurt me!

343
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,916
Hey!

344
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,291
-I saw Aunt Phayoon...
-Doing what?

345
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:18,833
What did you see?

346
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,625
Nothing.

347
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:21,875
Did you see or not?

348
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,780
-I saw nothing.
-Sure?

349
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,833
Yes.

350
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:31,083
-If you see anything, tell me.
-Sure.

351
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,541
Tonmai, so what did you see?

352
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:39,458
I saw...

353
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,875
-Saw what?
-I saw Aunt Phayoon...

354
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:44,875
standing behind you.

355
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:47,708
-Whoa!
-Hey!

356
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,208
You startled me!

357
00:26:51,351 --> 00:26:52,258
So did you see?

358
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,875
No, I didn't see anything.

359
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,375
If I know...

360
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:10,583
My Lord.

361
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:13,166
Do you remember me?

362
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,791
I'm Usamanee.

363
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,458
Usamanee, who?

364
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:19,833
I don't know you.

365
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:24,291
I was the one you once adored.

366
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,125
Remember?

367
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,333
Usamanee, the woman you loved.

368
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:34,958
Who the heck?

369
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:40,166
Ouch! Please stop going around.

370
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,166
My knees hurt.

371
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,833
You don't have to be afraid, My Lord.

372
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,458
I'm still your Usamanee.

373
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:52,791
Same old face.

374
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,958
Nothing has changed.

375
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,375
Don't you want to watch me dance?

376
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,625
My Lord.

377
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,625
Ooh, goosebumps!

378
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:17,291
Voice of an angel.

379
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,708
Hey! Stop!

380
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,465
Taew, he's mine!

381
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,666
Your wife's right here.

382
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,458
Why is it so hard to get out?

383
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,625
The hole's too tight. Ugh, so stinky!

384
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:24,458
Why did I have to die here?

385
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,166
Well, well, well. Taew and Cartoon.

386
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,875
End up together now?

387
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:50,916
Taew!

388
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,291
Cartoon!

389
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:54,916
Sleepyhead as usual.

390
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,875
Cartoon!

391
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:00,291
Cartoon!

392
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,000
Hey!

393
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:05,458
Whoa!

394
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,666
Is this Panda or Pancake?

395
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,875
How dare you hit my hubby on the head?

396
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:27,000
-Who?
-Hubby.

397
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,750
-Your hubby?
-Yeah.

398
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:30,500
Damn!

399
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,583
Is he French?

400
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,041
You like fries?

401
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,500
Want a dip? You want some?

402
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,333
Yeah, yeah. I like dipping.

403
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:40,416
You can dip only me, sweetheart.

404
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,750
Hey, I missed you so much.

405
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,833
Is she dead or just sleeping?

406
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:47,833
Hey!

407
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,791
Taew...

408
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,375
Taew!

409
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,666
What the hell? Is this Panda or Pancake?

410
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,041
-Shut your word hole!
-Oh, it's Pancake.

411
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,958
You're still foul-mouthed.

412
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,458
What took you so long?

413
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,250
We've been calling you since forever.

414
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,625
Oh, come on!

415
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,833
Look at the size of the toilet hole.

416
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:11,125
-You think it's easy to get out?
-What kind of ghost haunts a toilet?

417
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,333
Well, I died there.

418
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:13,875
Sorry, I forgot.

419
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,791
I really have to thank you though

420
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:21,208
for having Khoi ordained for me.

421
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,625
They summoned a ghost.

422
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,333
Your face is still large.

423
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
-Didn't get plastic surgery yet?
-Do you hear?

424
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:30,250
-Not quite clear.
-Get a jaw reduction.

425
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,208
Then widen your eyes.

426
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:38,625
-Sis.
-Yes?

427
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:40,916
Someone's eavesdropping.

428
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,750
Ghost... Ghost...

429
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,541
Ghost... Please help.

430
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,083
Phayoon.

431
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:54,833
-What are you doing here?
-Help me!

432
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,041
-What are you talking about?
-The ghost...

433
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,125
How did you get in here?

434
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:03,125
I'm just... passing by.

435
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:06,375
-How did you end up in our room?
-Oh, no, no, no.

436
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,541
I just wanted to....

437
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,541
-Oh! I want to borrow a flashlight.
-What do you need it for?

438
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:15,541
To remove my appendix.
The lights in my room went out.

439
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:20,416
-She's probably watching us lovebirds.
-Three of us. It's a threesome.

440
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,958
Don't tell Taew about me
bringing Novice to bust those ghosts.

441
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,458
Because I want this to be my mega project.

442
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,916
Novice... please don't stop.

443
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,750
Keep chanting. What are you afraid of?

444
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,250
What are you doing?

445
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:55,416
You want to capture me in there?
Not gonna happen.

446
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:59,625
She refuses to get inside this pot.
She doesn't comply.

447
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,750
Usamanee.

448
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:05,791
There's a lot of
your favorite stuff in there.

449
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:08,333
You should check it out.

450
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,041
Do I look stupid to you?

451
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,333
No, I don't think so.

452
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:14,291
But any smart people
would definitely go see for themselves.

453
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:15,583
Right?

454
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:17,750
I'm a smart person.

455
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,208
I'll get in there.

456
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:28,166
We'd be damned without you.

457
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,000
Which way? She's coming for us!

458
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,375
-Come on, you guys.
-Over there.

459
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:16,083
Think you can hide forever?

460
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:22,791
I will survive.

461
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,708
She's here!

462
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,875
That's so nasty!

463
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,375
-Smells like shit!
-Eww, I'm gonna throw up!

464
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,875
Come on, let's share
the smell, so it fades out.

465
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,375
I can't take it anymore.

466
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,000
Let's go!

467
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:05,625
Come on!

468
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:11,333
You're helping
your little friends, aren't you?

469
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,291
Yeah, you're good.

470
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,458
But I don't get it.
How could they all fit in there?

471
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,166
All of them in that trash bin?

472
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,333
Trichada.

473
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,583
The two of us might not
belong together in this life.

474
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,208
But if there's a next life,

475
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,583
I wish for us to be together.

476
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:25,916
Hold on, shorty!

477
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:29,791
Oh, you're so statuesque! Who are you?

478
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,458
Why are you following me?

479
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,833
Get it into your thick skull.
My name's Pancake.

480
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,916
-Want to hear my motto?
-Whatever.

481
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,875
A classy slut who can slap.

482
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,583
You got nothing on me
'cause I'm the real Queen Bitch.

483
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,750
-My turn.
-Go on.

484
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:50,166
With my unrivaled beauty,
Kendall calls me Mother.

485
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,500
-Taylor doesn't dare to compare.
-Yikes!

486
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:53,958
Gigi is unmatched.

487
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:55,916
Bella doesn't want to be near.

488
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,666
Usamanee is my name.

489
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,041
I don't want to know.

490
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,000
I want to know why you're scaring people.

491
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,666
Because this building was built
on the ground where I lived,

492
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
where I died, and more importantly

493
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,791
where I fell in love.

494
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,000
By the way,

495
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,791
-how did you die?
-I was raped.

496
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:14,500
Oh, give me a break!

497
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:17,666
Didn't you smash your head
on the toilet bowl?

498
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,875
Oh, bite me!

499
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:20,833
What about you? How did you die?

500
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,625
It's a heart-wrenching story.

501
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,208
I got murdered

502
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,416
because someone
was jealous of my love life.

503
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:30,250
I'm warning you now.

504
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,958
Stop tormenting these people.

505
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,750
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

506
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,291
Especially that bitch!

507
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,583
-Who's she?
-My best friend.

508
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:41,958
What a duo!

509
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:45,166
-A beauty and a toad?
-So what?

510
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,083
Can you find a friend like mine?

511
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,708
I see you walk around by yourself.

512
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,875
-My friends are all celebs.
-Huh, never see them.

513
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,625
-You want to fight?
-Stop arguing, Usamanee...

514
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:54,750
Fatass.

515
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,208
You tell your friend.

516
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,041
If I lose my weight,

517
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,791
a face like hers
can't even compare to my toenails.

518
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:05,333
-Really?
-Bitch! Can you give me a sign first?

519
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:07,958
Both of you.

520
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,708
If you try to harm
anyone in this building,

521
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,541
I'm gonna make you pay, Varanus.

522
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,666
What?

523
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:15,833
Monitor lizard.

524
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,458
-Let's go, Varanus.
-Hmm?

525
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,000
-Usamanee.
-Right.

526
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:26,041
Listen to me.
You don't have to worry about us.

527
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:27,583
There.

528
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:31,583
You should keep
both eyes on your new tenant.

529
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,791
Toadface Uthaitaewee.

530
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:38,916
She meant herself.

531
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:49,541
Keep crying! Cry your heart out!

532
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,500
What's the matter?

533
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,416
Dad? What happened?

534
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,708
What's wrong?

535
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,875
She knows.

536
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:59,208
She found out I sent my hubby back home.

537
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,458
And she wouldn't stop crying.

538
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,541
If I didn't, what was going to happen?

539
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:05,583
Then why are you crying?

540
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:07,375
I love him!

541
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:10,291
How can you say that? He's my husband!

542
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,291
-I love him because he's yours.
-What?

543
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:15,791
-If you want to cry, cry.
-Sis!

544
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:19,583
-Pancake.
-Who woke up the jealous bitch inside you?

545
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,708
Enjoy it much? Being a homewrecker?

546
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:30,000
Khoi, thank you for
dedicating merits to me.

547
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,833
Sis, I've got some news for you.

548
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:37,208
Usamanee and Trichada
wouldn't leave us alone

549
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,083
because it was their territory.

550
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:42,833
They both died here.

551
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:45,791
And this building
was built over their graves.

552
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,708
When will your hubby come back?

553
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,333
See? I told you so.

554
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:56,250
You shouldn't have
bought this place from Areeya.

555
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,791
-But it's cheap!
-Apartments with ghosts? Worth it?

556
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,833
I love leasing.

557
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:04,583
Yeah, keep crying.

558
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:07,041
How are you gonna help us, Pancake?

559
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:09,541
Help?

560
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,375
This is love at first sight!

561
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:24,166
Sis, if you get me
a Blythe doll, I'll help.

562
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:32,000
We're going to Siam.
We must look good.

563
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:36,916
Cherman will get jealous
when she sees us.

564
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:38,666
Right.

565
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:42,083
Get Khoi to see
if our looks are spot on.

566
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,625
Khoi.

567
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:45,666
Yes.

568
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:51,416
-How do I look?
-So good!

569
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,291
You look exactly alike.

570
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,375
What about me?

571
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,458
-Like twins!
-Really?

572
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:57,458
Really.

573
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,666
-Four?
-Right here.

574
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,708
-Mod?
-Fighto!

575
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:06,458
My heart got melted away, away with you.

576
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,708
Let's go to Siam.

577
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:22,000
What is it? What's real love?

578
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,583
Those feels inside the guts...

579
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:27,291
Slay!

580
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,458
Oh!

581
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,666
Why don't you get dressed?

582
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:33,416
We'll be late for Dubai.

583
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,708
To visit Mr. Thaksin?

584
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,791
To buy a Blithe for Pancake.

585
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,500
-Oh, to buy, not Dubai.
-Yeah. But...

586
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,875
You guys are a little overdressed.

587
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,125
-You're more than overdressed.
-Oh, wait.

588
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,110
What about Areeya?

589
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:52,500
Her face doesn't go well
with the vibes of Siam.

590
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,666
We can ask her when we go to Chinatown.

591
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,375
-Let's go.
-Okay.

592
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:16,333
This is it. The shop I was talking about.

593
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:17,750
Reasonable price.

594
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:40,916
Sis... Sis...

595
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:42,791
Please go brush your teeth.

596
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:47,041
-Sis.
-What?

597
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,333
Pancake?

598
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,875
Khoi, sleep.

599
00:42:52,277 --> 00:42:54,958
I heard you went to Siam today.

600
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,166
Did you forget something?

601
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:02,125
-Forgot what?
-D... d... d...

602
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,833
-Duck?
-Nope. Not a duck.

603
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,083
-My doll!
-We didn't forget.

604
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:10,958
We went there just to buy it for you.

605
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:16,208
-Close your eyes.
-It's a surprise?

606
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,791
-Here you go!
-What?

607
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,541
What kind of goddamn doll is that?

608
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,958
Not a goddamn doll. Just a regular doll.

609
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,625
-You want it or not?
-Yeah.

610
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:32,000
Get the job done,
I'll buy you a real Blythe.

611
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:34,250
I know you're lying.

612
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,791
But I'll help you.

613
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,166
-She looks like me?
-Uncanny!

614
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,250
I'm gonna name her...

615
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:43,666
-E-Taew.
-That's my name!

616
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,666
-My doll's name!
-Oh.

617
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,958
-E-Taew, you lying bitch!
-What?

618
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:51,041
-You called me a lying bitch?
-I meant my doll.

619
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,125
Alright.

620
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,416
-You snake.
-You called me a snake?

621
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:58,166
-I'm talking to my doll.
-Alright.

622
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:01,041
-Use your ears, neanderthal.
-You're talking to your doll.

623
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:02,625
-No. I mean you.
-Hey!

624
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,458
-I have to go.
-Okay.

625
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:05,500
You old hag.

626
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:07,416
-You're talking to your doll.
-No. You.

627
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,791
Feels like it's mostly me.

628
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:18,291
Holy shit! Khoi, did you just take a dump?

629
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:22,333
What kind of grown-ass
adult poops in the bed?

630
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:25,666
Stop right there!

631
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,000
Pancake!

632
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,416
What's the rush?

633
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,625
-You look better.
-Thank you.

634
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:44,041
Don't tell me
you've been taking hormones.

635
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:49,666
Oh, not really. I look the same.

636
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:53,791
Do you have anything else?

637
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,291
Because I have to go to school.

638
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:57,666
Liar!

639
00:44:57,791 --> 00:45:00,041
-You're just back from school.
-Oops!

640
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:01,708
I forgot.

641
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:04,750
What kind of a hexed doll did you buy?

642
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:08,625
I want the one with changeable
eye colors when you pull the cord.

643
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,750
This one's technically the same.

644
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,083
Are you serious?

645
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:15,125
If you don't believe me, I'll show you.

646
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,625
Look.

647
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:23,958
Whoa!

648
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,125
Give it to me.

649
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:35,208
Does it change?

650
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,541
No, it doesn't.

651
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:42,041
-It's not like that.
-Liar!

652
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,875
You think I'm your friend?

653
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,875
It hurts.

654
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:07,583
-Do you smell something?
-Yeah. Like something rotten.

655
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:12,541
It's coming from this room.

656
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:14,708
Open it.

657
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:20,583
Areeya!

658
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:25,625
Who killed you?
Please come tell Cherman in a dream.

659
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,375
Then Cherman can tell me later.

660
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:32,250
-Why not in your own dream?
-I'm scared.

661
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:36,791
Khoi.

662
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,375
We don't have anyone left.

663
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:41,625
Hey! What about me?

664
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:44,208
You'll be dead soon.

665
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:52,125
Areeya, take Taew
with you to the afterlife.

666
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:56,208
You wan to get your ass
kicked at the funeral?

667
00:46:57,291 --> 00:47:01,179
Areeya, why did you have to die,
you numbnuts?

668
00:47:01,364 --> 00:47:03,164
MR. AREEYA TOKSAKED

669
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,208
Babe.

670
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,250
Today's a good day.

671
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,125
I want to introduce you
to my elder friends.

672
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:16,791
Sure! Let's go.

673
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:36,833
Sis, I want to introduce my boyfriend.

674
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,958
His name's Bin Laden.

675
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,166
Perfect timing.

676
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,750
Touch me,
we'll be together in the next life.

677
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,250
Where is Cartoon?

678
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:01,333
-Ma'am... I...
-Tonmai!

679
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:03,208
You didn't see anything?

680
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:05,166
No. Nothing.

681
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:06,416
Good boy.

682
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,291
Why? What did you see?

683
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:12,916
Phayoon.

684
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:14,166
Just arrived?

685
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:16,333
Sorry I'm late.
I was getting my hair done.

686
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,291
Please take a seat.

687
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,458
Do you know

688
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:29,208
who killed Areeya?

689
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:31,041
-Huh!
-Who?

690
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,666
-Phayoon...
-What!

691
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:33,708
...didn't do it.

692
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,458
Goddamn dramatic pause.

693
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,916
But I can tell you who did.

694
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,250
Who's the killer?

695
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,000
Usamanee!

696
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:54,541
I didn't kill her!

697
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,291
Don't put it on me.

698
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:03,333
-Phayoon!
-Help her!

699
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:04,458
Phayoon!

700
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,916
Phayoon? Are you alright?

701
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:08,500
Is she conscious?

702
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:10,083
Pull her out!

703
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:11,250
Sis!

704
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:12,833
What the hell happened?

705
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:14,458
I've got some good news.

706
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:16,416
I found a ghostbuster!

707
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:17,666
For real?

708
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,666
She studied World Law
at an international institute

709
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,916
in Switzerland.

710
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,250
But enjoys busting ghosts.

711
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:27,875
-Are you sure?
-Yes, of course.

712
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:29,333
You think you can defeat me?

713
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:30,726
Not gonna happen!

714
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,041
Oh!

715
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:36,750
Really?

716
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:38,541
Smiling at your own funeral?

717
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:23,416
Lady Shaman.

718
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,541
It's over here.

719
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:29,041
Come forth!

720
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,416
Stay close to me.

721
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:32,166
Stick together.

722
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:35,958
She's not scared.

723
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,416
Just asking for a friend.

724
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:39,742
Reveal yourself!

725
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,708
Reveal yourself now!

726
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,125
Are you alright?

727
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,666
Lady Shaman's gonna get you!

728
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:55,583
Why do you want to mess with me?

729
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,250
I told you. I didn't kill.

730
00:50:58,416 --> 00:51:00,041
Look at our shaman!

731
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,125
You're crazy!

732
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:04,625
Evil spirit!

733
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,583
Reveal yourself and I will vanquish you!

734
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:07,541
-Ooh.
-Ahh.

735
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
What was that?

736
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:09,958
You crazy old hag!

737
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:12,833
How dare you call me crazy old hag?

738
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:17,291
You committed an offense
under section 326 of the Penal Code

739
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:20,000
by imputing me before a third party.

740
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:23,333
You shall be imprisoned for one year
and/or fined 100,000 Baht.

741
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:25,541
-Hot damn!
-She's the real deal!

742
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:26,625
I'll sue you.

743
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,541
You'll be served
with a writ, you evil spirit.

744
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:31,458
Are you really suing a ghost?

745
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:32,750
Yes.

746
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:33,791
It's coming for you!

747
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:35,791
But if you vote for me, number four,

748
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:38,000
I'll make sure
you're cleared on all charges.

749
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:39,708
I'll vote for you.

750
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,833
-Good. I'm leaving.
-Hold on.

751
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:44,333
When can I vote?

752
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,250
-When Parliament is dissolved.
-Okay.

753
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:49,041
-Thanks. Bye.
-Wait!

754
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,416
Governor or representative?

755
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,250
Whatever comes first,
I'll go with that one.

756
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:55,000
-Okay.
-Thanks again. Bye.

757
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:58,750
She got one vote and she quit.

758
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:00,666
-She just left us here.
-It's your turn.

759
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,458
What? Why don't you
go vote for her?

760
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,291
You really believe that?

761
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,166
A weird candidate
who wears eight-inch heels.

762
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,500
-I thought she was a giraffe.
-You liar!

763
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:11,708
A real filthy spirit!

764
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:14,750
Nobody's going to get any sleep tonight.

765
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,833
-What are you doing?
-I'm gonna punish you all.

766
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:31,166
Where are you going, Southern fag?

767
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:43,541
Whoa! Isn't she something?

768
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,958
Boo-hoo! Nitwit!

769
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:51,666
You wicked ghost!

770
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:55,166
How can you do that
to a sweet girl like me?

771
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,125
I'm not scared!

772
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:00,500
You underestimate how feisty I can be!

773
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:01,958
You want to fight with me?

774
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:05,458
Do you see? Come on!

775
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,166
I'm not just a regular Southern girl.

776
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,125
Look!

777
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:11,083
Graceful and lissome Southern moves.

778
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,750
Do you know what this is called?

779
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:15,458
Mor lam band.

780
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,583
Band? What band?
It's just me dancing.

781
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,083
This is called Nora, you idiot!

782
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:23,666
Come on! Dance off, me and you!

783
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:28,666
Can you nail this move?

784
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,958
Watch me!

785
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,708
You'd better watch!

786
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,500
She can do that?

787
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:43,208
Anything else?

788
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:54,875
Whoa! How can she do that?

789
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,791
See? I told you so!

790
00:53:57,916 --> 00:54:00,125
Nora moves are the next level!

791
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:01,541
Can you do it?

792
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:03,583
You're so flexible.

793
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:05,916
Come on! Bring it!

794
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:07,833
Just bend your back all the way?

795
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:08,958
Yeah.

796
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,458
Do it! Come on! You should try!

797
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,875
Ouch! my back.

798
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:29,958
How's that?

799
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:31,958
You can't do it, can you?

800
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:34,791
Watch me!

801
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:43,625
You see?

802
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,125
Speechless, huh?

803
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:48,500
Can you do what I do?

804
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:49,875
Take it!

805
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:52,916
Then catch me if you can!

806
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,208
Where are you taking my leg?

807
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,000
Are you crazy?
How can I run with one leg?

808
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,250
Stop!

809
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,166
Is she following?

810
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:05,458
Dad, what now?

811
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,708
I have a plan.

812
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:12,208
Ugh, I hate this!

813
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:14,500
Shouldn't have thrown my leg at her.

814
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,222
Why did I make my life harder?

815
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:18,625
I've had enough of this!

816
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:31,041
Dad? Which room are you in?

817
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:34,291
The second one.

818
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,875
Boo!

819
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:40,541
How can they deceive a ghost?

820
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:48,250
Dad? Which room again?

821
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:51,833
The first one.

822
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:55,250
Think I'm an idiot?

823
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:02,541
Deceived me over and over again.

824
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,500
Dad? Which room?

825
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,708
The third one.

826
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:29,458
My Lord.

827
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:32,458
Don't treat me like this.

828
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:34,916
It hurts.

829
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:38,000
Is she coming after me?

830
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:39,458
So scary!

831
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,583
What? Are you just
gonna scare everyone?

832
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:45,541
I'm a ghost!

833
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:46,625
What are you gonna do?

834
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:48,208
I'm strangling you.

835
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,625
Strangling me?

836
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:52,958
You can't even reach my neck, you runt!

837
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,291
Then I... I squeeze your tummy!

838
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,833
What if I vomit to death,
who will cook for you?

839
00:57:01,581 --> 00:57:04,041
I don't want to eat your food.
You just throw everything in.

840
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,833
"Just eat it or throw it away,"
You frying-pan face!

841
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,375
How dare you call me
frying-pan face, potty mouth!

842
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:12,416
You look as though
you have a giant pan for your face.

843
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,583
What else can I call you?

844
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:17,000
You're making fun of me?
You're making fun of me?

845
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:29,000
Wow! You're smart!

846
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:32,166
A ghost can be electrocuted.
Goodbye and go to hell.

847
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:39,125
Help me! I'm being fried!

848
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:41,208
-Please help!
-Sure.

849
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,708
Here's my help!

850
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,291
Screw you, you frying-pan face!

851
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,250
You mega giant face!

852
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,583
Ugly fat face!

853
00:57:49,416 --> 00:57:50,333
Ogre!

854
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:53,708
So scared!

855
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:57,041
Is she still following me?

856
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:03,333
-What the hell is that?
-Filthy foot.

857
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:04,541
Why are you dissing me?

858
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:06,833
No, I didn't.

859
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:09,250
-It's her actual foot.
-Oh.

860
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:13,708
Is she still following?

861
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:18,166
You're sticking your foot at me?

862
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,958
-I'm not. It's not my foot.
-Then whose foot?

863
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:22,708
Usamanee's.

864
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:23,666
Oh.

865
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:28,333
Don't you worry.

866
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,833
She can't follow us. I have her foot.

867
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:31,833
I'm not worried.

868
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:34,500
But that chair is moving!
It's moving! I'm out of here!

869
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:47,166
Still scared of me?
I've been with you for ages.

870
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:48,250
I'm upset.

871
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:50,791
I don't get it. What's so scary about me?

872
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,250
Pancake.

873
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,083
Of course it's me!

874
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:01,166
While you're busy running around
with the shaman and that ghost,

875
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,625
don't you know
someone sneaked into your room?

876
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,583
Who sneaked in?

877
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:08,625
-Phayoon.
-What?

878
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:10,708
-She looked for Khoi's shirt.
-What?

879
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:13,250
-And took a button.
-What?

880
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:15,500
Stop with the whats. That's it.

881
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:20,625
What was she looking for, Khoi?

882
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:21,875
Huh?

883
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:23,625
We "what?" You "huh?"

884
00:59:25,416 --> 00:59:26,625
What was she looking for?

885
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,875
Almost got caught.

886
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:47,583
Do you want to know
what's inside Phayoon's room?

887
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:49,375
I'm curious too.

888
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:58,125
How can you eat that? It's human food.

889
00:59:58,416 --> 01:00:01,083
You have to wait for the offerings.

890
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:04,416
I can't pick much.

891
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:06,458
"Just eat it or throw it away."

892
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:11,458
Believe me.

893
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,916
You have to keep her out of the room.

894
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:16,333
So I can take a look inside.

895
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,666
I can't go in if she's still there.

896
01:00:18,914 --> 01:00:20,583
-Why?
-It's etiquette.

897
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:23,750
Oh, you snob!

898
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,458
She's here.

899
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:32,958
Hi, Phayoon.

900
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:34,958
You sent Phookan to bring me here.

901
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:38,000
-Yes.
-What's the matter?

902
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:39,916
If it's nothing then excuse me.

903
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:41,708
Hold on. Wait a second.

904
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:44,250
Have a seat. Let's talk.

905
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:48,083
-Please.
-What is this all about? I think...

906
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:51,250
-I should go.
-Wait, Phayoon.

907
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,481
We have something to discuss...

908
01:00:53,581 --> 01:00:55,416
What do we want to talk to her about?

909
01:00:55,541 --> 01:00:58,000
You can't go back right now.

910
01:00:58,125 --> 01:00:59,416
You'll see...

911
01:01:00,583 --> 01:01:01,500
See what?

912
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:02,666
Nothing.

913
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:03,791
My Lord.

914
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:05,291
Yes, your lord.

915
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,000
-You can greet him.
-Hello, My Lord.

916
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,333
She practices black magic.

917
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:19,500
She has a voodoo child.

918
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:21,791
-Midget!
-Oops!

919
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:26,750
What are you doing
in my master's room?

920
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,375
Look at you! Strut like a man!

921
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:34,750
Phew! Poi.

922
01:01:34,916 --> 01:01:36,000
Did you forget?

923
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:38,416
When you were alive, you were a twink.

924
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,041
Of course I remember.

925
01:01:40,916 --> 01:01:43,750
I was a twink. But life was so hard.

926
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:46,333
I'm happier with my life now as a buffalo.

927
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:48,208
My stomach is full of men.

928
01:01:49,208 --> 01:01:51,041
Your stomach is full of men?

929
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,458
A buffalo's supposed
to chew on grass, not men.

930
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:54,750
I'll chew your head off!

931
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:58,500
-If you don't leave now.
-No. What are you doing about it?

932
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:00,000
I'll make you pay for it!

933
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,500
You think I can't fight? Think again.

934
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:05,458
-Come on!
-Come on.

935
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:10,708
Buffoon!

936
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:16,166
Thank you so much. That's all for tonight.

937
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:17,958
-I should go.
-Goodnight.

938
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:20,708
-Sweet dreams.
-Probably done by now.

939
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,750
What a relief!

940
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,541
It's about time.

941
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,416
-Can't stall any longer...
-Well, I...

942
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:32,166
-If there's anything, you can come over.
-It's nothing now.

943
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,208
-Or call me on the phone.
-Please.

944
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:38,500
Scared me witless.

945
01:02:40,916 --> 01:02:42,291
Don't be dramatic.

946
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:44,500
Scared every time I come and go.

947
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,875
Oh, hey.

948
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:49,708
I saw a lot of
black magic stuff in her room.

949
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,916
All kinds of voodoo on the altars.

950
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:53,833
Voodoo children and talismans.

951
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,291
A scary black-magic buffalo.

952
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,791
There's a black-magic buffalo?

953
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,500
-Yes.
-What does it sound like?

954
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:00,791
It looks like this.

955
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,500
Oh, it's probably hungry.

956
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:11,833
If you don't believe me,
you should see for yourself.

957
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:13,833
I think Phayoon is using black magic.

958
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:20,875
Love me. Love me. Love me. Adore me.
Love me. Adore Me. Love me. Adore me.

959
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:25,208
Love me. Adore Me.
Love me. Adore me.

960
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:33,208
Love! Love! Love me!
Adore me! Adore me!

961
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:47,625
Love me... Adore me....

962
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:57,250
Hey! It's time to rise and shine.

963
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,166
Look at her. Still sleeping like a log.

964
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:01,208
What book?

965
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,416
Ooh! Beauty Bible.

966
01:04:04,791 --> 01:04:07,041
-Wow!
-Yoga poses.

967
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:08,958
Sis!

968
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:16,708
Where is Khoi anyway?

969
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:20,416
-Still intact.
-Not that.

970
01:04:21,416 --> 01:04:22,875
I mean where is Khoi?

971
01:04:24,041 --> 01:04:26,000
Wait? Where is he?

972
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:28,083
Last night he was sleeping next to me.

973
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:30,458
Where is he?

974
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:31,500
Khoi?

975
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:33,375
Where are you, Khoi?

976
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,291
Or...

977
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:36,291
Or what?

978
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:49,708
-I can't let you in.
-Why can't we go in?

979
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:52,333
Oh, no. It's not me.

980
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:54,708
I don't know. I didn't do anything.

981
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,458
But you were snuggling with him!

982
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:57,666
I didn't do anything!

983
01:04:57,833 --> 01:05:00,541
-I swear. I didn't do it.
-How can you say you didn't do it?

984
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,000
I did nothing.

985
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:03,833
Khoi sneaked into my bed.

986
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:05,916
He said I was beautiful.

987
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:08,708
You're beautiful? Who are you kidding?

988
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:10,541
You are a horrible person!

989
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:13,208
Ouch! Sis!

990
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,416
Khoi, why did you kick your mom?

991
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,375
-Help me!
-Why did you do that?

992
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,166
Help me, please!

993
01:05:24,666 --> 01:05:25,541
Get out!

994
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,875
Khoi!

995
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,625
Help me!

996
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,708
He's head over heels after just a night.

997
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:35,166
Go!

998
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:39,916
Khoi is out of his mind.

999
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:43,291
Sis!

1000
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:45,000
Didn't I tell you?

1001
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,916
Knock the door
before you let them in.

1002
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:48,208
I tried.

1003
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:52,791
Hey, are you alright?

1004
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,583
She got kicked by her own son.

1005
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,166
Khoi kicked you?

1006
01:05:57,666 --> 01:05:59,083
He beat me up.

1007
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:02,500
I have to go to school now.

1008
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:04,416
-Bye.
-Hey!

1009
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,666
You brought
a guy home last night?

1010
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:08,041
No, it's not like that.

1011
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:09,875
You got me wrong. It's just...

1012
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,791
He came here to pick me up
for school. I don't know the way.

1013
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:16,083
Mother got kicked by her own son.

1014
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,583
Hurry up! Before you get kicked too.

1015
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:19,833
Are you okay?

1016
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,083
-Stop it, old hag!
-You scared me!

1017
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:27,500
Phayoon, I know you use
black magic to ensnare him.

1018
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:28,833
That's not true.

1019
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:30,958
Khoi loves me for my beauty.

1020
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,125
Yikes!

1021
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,958
Which mirror shows you're beautiful?

1022
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:35,083
All of them.

1023
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,125
Khoi!

1024
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:38,500
If there were
two women left on this earth,

1025
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:40,750
This hag and me, who would you choose?

1026
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:42,791
Phayoon.

1027
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,458
-You hear that?
-Low standards!

1028
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,166
Khoi, it's okay.

1029
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:50,958
-Phayoon!
-What?

1030
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,083
-Where are all those altars and talismans?
-I don't have them.

1031
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:57,375
-Never had them.
-Liar!

1032
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:59,875
-There are no such things in here.
-Bullshit! Where are they?

1033
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,041
I don't know!

1034
01:07:02,166 --> 01:07:03,375
Where did you hide them?

1035
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:06,833
Tell me where you hid them.

1036
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:09,833
How about that? Grab her!

1037
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:12,416
Khoi, let me go!

1038
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:13,875
I'll demolish your spirit!

1039
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:15,333
Demolish?

1040
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,958
Can you get it out already?
My face is all beaten up!

1041
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:29,083
Hold still.

1042
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:32,916
It's burning!

1043
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,583
It's burning!

1044
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:38,333
Are you alright?

1045
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:43,666
Thank you so much, Usamanee and Trichada.

1046
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:46,416
You're welcome. But hey,

1047
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:48,166
I think we should catch our breath.

1048
01:07:49,083 --> 01:07:49,958
Good.

1049
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,708
So what's your story,
Usamanee and Trichada?

1050
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,375
I'll tell you now.

1051
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:03,125
Trichada and I,

1052
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:06,541
we were the most
beautiful actresses back then.

1053
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:10,125
Trichada I believe. But you?

1054
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:12,333
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

1055
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:13,791
One of the best.

1056
01:08:23,457 --> 01:08:25,750
So, who is Phayoon?

1057
01:08:26,457 --> 01:08:28,417
Why does she
have to put a spell on Khoi?

1058
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:31,042
Lady Phayoon and Trichada

1059
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:32,917
were both the lord's wives.

1060
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,082
He was reborn as Khoi.

1061
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:36,375
Where are you going?

1062
01:08:37,082 --> 01:08:39,667
I want to spend the night with Trichada.

1063
01:08:41,707 --> 01:08:42,582
My Lord!

1064
01:08:45,832 --> 01:08:48,417
Trichada... You slut.

1065
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:57,375
He's also very fond of me.

1066
01:08:57,875 --> 01:08:58,750
Really?

1067
01:09:00,457 --> 01:09:03,167
Until one night, the lord...

1068
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:05,792
sneaked into my room.

1069
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,125
I didn't know what to do.

1070
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:10,167
Usamanee.

1071
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:13,667
My Lord.

1072
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:15,417
Please don't do it.

1073
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,417
We shouldn't do what's inappropriate.

1074
01:09:18,582 --> 01:09:19,667
I think...

1075
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:23,167
if Lady Phayoon finds out,
she's not going like it.

1076
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:26,082
Please don't do it!

1077
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,917
Oh, no. Please stop! My Lord!

1078
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,332
My Lord, stop it!

1079
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:36,457
My Lord! Your hands...

1080
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:40,417
That night I became
one of his wives against my will.

1081
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,832
Oh, my nape! It's ticklish! Please stop!

1082
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:44,582
How could he?

1083
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:47,832
Why did he treat me like that?

1084
01:09:48,292 --> 01:09:50,042
Like I was an easy woman.

1085
01:09:51,542 --> 01:09:53,207
I wasn't even prepared.

1086
01:09:54,582 --> 01:09:56,042
I'm not ready.

1087
01:09:58,167 --> 01:10:00,582
Really? Smells like bullshit.

1088
01:10:01,292 --> 01:10:02,500
I find it hard to believe.

1089
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:03,957
It's true, Pancake.

1090
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:05,957
For real?

1091
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:06,917
I didn't ask you.

1092
01:10:07,917 --> 01:10:08,792
Shut up.

1093
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:12,792
Do you know that
I'm moving to the main house?

1094
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:17,707
He's so enamored by me.

1095
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:21,375
I feel uncomfortable.

1096
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,500
My room is next to yours.

1097
01:10:32,957 --> 01:10:33,832
Phayoon's coming.

1098
01:10:34,207 --> 01:10:36,292
Oh, careful, My Lord.

1099
01:10:39,332 --> 01:10:41,582
It's beautiful up here.

1100
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:07,582
The solar eclipse will occur tomorrow.

1101
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:13,457
It's time I sent Usamanee and Trichada

1102
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:18,082
to the deepest circle of hell
never to be born again!

1103
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:21,250
Poi.

1104
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:26,582
Watch out and don't let
anyone come near my ritual.

1105
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:30,000
My Lord,

1106
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:32,207
we'll be together...

1107
01:11:33,417 --> 01:11:34,500
forever.

1108
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,167
Repeat after me.

1109
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,875
We'll be together forever.

1110
01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:39,292
Again.

1111
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,457
-We'll be together forever.
-Again.

1112
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:44,042
We'll be together forever.

1113
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:45,917
He gave me double.

1114
01:11:46,957 --> 01:11:48,792
We'll be together forever.

1115
01:11:49,082 --> 01:11:50,625
We'll be together forever.

1116
01:11:50,707 --> 01:11:52,457
We'll be together forever.

1117
01:11:56,707 --> 01:11:57,957
It was her plan all along.

1118
01:11:59,707 --> 01:12:01,667
What should we do now, Usamanee?

1119
01:12:03,292 --> 01:12:05,375
Don't you worry.

1120
01:12:06,207 --> 01:12:08,625
You helped me
so I'll gladly return the favor.

1121
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:11,917
And for revenge? They sure have it coming!

1122
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:14,167
Let me help you.

1123
01:12:15,667 --> 01:12:17,417
I'm gonna get you, Phayoon.

1124
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:21,207
You guys... listen carefully!

1125
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:25,167
There will be a solar eclipse tomorrow.

1126
01:12:25,707 --> 01:12:27,207
Best place to view ?

1127
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:29,318
China. Oh, come on!

1128
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:30,274
Sis!

1129
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:31,875
-Are you listening?
-Yes.

1130
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:36,542
Phayoon will curse Usamanee and Trichada

1131
01:12:36,707 --> 01:12:38,457
so they will never be born again.

1132
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,500
If we fail to stop the ritual,

1133
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:44,792
they will be ensnared in hell forever.

1134
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:46,207
Really?

1135
01:12:46,667 --> 01:12:47,750
Yes.

1136
01:12:47,957 --> 01:12:49,000
And more importantly,

1137
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,917
we have to help Khoi.

1138
01:12:52,457 --> 01:12:54,125
He's still one of us.

1139
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,582
Khoi, my son.

1140
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,792
We really have to use our magic again?

1141
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,292
But it's necessary.

1142
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:05,542
Right. We have to help them.

1143
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:22,667
The altar is over there.

1144
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:26,207
We have to destroy it
before the total eclipse happens.

1145
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:27,250
Let's do it!

1146
01:13:27,332 --> 01:13:28,250
Stop!

1147
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,375
Phayoon.

1148
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:38,792
You came up here to ruin my ritual?

1149
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:40,250
No way!

1150
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:42,167
Khoi, come to Mama!

1151
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,582
Khoi, come to your aunt.

1152
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:48,707
You said she was a good person.

1153
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:51,332
You're right. A good person
wouldn't dress up like that!

1154
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:52,750
Phayoon.

1155
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:54,417
Let me ask you something.

1156
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:56,167
Why would you do that?

1157
01:13:56,417 --> 01:13:57,917
You're not me. You don't understand.

1158
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,707
Usamanee and Trichada,

1159
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:01,750
they were the sources of my suffering.

1160
01:14:01,832 --> 01:14:02,707
Not true.

1161
01:14:03,042 --> 01:14:03,917
Hey!

1162
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:07,250
You were the one
who put us through suffering.

1163
01:14:07,457 --> 01:14:08,332
Not true!

1164
01:14:08,957 --> 01:14:12,207
Both of you tormented me.

1165
01:14:12,832 --> 01:14:14,064
If you don't believe it,

1166
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:15,875
I'll tell you right now.

1167
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:18,832
It's so dirty here!

1168
01:14:18,957 --> 01:14:21,332
-But I just cleaned it.
-Do it again.

1169
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:24,042
Ouch!

1170
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:26,042
Do as we say and stop complaining.

1171
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,125
Keep blowing!

1172
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:29,707
The smoke got in my eyes!

1173
01:14:30,082 --> 01:14:32,082
-Why don't you move over there?
-Shut up!

1174
01:14:32,292 --> 01:14:34,375
You have problems? What's your problem?

1175
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:38,167
-Between each toe.
-Right on.

1176
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:41,542
Why did you soak it again?

1177
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,000
I just dried your foot.

1178
01:14:43,957 --> 01:14:45,042
I dried, you soaked.

1179
01:14:45,832 --> 01:14:47,042
Why did you soak it again?

1180
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:48,667
-Different side.
-Right, different side.

1181
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,707
Oh, no! It hurts so bad!

1182
01:15:02,082 --> 01:15:03,292
It hurts so bad!

1183
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:08,500
You two were real devils.

1184
01:15:08,582 --> 01:15:09,457
Liars!

1185
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,082
Gullible fools!

1186
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,082
You believe those lies?

1187
01:15:13,332 --> 01:15:14,207
Yes.

1188
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:16,207
I'll tell you the truth about how we died

1189
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:17,832
and who killed us.

1190
01:15:19,417 --> 01:15:21,000
-Bitches.
-Eternal liars.

1191
01:15:21,582 --> 01:15:24,417
Scrub it here! Here! Here!

1192
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,582
Don't you listen?

1193
01:15:25,832 --> 01:15:27,957
What about there? And there!

1194
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:31,042
When are you waiting for?
Add more fire! Fire!

1195
01:15:31,875 --> 01:15:33,707
Fire not firewood! Fire!

1196
01:15:33,917 --> 01:15:36,375
Coconut! I told you to boil it!

1197
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:38,875
Put it in! Quickly!

1198
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,542
-You want the whole coconut?
-Vegetables! Get them in.

1199
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:46,000
Come on. Work faster.
Add vegetables and peppers.

1200
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,957
Can you go any faster? Come on!

1201
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,917
Faster! Faster!

1202
01:15:53,604 --> 01:15:54,750
So ticklish!

1203
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:57,417
Enough! I'm tickled.

1204
01:16:00,207 --> 01:16:01,250
-My Lady.
-What?

1205
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:03,457
-My hair is dripping.
-You're playing around?

1206
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:06,292
You're playing around
and getting your hair wet?

1207
01:16:07,667 --> 01:16:08,542
Don't do that ever again!

1208
01:16:12,542 --> 01:16:13,417
My Lady, you're cruel!

1209
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:15,042
My name is Phayoon, not Cruel.

1210
01:16:15,207 --> 01:16:16,082
Lady Phayoon.

1211
01:16:16,207 --> 01:16:19,582
I told you many times
not to climb around here.

1212
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:22,417
You understand? Huh? Understand?

1213
01:16:28,457 --> 01:16:32,585
You're the worst of the worst.
Your blue eye shadow and butthole lips!

1214
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,666
Go bother your master.

1215
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:39,082
I feel so bad for you.

1216
01:16:40,832 --> 01:16:43,042
-Poor things.
-Don't trust them. They're liars.

1217
01:16:43,417 --> 01:16:45,707
-You shut up!
-Why would I? You shut up!

1218
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,625
-You're a liar!
-You're liars!

1219
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,042
-You evil liar!
-Enough!

1220
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:51,500
Enough! Both of you!

1221
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:55,042
You keep digging up the past.

1222
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,917
Usamanee, tell us, how can we help you?

1223
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,332
If I knew, I wouldn't ask you for help.

1224
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:01,292
Aww!

1225
01:17:03,042 --> 01:17:06,582
She confined our spirits to the past.

1226
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:11,375
Well, since it all went down in the past,

1227
01:17:11,917 --> 01:17:13,292
we should go back to fix it.

1228
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:16,082
Time-traveling
is as easy as going to the mall?

1229
01:17:16,417 --> 01:17:18,582
I can take you back in time.
It's actually easier.

1230
01:17:18,832 --> 01:17:19,707
How?

1231
01:17:19,792 --> 01:17:21,125
-Don't forget I'm a ghost.
-Right.

1232
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,125
-Dimwit!
-You idiot!

1233
01:17:23,417 --> 01:17:24,542
Ahh! Stop!

1234
01:17:25,082 --> 01:17:28,332
If you want to go then stop arguing,
before it's too late.

1235
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:29,417
-Are we going?
-Yes.

1236
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:30,792
But I'm not.

1237
01:17:31,082 --> 01:17:33,250
Suit yourself. Let's go!

1238
01:17:35,832 --> 01:17:37,832
You get out of here right now.

1239
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:39,500
-Go!
-Go!

1240
01:17:39,707 --> 01:17:40,582
What should we do?

1241
01:17:40,707 --> 01:17:42,792
Let's back off for now.
But no matter what, we fight.

1242
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,250
What should you do? Back off?

1243
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,500
I'm gonna get all of you.

1244
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:51,917
Come at me!

1245
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:55,332
-Om... Latte!
-There!

1246
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:58,875
Can you help?

1247
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:13,542
Usamanee.

1248
01:18:16,707 --> 01:18:17,582
Trichada.

1249
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:22,500
-That's Phayoon!
-Khoi!

1250
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:25,582
What Khoi? That's the lord!

1251
01:18:39,542 --> 01:18:41,625
Sis, what do we do now?

1252
01:18:43,582 --> 01:18:45,957
We should leave.
Our outfits don't match with theirs.

1253
01:18:46,417 --> 01:18:47,292
What?

1254
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:48,667
Our outfits don't match.

1255
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,250
We dress differently.

1256
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:51,707
Sorry, I didn't get it.

1257
01:18:52,332 --> 01:18:54,452
I'll take care of the outfits.

1258
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:56,875
Now hide in there one by one. You first.

1259
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:32,957
My Lord, please wait
for me in our chamber.

1260
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:19,750
Who the hell are you?

1261
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:21,875
I'm Yen.

1262
01:20:22,042 --> 01:20:23,625
What are you doing in here?

1263
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:25,707
We came to scrub the floor.

1264
01:20:26,082 --> 01:20:28,707
Get out of here as soon as you finish.

1265
01:20:29,042 --> 01:20:30,332
Yes, Ma'am.

1266
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:33,750
Unfamiliar voices.

1267
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,042
Close the door behind me.

1268
01:20:41,582 --> 01:20:44,667
Follow me. She can't recognize us.

1269
01:20:48,207 --> 01:20:49,417
-Phookan!
-Yes, Auntie.

1270
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:51,332
Go get that charmed doll.

1271
01:20:52,832 --> 01:20:55,125
Stop, Phookan! I'm your aunt!

1272
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:56,707
I'm your auntie!

1273
01:20:56,957 --> 01:20:57,832
I'm your aunt!

1274
01:20:57,917 --> 01:20:58,792
I'm your auntie!

1275
01:20:59,332 --> 01:21:00,500
Get them, My Lord.

1276
01:21:04,542 --> 01:21:05,875
Phookan! Don't do it!

1277
01:21:06,332 --> 01:21:07,375
Untie them right now.

1278
01:21:08,457 --> 01:21:09,667
Phookan!

1279
01:21:10,082 --> 01:21:11,125
Don't do it!

1280
01:21:16,875 --> 01:21:18,667
My Lord, please come over here.

1281
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:23,042
My Lord!

1282
01:21:23,582 --> 01:21:26,417
They've been gone for a while.

1283
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:30,707
I'm worried about them.
Can you send me back?

1284
01:21:30,917 --> 01:21:31,792
Yes.

1285
01:21:32,707 --> 01:21:33,582
How?

1286
01:21:33,667 --> 01:21:34,542
Turn around.

1287
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:37,292
I don't like it from behind. It hurts!

1288
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:38,500
Just a second.

1289
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,875
You love each other much, huh?
You love each other to death? Alright!

1290
01:22:18,707 --> 01:22:19,832
She's being killed...

1291
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,250
I want to help her!

1292
01:22:21,457 --> 01:22:23,832
How can you get in there?
There are bars on the window.

1293
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:25,792
We can't help her.

1294
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:27,582
We can't change the past.

1295
01:22:28,042 --> 01:22:29,457
But we can modify it.

1296
01:22:33,917 --> 01:22:35,640
-Sis!
-Ahh!

1297
01:22:36,332 --> 01:22:38,750
-How did you get here?
-Same way as you.

1298
01:22:41,082 --> 01:22:44,125
She's killing Trichada!

1299
01:22:45,957 --> 01:22:47,875
We can't change the past.

1300
01:22:48,292 --> 01:22:49,457
But we can modify it.

1301
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:04,000
Trichada!

1302
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,207
-Lady Phayoon.
-Usamanee.

1303
01:23:06,707 --> 01:23:08,667
-Are you spying on me?
-I'm not spying.

1304
01:23:08,792 --> 01:23:10,207
-Did you see anything?
-Nothing.

1305
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:11,474
Really?

1306
01:23:14,917 --> 01:23:15,792
Usamanee!

1307
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:20,207
-What did you see?
-You're so cruel!

1308
01:23:20,457 --> 01:23:21,750
Always prying in my affairs.

1309
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:23,500
Tell me, what did you see?

1310
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:24,875
Did you see anything?

1311
01:23:29,792 --> 01:23:31,042
Usamanee is dead!

1312
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:36,875
Died at my foot bowl.

1313
01:23:40,167 --> 01:23:43,292
She told me she was killed
because of her love life. Yikes!

1314
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:47,207
Died right at a foot bowl. Bitch!

1315
01:23:50,167 --> 01:23:51,707
It's happening.

1316
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,417
I'll send you to the fiery inferno.

1317
01:23:57,792 --> 01:23:59,417
Trichada, what should we do?

1318
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:01,375
Just calm down, Usamanee.

1319
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:02,417
Take this!

1320
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,417
-Usamanee! Trichada!
-You want to see my bad side?

1321
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:17,792
Entities and demons,
Take them to the darkest part of hell!

1322
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,292
Ensnare them for eternity!

1323
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:50,875
Take them to hell!

1324
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:53,582
And never be reborn!

1325
01:24:57,207 --> 01:24:59,500
These threads from seven deadly graveyards

1326
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:04,207
shall tie your spirits together

1327
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,957
in this life, the next life,
or after life.

1328
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:12,332
I will avenge you everywhere you go.

1329
01:25:20,292 --> 01:25:21,207
Bury them.

1330
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,457
They have a ritual over there!

1331
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:26,375
Come on! Stop them!

1332
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:28,707
Kill them!

1333
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:29,750
Don't you dare!

1334
01:25:29,832 --> 01:25:32,250
Cappuccino Espresso!

1335
01:25:33,042 --> 01:25:34,000
Mocha Coco!

1336
01:25:36,292 --> 01:25:37,332
Fine!

1337
01:25:37,707 --> 01:25:39,917
Latte and Goodbye!

1338
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:59,167
Cappuccino Espresso!

1339
01:26:14,332 --> 01:26:16,292
Hurry up! Follow me!
Before it's too late.

1340
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:22,917
Usamanee! Trichada!

1341
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:26,625
Cappuccino Espresso!

1342
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:31,917
Phayoon! I'm coming for you!

1343
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,207
Finally!

1344
01:26:34,457 --> 01:26:37,167
This is your last day!

1345
01:26:37,417 --> 01:26:39,375
Cappuccino Espresso!

1346
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,750
Thank you, all of you,

1347
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,792
for saving us from eternal hell.

1348
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:52,417
You don't have to thank us.
You should thank Harry Potter.

1349
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,707
Thank you so much, My Lords.

1350
01:26:58,457 --> 01:27:00,292
She's right there, officers.

1351
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:02,332
That's the killer. That's her.

1352
01:27:02,457 --> 01:27:05,082
Phayoon murdered people in this building.

1353
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:07,707
-You sure?
-Yes. You can ask Tonmai.

1354
01:27:07,832 --> 01:27:09,832
-It's true!
-We are the witnesses.

1355
01:27:10,457 --> 01:27:11,792
-Take this.
-Get up now!

1356
01:27:11,957 --> 01:27:14,042
-Come on!
-It's not me!

1357
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:16,750
-I didn't kill anyone!
-Take her to prison!

1358
01:27:17,082 --> 01:27:19,250
I know the Director General!

1359
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,917
I can get you fired!
I don't know! I didn't kill anyone!

1360
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:23,042
I lost my shoe!

1361
01:27:23,207 --> 01:27:25,875
-My shoe!
-Later!

1362
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:29,500
Oh, help me!
I didn't kill them! Please help me!

1363
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:32,582
Taew?

1364
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:34,917
This is my mega project, my masterpiece.

1365
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,957
Your masterpiece?

1366
01:27:37,167 --> 01:27:40,042
It was Tonmai's idea.
He called the cops.

1367
01:27:40,417 --> 01:27:43,082
Tonmai told me and I told the police.

1368
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:46,957
Alright. You get credit too.

1369
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:50,667
And what will you give me as my reward?

1370
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:52,417
What should we reward her?

1371
01:27:52,707 --> 01:27:54,750
I'll give you a male sex doll.

1372
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:57,000
Thank you.

1373
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:59,332
I'll keep it
until I can play with it.

1374
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,292
Ladies and gentlemen!

1375
01:28:01,832 --> 01:28:03,832
Please welcome the Beauty Trio

1376
01:28:04,167 --> 01:28:05,167
and their performance!

1377
01:28:49,542 --> 01:28:51,000
-Usamanee.
-What?

1378
01:28:52,042 --> 01:28:53,542
Why don't you join them?

1379
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:54,707
No.

1380
01:28:55,042 --> 01:28:56,292
I want to stay with you.

1381
01:28:57,542 --> 01:28:58,542
It's alright.

1382
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,250
I can hang by myself.

1383
01:29:00,832 --> 01:29:03,457
You're thinking about him, aren't you?

1384
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:06,125
No.

1385
01:29:07,957 --> 01:29:09,082
You go have fun.

1386
01:29:09,917 --> 01:29:12,667
Will you be okay? Sure?

1387
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:17,500
I'm dying for a drink!

1388
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:51,332
May holy spirits

1389
01:29:51,957 --> 01:29:53,917
who reside around here

1390
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:56,125
please give me a chance

1391
01:29:57,082 --> 01:29:59,000
to meet Trichada once again

1392
01:29:59,707 --> 01:30:02,292
because I miss her so much.

1393
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:05,000
Trichada!

1394
01:30:06,832 --> 01:30:07,875
You've been standing here?

1395
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,792
So you heard everything I said.

1396
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:34,332
Thank you!

1397
01:30:37,082 --> 01:30:38,582
Have a good night!

1398
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:43,542
What are you doing here?

1399
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:47,167
-What's wrong?
-Are you okay?

1400
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:50,042
Let go of me! I'm not Aun.

1401
01:30:50,707 --> 01:30:52,000
What's the matter, handsome?

1402
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:53,542
Get out of my face!

1403
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:55,667
Grab him! He's possessed!

1404
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:57,582
-What?
-He's possessed!

1405
01:31:01,082 --> 01:31:03,542
Get out of my territory!

1406
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:25,469
Usamanee. What are you doing?

1407
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:27,957
I'm tipsy, Pancake.

1408
01:31:29,582 --> 01:31:31,082
Would you do me the honor?

1409
01:31:31,582 --> 01:31:32,542
My pleasure!

1410
01:31:56,042 --> 01:31:57,176
The End!

1411
01:31:57,327 --> 01:31:58,902
STAY TUNED FOR A BLOOPER REEL

1412
01:32:14,792 --> 01:32:16,707
-This is so much fun.
-It hurts.

1413
01:32:16,917 --> 01:32:18,582
-I'm having fun.
-But I feel pain!

1414
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:24,417
My feet look like prunes.

1415
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:26,042
The water is so dirty.

1416
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:27,125
Brown water.

1417
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:28,542
Like Leopard brand cough syrup.

1418
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:30,625
You know?

1419
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:31,707
Very funny.

1420
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:37,000
Bitch.

1421
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,250
Poi is dead!

1422
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:46,875
You're blocking me!

1423
01:32:49,292 --> 01:32:50,457
Whoops.

1424
01:32:50,792 --> 01:32:52,917
-Poi...
-I slipped on something.

1425
01:33:00,292 --> 01:33:02,957
What the hell are you doing?

1426
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:05,332
I saw you! I saw what you did.

1427
01:33:11,332 --> 01:33:13,000
Khoi! Did you just take a dump?

1428
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,125
Smells so nasty.

1429
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:18,755
I've never done
anything wrong in my life.

1430
01:33:22,042 --> 01:33:23,125
Just like Poj Arnon.

1431
01:33:29,027 --> 01:33:30,216
This is so disgusting.

1432
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:31,877
What kind of pose is that?

1433
01:33:32,082 --> 01:33:34,332
-Aunt Ji told me to.
-Ji who?

1434
01:33:34,457 --> 01:33:35,500
Ji Yoga Guru.

1435
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:36,917
She's prettier?

1436
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,500
Literally everyone
is prettier than you.

1437
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,207
Especially me and Aunt Ji.

1438
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:43,582
Take this!

1439
01:33:53,167 --> 01:33:54,042
Broke my headdress.

1440
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:00,542
Something's burning.

1441
01:34:03,082 --> 01:34:04,082
Stop!

1442
01:34:12,042 --> 01:34:14,042
