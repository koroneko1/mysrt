1
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:33,750
The Third World War ended swiftly,

2
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,875
thanks to the use of
modern military technology.

3
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:41,208
No victor emerged.

4
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:49,666
After the war,
only remnants of battle remained.

5
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,416
Pandemics and other threats followed.

6
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:58,291
Every life takes desperate measures
in the name of survival.

7
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,791
The era of technology is gone.

8
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,166
Humanity enters a dark age.

9
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,750
The strong live peacefully.

10
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:21,708
The weak starve and become victims.

11
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:31,083
Wealth represents everything
in this new society.

12
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,875
Just staying alive is a struggle.

13
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:40,333
It'll be your bum, not my bum

14
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:45,083
So I'll only hit yours

15
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:49,125
The Mon hides the knife
And I'll cut you from behind

16
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:54,375
Here, there are no laws, no rules.

17
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,750
It'll be your back, not my back
So I'll only stab you

18
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,625
Every life is borne out of atrocities.

19
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:15,875
"Kill or be killed" is the norm
every single minute of the day.

20
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,375
Hello, Sibthit.

21
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,875
We broke up.

22
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,125
Men can go fuck themselves.

23
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:35,083
The Mon hides the knife
And I'll cut you from the back

24
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:39,041
Whoever sits unaware
Shall be cut in the back

25
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,541
It'll be your back, not my back

26
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,583
So I'll only stab you

27
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,708
Run, what are you doing?

28
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,291
You're so heartless.

29
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,250
Don't you wanna eat?

30
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,625
Two bags, please.
I'll share them with the security guard.

31
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,750
The security guard
or your Burmese boyfriend?

32
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,375
My boyfriend is not Burmese. He's a Mon.

33
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,541
The Mon hides the dick
And I'll chew the head

34
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,250
It'll be your head, not my head

35
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:28,250
So I'll only chew your head

36
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,166
Head of what? Dic…

37
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,208
It's tonight.

38
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,958
Where are you off to, darling?

39
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,958
-Hello, Madame Runaway, how are you?
-I'm doing fine.

40
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,583
That's Madame Runaway.
She runs away from debtors.

41
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,583
Are you boys gonna keeping fighting
to the death?

42
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,166
Snakes!

43
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,083
How much is it?

44
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,083
Three hundred.

45
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,875
Here you are, 300.

46
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,333
Bitch. It's so expensive.

47
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,750
Study hard, boys,
so you can be like me when you grow up.

48
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,166
Want some?

49
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,958
Watch the bike.

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,583
You drive too fast.

51
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,875
It'll get you killed.

52
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,166
What is this?

53
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,708
Why do you always do that?

54
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,083
I hate it when a fly
lands on the tip of the straw.

55
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,875
Makes it too dirty to suck on it.

56
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,875
That's why you boys keep your dicks
pointing down in your underpants.

57
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,166
What?

58
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,166
Why do boys keep their dicks pointing down
in their underpants?

59
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,291
I don't know.

60
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,708
You really don't know?

61
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,500
Can I see?

62
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,125
Irene!

63
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,458
I don't wear underpants.

64
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,166
Really? Let me see.

65
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,125
Irene.

66
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,333
Fine, I won't look.

67
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,875
You're so uptight.

68
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,666
One round only.

69
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,541
First one to reach the goal wins.

70
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,791
Have you been in a game before?

71
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I've never lost one.

72
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,500
I'll give you a head start.

73
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,708
No need.

74
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,875
I've heard about you…

75
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,916
Irene.

76
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,708
Fear.

77
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,125
Run.

78
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:31,916
Careful.

79
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,541
Run!

80
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,166
Asshole! How would you throw in a knife!

81
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,083
Careful, Run.

82
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,625
Run.

83
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,291
Run.

84
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:32,791
Run!

85
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,416
Run, you won!

86
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,416
Run, you won!

87
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,125
We won!

88
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,208
Run.

89
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:31,125
I didn't expect your fighter
to end up like that.

90
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:38,083
Brother Ma, where did you find this girl?
Was she expensive?

91
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,416
Forget about it.

92
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,875
It's nothing like that.

93
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:56,083
Are you proud
of stabbing people in the back?

94
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,666
Do we know each other?

95
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,208
The fuck are you looking at?

96
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,583
Sorry, dude.

97
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,875
Wanna fight?

98
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,500
Leo, see Brother Ma off.

99
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,625
No need.

100
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,041
I'm familiar with this area.

101
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,416
I'm not worried about you getting lost.

102
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:39,541
I'm worried that you'll take my things
with you when you leave.

103
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:47,250
I never do things behind people's backs.

104
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,958
I do it in front of them,
when I'm looking into their eyes.

105
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:56,208
You'll have a heart attack.

106
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,250
Irene.

107
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,125
But I didn't do anything.

108
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:50,166
If you don't know me,
then you don't have the right to judge me.

109
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,166
Let it go, Run.

110
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,833
Come on, Fear.

111
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,750
Let's go. Come on.

112
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,041
He's so hot.

113
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,916
If you hadn't stopped me,
they'd be dead meat by now.

114
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,583
Dead meat? You're the one who started it.

115
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,958
You always cause trouble.

116
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,791
You two, wait for me in the car.

117
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:15,750
Yes, sir.

118
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,083
Listen.

119
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,208
If you want to keep working for me,
you need to…

120
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,000
Again.

121
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,666
Understand?

122
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,750
Yes, sir.

123
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,708
Make way.

124
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,291
The big shot is here.

125
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:52,000
What are you looking at?
I should slap your face with money.

126
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,750
Make way.

127
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,375
Run.

128
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,750
Your share.

129
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,416
Thank you so much.

130
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,958
Are you crazy? Don't you want money?

131
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,583
Look, this is big money.

132
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,541
Run.

133
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,958
Do you know that woman was?

134
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,208
No.

135
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,750
I have no idea why she's so angry.

136
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,625
You know, the guy who was with her
is so handsome.

137
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,791
I just said he's handsome,
it's not like I want him.

138
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:39,166
I'm hurt, and all you care about is men.

139
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,875
I know you're good,

140
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,458
or I wouldn't have asked you
to join the game.

141
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:47,750
CRACK THE GAME DOWN

142
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,333
If they can't stop it,
they should legalize it.

143
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,208
There are so many gambling dens.

144
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,625
They'll never get rid of them all.

145
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,875
"Tradi-Fornication"?

146
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:04,125
If it's a fornication game,
I'd like to join myself.

147
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,416
Tradition shouldn't be this fucked up.

148
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,625
They know nothing
about passing on traditions.

149
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:17,666
Run, don't be so sensitive,
or I'll smash your face in.

150
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,041
If you win Tradi-Fornication,
you'll be rich.

151
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,458
Hey.

152
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,208
Stop it.

153
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,250
Okay.

154
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,375
Will you be sending your team
to Tradi-Fornication this year?

155
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,125
You just got here.

156
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,583
Eat something first.
Let's talk business later.

157
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,958
Still don't trust me, huh?

158
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,291
The police are outdated.

159
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:10,500
If I were you,
I'd have a soldier around instead.

160
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,833
It's safer.

161
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,375
Kavin, why should you be the Gamemaster?

162
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:25,458
I can handle Tradi-Fornication
without you.

163
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:30,250
But will the others accept you
as the Gamemaster?

164
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:36,375
Besides, I hear
Boss hasn't had much use for you lately.

165
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,458
Well, to answer your question…

166
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,041
they'll accept me
when you're no longer around.

167
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,041
I come here to invite you politely
to be the manager.

168
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:55,291
If you think you can be the Gamemaster,
be my guest.

169
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,625
Kavin, even your server got shut down.

170
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,166
Your management style is outdated.

171
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,708
Why don't you let someone else manage it?

172
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,375
Are you in or not?

173
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,791
That's all I need to know!

174
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,041
Brother Ma.

175
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,500
Don't open the lid
or the congee will get cold.

176
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,583
You have to be careful.

177
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,625
It can burn your hands.

178
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,666
What is this?

179
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,208
Do you get scalds very often?

180
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,916
Why do you need this balm, then?

181
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,416
I'm a clumsy man.

182
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,666
Is that so?

183
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:03,750
Then you should let Mr. Kavin do his job.

184
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,125
We can talk about this another time.

185
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,500
Mr. Kavin is looked after by the police.

186
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,208
Maybe you should wait
till you find a soldier

187
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,416
to look after you.

188
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:36,708
Very well.

189
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,666
I'll send someone to participate.

190
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,875
This year,
we need a sponsor fee of 30 million.

191
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:55,333
If I win, all the sponsor fees go to me.

192
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,916
Deal.

193
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,291
What's the rush?

194
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,333
Come on, eat something.

195
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:09,791
I hate Chinese food.

196
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,125
You made the right choice.

197
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:31,291
The only thing you're good at, Kavin,
is kissing Boss's ass.

198
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:38,083
If you'd let me carry a gun,
they would've been dead by now.

199
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,166
So what if they're cops.

200
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,916
You'd kill a cop?

201
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,625
I'm your right-hand man.

202
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,083
I'd do anything for you.

203
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,333
Check if the congee has turned cold.

204
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,541
It's still hot.

205
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:10,750
I told you, I'm your right-hand man.
I'd do anything for you.

206
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,541
But I'm left-handed.

207
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:42,791
Are you sure this is what you want?

208
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:47,166
I'm sure.

209
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:52,458
In order to end Tradi-Fornication
and this outrageous status quo,

210
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,125
we must take down Kavin.

211
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:14,458
Even if you manage to take him down,

212
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,541
someone else is just gonna take his place.

213
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,750
I know.

214
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,708
But it's better than doing nothing.

215
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,458
Okay. I'll get intel on him for you.

216
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:19,875
What do you want?

217
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,666
If this was a brothel,
I'd be here for something else,

218
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,375
but since this is a garage,
I'm here about my car.

219
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:35,875
What's wrong with it?

220
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,791
The radiator's broken.

221
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:50,958
Is it leaking?

222
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,375
Wanna check for yourself?

223
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,625
I need to know if it should be changed.

224
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:04,708
TRADI-FORNICATION

225
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:08,083
Don't tell me you're interested in joining
Tradi-Fornication.

226
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:13,416
I see. You're like a moth
being drawn to the flame.

227
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,791
Do you want your car fixed or not?

228
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:17,958
I don't have all day.

229
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,333
Are you in a hurry?

230
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:22,125
Let's just get it done.

231
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,708
Let's get yours wet.

232
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,625
Excuse me. Check, please.

233
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,541
Bring me a burger.

234
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:21,875
Put it on the tab.

235
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:27,208
I meant my tab.

236
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,333
What do you want?

237
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,041
Kavin asked me to approach you.

238
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,500
For Tradi-Fornication?

239
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:50,666
But you're a cop.

240
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:55,875
I want a comfortable life.

241
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:03,000
In case you're wondering
why I work for him.

242
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,750
A lowlife like you…

243
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:11,291
I'm not surprised at all
that you would work for him.

244
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,791
You'll make a lot of money.

245
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,125
Just because I let you buy me a meal

246
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:23,916
doesn't mean I'll whore myself out to you.

247
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:27,791
Calm down.

248
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,500
Nobody is whoring anyone out.

249
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:32,666
Really?

250
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,583
But I can smell a whore nearby.

251
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:41,291
A burger for you.

252
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,291
Wait.

253
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,625
Can you bring me a McWhore burger?

254
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:53,875
Just the burger, hold the whore.

255
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:56,625
There's a whore right here.

256
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,750
You mean him?

257
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:05,250
Haven't you met a manwhore before?

258
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,250
Why are you still here?

259
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,041
Fuck off.

260
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:16,875
I get it.

261
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,583
I know you must think I'm a crooked cop.

262
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Not just that.

263
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,875
I think you're a scumbag too.

264
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:43,750
Everyone has their own reasons
for doing what they do.

265
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,083
Catch my drift?

266
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:50,166
You should join the game.

267
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:55,791
It's not easy for someone
without sponsorship to get an invitation.

268
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,833
This is a good opportunity for you.

269
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:04,958
You didn't listen
to a thing I said, did you?

270
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:11,916
Anyway, thank you for the meal.

271
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,708
McWhore burger for you.

272
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:22,791
Are you tired?

273
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,083
Why should we listen to Kavin?

274
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:31,875
Boss is the one
who calls the shots anyway.

275
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,833
But we don't know who's backing Kavin.

276
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,916
We could be right at the top.

277
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:45,375
We don't need Kavin's help to do that.

278
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:56,166
I can find the sponsor fee
to send you to Tradi-Fornication.

279
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:01,000
If you win, you can meet Boss.

280
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,416
We'll get rid of him.

281
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:08,000
Together.

282
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:10,458
Then we'll both be the new Boss.

283
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,083
I'm serious.

284
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:20,083
And where will you get the sponsor fee?

285
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,083
Don't worry about that.

286
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,666
I'll get it from the officials.

287
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:34,083
I'll get rid of Kavin and Boss.

288
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,458
Then we'll have all the money
we could ever want.

289
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:46,250
Are you working for the officials…

290
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,458
or are you working for Kavin?

291
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,583
Don't worry.

292
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,416
I'm working for you.

293
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,750
Run, did you send all your money
to your mom?

294
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,375
Brother Ma sent his man to ask me

295
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:10,041
if you'd want to join Tradi-Fornication.

296
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,750
On the delivery day,

297
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:23,791
there won't be many guards
in Kavin's casino.

298
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:27,375
Most of his men
will be sent to work outside.

299
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,083
Kavin will be working on the accounts

300
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,333
and issue orders from his office upstairs.

301
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,208
That's our window.

302
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,833
I know the risks, but it's better than
living with the status quo.

303
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,500
If more Kavins take his place
after I kill him,

304
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,458
I'll just keep getting rid of them.

305
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,916
Stop!

306
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,041
Enough!

307
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:08,416
You're messing up my joint.

308
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:17,333
You, come here.

309
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,708
Are you Fear?

310
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,708
You're a tough one.

311
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:34,250
Be careful.

312
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:40,166
Whose side is that cop on anyway?

313
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,250
His name is Payu.

314
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:52,375
I don't know
if he's a spy for the officials?

315
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,791
Maybe he's just looking out for himself.

316
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,625
No one can rely on the officials.

317
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:04,791
Run.

318
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:06,958
Run.

319
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,125
Run!

320
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,041
What?

321
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:15,333
There's word going around
in the group chat

322
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:18,041
that Kavin will reveal his pick
for Tradi-Fornication soon.

323
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,166
Who's it gonna be?

324
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,375
Oh, you're up.

325
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,083
That's enough.

326
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,625
Let's have a friendly chat.

327
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,166
I'm not interested.

328
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:59,583
Do you know
how many of my men you've killed?

329
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,875
You've shot up my house.

330
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:06,583
I've heard a lot about you,
and you've lived up to your reputation.

331
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:08,458
Not bad.

332
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,625
I know you're a loyal girl too.

333
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,166
It was so easy to find them.

334
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,708
I have a lot of people working for me.

335
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:28,833
You son of a bitch!

336
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:35,416
Trust me and do as I say,

337
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:40,291
and you'll make a fortune.

338
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,958
If you win, that is.

339
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:54,708
Yes, Boss?

340
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,458
What's your problem?

341
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:07,333
I've asked you a million times…

342
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:11,208
but you always rejected my offer.

343
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:14,541
What changed your mind?

344
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
Why are you approaching me this time?

345
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,666
I want to make money.

346
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:35,583
Do you know what drives people to fight?

347
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,333
Hunger.

348
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Desire.

349
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:54,083
If you're hungry,
you can survive off of trash.

350
00:42:55,875 --> 00:43:02,875
But humans will always desire to eat
and live better than others.

351
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:35,500
People with no discipline
always cause violence.

352
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:40,041
Do you know how we can create social order
and stop violence?

353
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:50,750
By being more violent than them.

354
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:54,208
If I don't do that,

355
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:57,291
I can't rule over them.

356
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:04,041
If you want to stand at the top,
you have to be decisive.

357
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,166
I agree.

358
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:11,333
I've never seen anyone
as decisive as you, Brother Ma.

359
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:15,250
We all need to work for someone,

360
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:18,458
so that society can continue to exist.

361
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:23,166
Even if someone
at the top of the food chain

362
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:27,041
gets consumed at the end,

363
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,500
that's the circle of life.

364
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:35,708
Who are you working for, then?

365
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:39,291
I've never seen his face.

366
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:46,916
But he will decide
if I'm allowed to be your sponsor.

367
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:51,875
Now that you know about Boss,

368
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:56,250
there are only two ways
that you can leave this place.

369
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:58,333
First,

370
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:00,583
as someone who works for Boss.

371
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Second…

372
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:09,625
as a corpse.

373
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,125
Yes, sir.

374
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:42,791
What did Boss say?

375
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,708
You're lucky that…

376
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:55,208
I won't need to use this liquid.

377
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:01,291
And that means…

378
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,416
I'll be your sponsor.

379
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,791
Where have you been all week?

380
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:22,083
We're going to join Tradi-Fornication.

381
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:24,666
You…

382
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:26,666
and who?

383
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,583
Payu?

384
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,416
No, silly, I mean us.

385
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:39,541
Kavin's already announced
that he'll be Fear's sponsor.

386
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:41,625
Didn't you hear?

387
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,416
I can find us a sponsor.

388
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:46,958
If we win,

389
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:50,541
we don't need to work for Kavin anymore.

390
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:53,791
It doesn't matter.

391
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,625
Even when Kavin's gone,

392
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,833
you'll spread your legs for someone else.

393
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:01,333
You think I don't know that?

394
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,875
It'd be strange if you didn't.

395
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,666
You mean me and Payu, right?

396
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,000
Everyone.

397
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:17,416
You've fucked everyone on this planet,
except me.

398
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,916
I never had a chance.

399
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:21,500
Do you want to fuck me?

400
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:28,666
Once you're inside me,

401
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:33,000
you'll be no different
from all the other men in the world.

402
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:40,041
You think I'm stupid enough
not to fuck you?

403
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,750
If everybody can fuck you, then so can I!

404
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,583
Those men didn't fuck me.

405
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,083
I fucked them.

406
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:55,833
You're important to me
because I haven't fucked you.

407
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:01,666
Don't like doing it from the front?

408
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,333
I'll let you do it from behind.

409
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,416
But if you fuck me,

410
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,583
you'll be just another man to me.

411
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:54,500
They've announced the contestants
for this year's Tradi-Fornication.

412
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:58,208
Imbecile.

413
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:00,791
Where have you been?
Everyone knows already.

414
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:03,333
One of the contestants
is from this neighborhood.

415
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:04,375
Can I see?

416
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,625
It's Happy.

417
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,166
Happy.

418
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,250
-Hmm?
-Mmm.

419
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:14,125
What?

420
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:25,791
Let's go.

421
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:37,208
Leo.

422
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:39,916
Do I look pretty?

423
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:42,875
Yeah.

424
00:49:58,416 --> 00:49:59,750
Get rid of him.

425
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:03,083
Yes, sir.

426
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:18,833
Damn it!

427
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,833
How dare she do this to me?!

428
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:25,583
Sir.

429
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:30,208
Why didn't you get rid of them
before they applied?

430
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:34,708
They did everything by the rules.

431
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
Should we…

432
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:47,875
cancel the game?

433
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,541
The stakes are too high.

434
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:57,291
I can't let some slutty cunt
destroy my business.

435
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:01,666
If she wants to die
like a dog on the street, let her.

436
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:12,375
Who do you think is gonna win
out of these seven teams?

437
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:14,125
I couldn't care less.

438
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:17,625
Whoever wins or loses, we get paid anyway.

439
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:24,250
Will the winner get to meet Boss?

440
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,458
None of your business.

441
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,250
Good day to our beloved audience.

442
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:38,916
Welcome to the first match of our game.

443
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,416
It's our member's favorite,
much-loved, much-admired game.

444
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,583
It's the game of future and death.

445
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:54,166
The fight that will help our contestants
escape poverty.

446
00:51:54,875 --> 00:52:00,041
This is the first time
our contestants face each other.

447
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:04,416
Let's meet the contestants
of our Tradi-Fornication game.

448
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,916
Pay attention, now.

449
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,916
It's Tradi-Fornication, not fornication.

450
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:39,333
What has been the upper class's method

451
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:45,500
to control the working class
since ancient times?

452
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,208
A great show.

453
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,750
Giant stadiums.

454
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:55,125
Why do you think
the Romans built the Colosseum?

455
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,416
People got so excited
to watch others get killed

456
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:03,666
that they forgot
how miserable their own lives were.

457
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:08,416
That made it easy
for the rulers to control them.

458
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,875
The rules are the same
as the real musical chairs.

459
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:39,583
There are six chairs and seven teams.

460
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:43,708
All teams must drive in circles
until the music stops.

461
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:48,125
When the music stops, the players
need to plant themselves on the chairs.

462
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:51,791
Those who don't find a chair
will be eliminated.

463
00:53:56,333 --> 00:54:01,916
However, the speed of the bikes
cannot cross the limit into the red zone.

464
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:37,458
You may be curious about
what will happen if they do.

465
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:42,208
If the speed crosses into the red zone
while the music is still playing,

466
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:44,625
this is what will happen.

467
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:50,083
Well, you saw what happened.

468
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:58,666
It's time to eliminate another team.

469
00:54:58,750 --> 00:54:59,916
We have one round left.

470
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,208
Those who fail to find a chair
won't get a second chance.

471
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:13,750
Let's speed this up a little bit
for our audiences back home.

472
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:16,125
Just a little bit.

473
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:17,666
Hurry up!

474
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:25,416
The music has stopped.

475
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:29,916
Whoever sits first occupies the chair.

476
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,583
It's bye-bye
to those who fail to find a chair.

477
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:02,083
Move the server.
Don't let the officials find it.

478
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:08,750
Don't forget to send me
the view rate and user ratings.

479
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:10,416
Bye.

480
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:29,875
Boss?

481
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:32,625
Did I give you permission to look at me?

482
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:35,916
I'm sorry, sir.

483
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:44,291
These belonged to the last person
who dared to look at me.

484
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:49,458
I was just trying to make sure it was you.

485
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:51,875
How can you be sure?

486
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:59,958
I watched today's broadcast.

487
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,166
You managed everything well.

488
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:06,208
Thank you, sir.

489
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,583
I called you here today

490
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:14,250
because I wanted to remind you
that I still exist.

491
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:20,750
Don't ever give me the feeling
that you think you're better than me,

492
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:25,208
because I can have you replaced
in a second.

493
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:27,000
Yes, sir.

494
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,291
A present for you.

495
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:41,333
Proof that you're still my favorite.

496
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:06,041
Thank you so much, sir.

497
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:09,916
Can I ask you…

498
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,083
Sorry.

499
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,166
Did I close my eyes?

500
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:42,166
Thank you.

501
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:44,041
Happy.

502
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:48,500
Run. What are you doing here?

503
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:52,208
I've been looking everywhere for you.

504
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:57,875
I'm spending time with my fans.

505
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,333
Why are you out here? It's dangerous.

506
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:04,125
Look, Run.

507
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,000
Let me ask you something.

508
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:10,125
What's the point of getting famous
if we don't enjoy the fame?

509
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:13,208
Really?

510
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,875
Do you really think they idolize you?

511
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:24,708
What if people supporting another team
send someone to abduct us?

512
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:28,791
You're overthinking it, there's no danger.

513
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:30,041
Make way.

514
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:31,875
You are so annoying.

515
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,166
The game isn't over.

516
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,291
It's not the time to die.

517
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,041
Where have you been?

518
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:36,541
Checking feedback.

519
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,125
It's strange.

520
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:42,000
People remember us better
when we do bad things.

521
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:46,291
There are two matches left.

522
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,041
You should tell me when you go out.

523
01:03:50,666 --> 01:03:53,416
Why? Worried someone's gonna kill me?

524
01:03:57,791 --> 01:03:58,791
Leo…

525
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,125
Wanna join me in the shower?

526
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,291
You should've waited for me.

527
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:43,875
I was hungry.

528
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:48,708
-Did you buy some food?
-Yeah.

529
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:53,708
Did you really need to put on a disguise?

530
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:57,416
I wouldn't have made it back if I hadn't.

531
01:04:57,916 --> 01:05:01,083
Why are people so crazy for us?
We're the same as before.

532
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:03,958
You sure about that?

533
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:09,541
Do you know who I really am?

534
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:11,875
You're a brat.

535
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:12,958
Shut up.

536
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,500
Are you afraid?

537
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:26,583
Of course.

538
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:34,041
Will you be okay…

539
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,250
for tomorrow?

540
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:38,791
Is it okay to not be okay?

541
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:21,375
Leo.

542
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Run.

543
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:01,958
I'm scared.

544
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:26,333
This is the semi-final.

545
01:07:26,416 --> 01:07:30,666
The surviving contestants
will move on to the finals.

546
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,958
For the enjoyment
of our sadistic audiences

547
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:34,958
watching live across the country,

548
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:38,083
the semi-final round game is…

549
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:40,875
Humming and Tagging.

550
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:52,333
What a shitty game.

551
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:55,500
I would've been a better Gamemaster.

552
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:58,250
Don't underestimate this round.

553
01:07:58,333 --> 01:08:00,708
This is not
the children's game you remember.

554
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:03,500
The team members
who are not captives must dive

555
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:07,000
and look for the keys
to save their partners

556
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,416
before they are asphyxiated.

557
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:14,666
Those who save their partners in time

558
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,750
will make it into the finals.

559
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:19,166
If they fail, they'll be eliminated.

560
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:07,791
If you are ready…

561
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:42,458
Irene.

562
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,375
Go. Go.

563
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:51,750
Hey.

564
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:04,833
I'll handle it.

565
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:34,166
Our merciful patron
has thrown in another key.

566
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:40,041
Big applause for Mr. Kavin.

567
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:43,458
Cruel, yet benevolent.

568
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,000
Hey.

569
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:39,208
Hey.

570
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,250
Shit!

571
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:48,083
-We have the winners for the finals round.
-Happy!

572
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:53,791
-But now, a dramatic scene is unfolding.
-Happy!

573
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,500
Happy!

574
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:58,625
Happy! Happy!

575
01:13:59,416 --> 01:14:00,416
Wake up.

576
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:03,916
Somebody please help!

577
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,500
Help!

578
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:08,750
Happy. Wake up.

579
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:22,250
Step aside.

580
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:29,916
Wake up, Happy.

581
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:39,583
Please wake up.

582
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,250
Wake up!

583
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:43,875
Wake up!

584
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,416
Wake up!

585
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:13,833
Wow!

586
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Perfect.

587
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:33,708
Why are you filming me?

588
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:35,791
Film the corpse. The audiences love it.

589
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:37,958
There's blood everywhere. Pan down there.

590
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:05,208
Between me and Fear, who do you love more?

591
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:07,791
Why do you ask me this?

592
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:10,083
You saved her before me, that's why.

593
01:16:18,833 --> 01:16:20,333
Why'd you help her?

594
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:33,166
I should be asking you why you didn't.

595
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:35,750
You know CPR.

596
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:39,500
We should get rid of our rivals.

597
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:41,625
Hey.

598
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:44,708
That woman saved you.

599
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:49,750
Run saved you when you were drowning.

600
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:53,125
That was part of the game.

601
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Fear.

602
01:16:57,916 --> 01:16:59,333
What happened to you?

603
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:04,041
You're not the person I knew.

604
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,000
Ever since…

605
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:14,833
Since when?

606
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,416
Since you fucked that bitch.

607
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,708
It's almost the final round.
Are you excited?

608
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:27,916
Right now, I just want to punch that cop.

609
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:31,083
Why? Are you jealous?

610
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:37,500
If I ever got the chance,
I'd crush him like a bug.

611
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:42,083
You're so cute when you're jealous.

612
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:51,958
Look at you, you're copying me.

613
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:58,250
Just like me
when I was kidnapped and sold…

614
01:17:58,333 --> 01:18:00,208
I saw a girl doing it, and I copied her.

615
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,541
Remember the story I told you before?

616
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:09,083
When I was a child,

617
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:14,958
I saw someone in danger,
but I looked the other way.

618
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:18,708
"Hide the Knife"?

619
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:31,875
I think Fear is that girl.

620
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:36,833
Plenty of people get stabbed
in this world full of selfish humans.

621
01:18:45,916 --> 01:18:47,500
If I can save someone…

622
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:53,541
it might help me sleep better at night.

623
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:58,541
I won't have to wake up to the image
of a knife thrusting into someone's back.

624
01:18:59,708 --> 01:19:00,916
That's none of your business.

625
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,750
She has nothing to do with this!

626
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:09,625
You've let your lust for her
get to your head.

627
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,958
Wouldn't you fuck her
if you had the chance?

628
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:19,458
Look into my eyes and tell me.

629
01:19:19,541 --> 01:19:22,958
Wouldn't you fuck this woman
that you call a slut?

630
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:24,458
Are you fucking crazy?!

631
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:29,833
You haven't answered me.

632
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:40,000
I'd never fuck her.

633
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:50,375
You didn't save her
because you wanted redemption.

634
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:58,750
I know what you're thinking, Run.

635
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:07,000
You want to fuck her,
just like I want to get fucked by Sibthit.

636
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:31,958
Fear.

637
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,166
Did you come here to stab me?

638
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:43,291
Tomorrow is the final round.

639
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,250
And?

640
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,416
We may never meet again.

641
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:57,875
So what?

642
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:05,083
Oh.

643
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:12,875
Haven't seen you in a while.

644
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,250
You're mean.

645
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:23,250
If I was mean to you,
you wouldn't be here.

646
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:53,833
Good night.

647
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,250
Where's Irene?

648
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,208
She should be on standby.

649
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:57,250
Maybe the toilet?

650
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:29,791
There's no shortcut in life.

651
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:34,500
But there's a lot for us to enjoy.

652
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:50,958
It's time to start.

653
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:57,583
Let's begin, then, shall we?

654
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:03,333
I hope I get my money's worth.

655
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:23,583
We're ready to start the live stream.

656
01:24:23,666 --> 01:24:25,458
In this final round,

657
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:32,125
we'll play a forgotten game
from our childhood.

658
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:34,458
Hide the Cloth!

659
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:38,625
Fucking liar!

660
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:40,250
Kiss-ass!

661
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:45,375
But at Tradi-Fornication, we won't play
the usual version of Hide the Cloth.

662
01:24:45,458 --> 01:24:51,041
Mr. Kavin has chosen the Mon,
the player who will start the game.

663
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:54,041
Please give Mr. Kavin a big hand.

664
01:24:56,916 --> 01:24:59,750
We're transparent.

665
01:24:59,833 --> 01:25:03,666
We'll start with the surgeon.

666
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:09,416
Care to place a bet
on any of our contestants?

667
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:12,500
-Boss has sent you a message, sir.
-Let's not waste any time.

668
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:16,500
This is the finals. Who will survive
and who will be eliminated?

669
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:18,083
Who lives or dies?

670
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:20,208
Win or lose?

671
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:22,125
Our website is open to everybody.

672
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:26,666
Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy the game.

673
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:28,625
Boss wants to meet me.

674
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:42,375
Players sit in a circle
and sing the "Hide the Cloth" song.

675
01:25:42,458 --> 01:25:44,708
The Mon holds a piece of cloth,
walks in circle,

676
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:47,541
and drops a cloth behind a player.

677
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:49,875
The player who has the cloth
behind their back

678
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:52,875
must pick up the cloth
and chase the Mon who dropped it.

679
01:25:52,958 --> 01:25:55,750
If the Mon is caught,
he or she is eliminated.

680
01:25:56,166 --> 01:25:59,625
If the Mon sits down before being caught,

681
01:25:59,708 --> 01:26:05,875
the one who holds the cloth
will become the Mon for the next round.

682
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:10,833
The Mon hides the cloth
The doll lurks behind…

683
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:15,708
Whoever sits unaware
Shall be hit on the bum

684
01:26:15,791 --> 01:26:20,333
It'll be your bum, not my bum

685
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:24,750
So I'll only hit yours

686
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:30,333
The Mon hides the cloth
The doll lurks behind

687
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:35,291
Whoever sits unaware
Shall be hit on the bum

688
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:39,833
It'll be your bum, not my bum

689
01:26:39,916 --> 01:26:44,041
So I'll only hit yours

690
01:26:44,791 --> 01:26:48,833
The Mon hides the cloth
The doll lurks behind

691
01:26:48,916 --> 01:26:53,708
Whoever sits unaware
Shall be hit on the bum

692
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:57,791
It'll be your bum, not my bum

693
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:03,500
So I'll only hit yours

694
01:27:03,583 --> 01:27:07,750
The Mon hides the cloth
The doll lurks behind

695
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:12,375
Whoever sits unaware
Shall be hit on the bum

696
01:27:12,458 --> 01:27:17,000
It'll be your bum, not my bum

697
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:21,291
So I'll only hit yours

698
01:27:22,333 --> 01:27:27,666
The Mon hides the knife
I'll cut you from behind

699
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:31,916
Whoever sits unaware
Shall be stabbed in the back

700
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,250
It'll be on your back, not my back

701
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:40,625
So I'll only stab you

702
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:45,500
The Mon hides the knife
I'll cut you from behind

703
01:27:45,583 --> 01:27:49,916
Whoever sits unaware
Shall be stabbed in the back

704
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,208
It'll be on your back, not my back

705
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:56,666
So I'll only stab you

706
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:00,500
Think the cloth would just land on you?

707
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:03,208
If it's not there, you have to shed blood.

708
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:07,666
Whoever sits unaware
Shall be shot in the head

709
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:12,208
It'll be your head, not my head

710
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:16,875
So I'll only shoot yours

711
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:21,750

Shall be stabbed in the back

713
01:28:26,875 --> 01:28:31,291
It'll be on your back, not my back

714
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:36,416
So I'll only stab you

715
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:40,625
The Mon hides the knife
I'll cut you from behind

716
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:45,250
Whoever sits unaware
Shall be stabbed in the back

717
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:49,875
It'll be on your back, not my back

718
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:54,583
So I'll only stab you

719
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,958

721
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:11,791

722
01:29:12,291 --> 01:29:17,000
It'll be on your back, not my back

723
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:44,500
The Mon hides the gun
I'll shoot you down

724
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:50,000
Whoever sits unaware
Shall be shot in the head

725
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:55,541
It'll be your head, not my head

726
01:29:55,625 --> 01:30:00,541
So I'll only shoot yours

727
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:05,625
The Mon hides the gun
I'll shoot you down

728
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:11,000
Whoever sits unaware
Shall be shot in the head

729
01:30:11,541 --> 01:30:16,416
It'll be your head, not my head

730
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:21,750
So I'll only shoot yours

731
01:30:31,166 --> 01:30:32,166
Irene.

732
01:30:51,291 --> 01:30:53,125
Impossible.

733
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:55,250
What happened?

734
01:30:58,875 --> 01:31:01,041
I asked you what happened.

735
01:31:01,125 --> 01:31:02,666
The live stream stopped.

736
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,541
Our server may have been shut down.

737
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:05,750
What the hell?!

738
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:21,791
Fear, I'm sorry.

739
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:25,291
I didn't help you that day.

740
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:47,375
What's happening?

741
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:12,041
It'll be your head, not my head

742
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:15,708
So I'll only shoot yours

743
01:32:17,166 --> 01:32:19,333
You were supposed to shoot me in the head.

744
01:32:42,375 --> 01:32:43,375
Like it?

745
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,875
This is the Gun of Absolute Authority.

746
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:48,583
Boss…

747
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:07,250
You wanted to know who Boss is?

748
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:41,333
This smoke gets absorbed
into your blood stream quickly.

749
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:46,375
Don't fucking look at me!
Look at the smoke!

750
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:49,833
See? Your body is absorbing it!

751
01:34:54,125 --> 01:34:55,125
Irene…

752
01:34:56,041 --> 01:34:57,041
Please…

753
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:08,833
What is the truth?

754
01:35:11,083 --> 01:35:12,083
What?

755
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:16,166
What did you ask me?

756
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:20,458
You dared to ask me for the truth?

757
01:35:21,541 --> 01:35:24,541
You want to know what the truth is?

758
01:35:32,166 --> 01:35:34,958
Would you like to know the truth?

759
01:35:35,833 --> 01:35:37,125
I'll tell you.

760
01:35:38,625 --> 01:35:40,041
The truth…

761
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,291
is…

762
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:46,791
the game.

763
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:51,875
The game you're playing right now
is the truth.

764
01:35:53,583 --> 01:35:56,458
Humming and Tagging.
Catching the last one in the line.

765
01:35:58,375 --> 01:35:59,916
Hide the Cloth.

766
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:06,333
Isn't it true?
Isn't that the truth of life?

767
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:08,208
Did you have fun playing it?

768
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:13,500
You played them.

769
01:36:15,041 --> 01:36:16,541
You smiled.

770
01:36:16,625 --> 01:36:17,875
You laughed.

771
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:20,666
You sweated.

772
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:23,000
Bitch.

773
01:36:23,833 --> 01:36:25,375
This is the truth.

774
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,958
These games should be children's reality,
not their phones!

775
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:32,333
This is the truth!

776
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,833
Let me go.

777
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,916
Don't touch me!

778
01:36:42,875 --> 01:36:44,083
Every child…

779
01:36:50,166 --> 01:36:53,583
should be free to do what they want.

780
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:57,416
They shouldn't be locked up.

781
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,208
They shouldn't be raped!

782
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:01,875
Do you understand? This is the truth!

783
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:19,958
We…

784
01:37:20,041 --> 01:37:21,916
We can stop it.

785
01:37:30,333 --> 01:37:36,125
We can stop it together…

786
01:37:37,416 --> 01:37:40,083
without those barbaric men.

787
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:49,666
Do you actually believe that?

788
01:37:55,666 --> 01:37:59,458
It shouldn't end like this.

789
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:04,291
Don't you understand?

790
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:11,125
Irene…

791
01:38:14,416 --> 01:38:15,416
People…

792
01:38:16,916 --> 01:38:23,208
need help.

793
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:28,000
Help?

794
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:31,208
What fucking help? I don't need any help!

795
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:34,166
Stop talking nonsense!

796
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:35,416
Stop!

797
01:38:49,208 --> 01:38:50,291
Cry.

798
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:52,125
Cry.

799
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:07,250
Beg for your life.
Beg me to spare your life.

800
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:09,000
Beg me.

801
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:04,666
This world is only for the strong.

802
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:09,458
The weak will not survive.

803
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:13,416
History is written by the victors.

804
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:17,083
That old saying
about good triumphing over evil…

805
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:23,291
It's just nonsense
that weaklings use to comfort themselves.

806
01:40:23,791 --> 01:40:26,416
Righteousness belongs to winners,

807
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:34,208
especially in a world where people
step on each other to get to the top.

808
01:41:21,916 --> 01:41:22,958
Boss?

809
01:41:30,666 --> 01:41:31,958
What happened?

810
01:41:34,666 --> 01:41:36,708
Did I give you permission to look at me?

811
01:41:39,541 --> 01:41:41,458
I'm sorry, Boss. I'm so sorry.

812
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:43,125
I'm so sorry.

813
01:41:56,958 --> 01:41:58,750
You must be wondering what happened here.

814
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:03,916
I've just overturned the board
to start a new game.

815
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:09,708
They were getting too close to me.

816
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:14,916
They didn't follow my rules.

817
01:42:15,625 --> 01:42:19,916
In the end, there can only be one winner:

818
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Me.

819
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:34,750
Look.

820
01:42:35,833 --> 01:42:38,333
These are the eyeballs
of someone who stared at me.

821
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:45,250
To stand above all others,
you must be decisive.

822
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:47,916
Don't you think so, Brother Ma?

823
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:55,291
Do your duty as best as you can…

824
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,416
because I'll be keeping an eye on you.

825
01:43:02,458 --> 01:43:06,791
From now on,
no one is more important than you.

826
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:11,791
Thank you so much, Boss.

827
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:13,583
Thank you so much.

828
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:43,833
Hide the clues, distort and betray

829
01:43:43,916 --> 01:43:48,625
Trick you here and there
I'll make a fool of you

830
01:43:48,708 --> 01:43:53,500
I'll make a fool of you, not of my heart

831
01:43:53,583 --> 01:43:57,916
Only I will make a fool of you
