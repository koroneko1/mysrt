1
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,166
You spoiled brat! You brat, where are you?

2
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,583
You think you can escape from me?

3
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,333
Help me!

4
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,583
Help me!

5
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,583
It's okay, my child. Don't cry.

6
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,708
Look at your brothers and sisters.

7
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,791
They are such good kids.

8
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,375
Hey, Pom, are you sure that Chaba
was the one who abducted the kids?

9
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:13,000
You're sure about that?
She looks so frail.

10
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,791
She can barely walk.

11
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,708
I heard Pang's voice coming from in here.

12
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,166
Where could Chaba be?

13
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,666
The house is this small.

14
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,958
Be still, my child.

15
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,458
So you won't be afraid to look
at me anymore.

16
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,416
Don't worry, it won't hurt.

17
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,041
I'll be quick.

18
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,583
-Get out!
-Hey!

19
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,833
-Mom, help me!
-Who did this to you?

20
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,208
Don't you mess with my kid!

21
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,916
No! Stop!

22
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,708
My child.

23
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,583
Stop! Don't touch my kid!

24
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,625
Crazy bitch, your kids
were burned to death!

25
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:15,875
My child.

26
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,416
Come here, you bitch!

27
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,416
-Damn you, Chaba!
-Take this!

28
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,750
How could you do this to my child?

29
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,291
Die, you bitch!

30
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,958
Pang.

31
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,125
-Do you wanna die?
-Go to hell!

32
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,833
-Go to hell!
-Go to hell!

33
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,083
Look at my face, bitch!

34
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,625
-Kill her!
-Kill her!

35
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,166
-Crazy bitch!
-Let her die!

36
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,375
-Die, you bitch!
-Die!

37
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,083
Go to hell!

38
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,291
-Crazy bitch!
-Crazy!

39
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,333
Just die already!

40
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,375
Die!

41
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,208
Hey, Toh,

42
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,916
why are you sitting here?

43
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,708
You don't want to go back in
to see your work?

44
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,708
I watched it once last night.

45
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,666
So how was it? You don't seem happy.

46
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,250
Yeah.

47
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,833
I'm going to edit the scene
where Chaba was hanged.

48
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,750
Hello. What's up?

49
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,166
Yeah.

50
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,458
Pang!

51
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,875
Pang, what happened?

52
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,708
-What happened, Pang?
-Don't! It's here!

53
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,625
It's here. Chaba is here!

54
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't be scared, Pang.

55
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,666
You just had a bad dream, that's all.

56
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,250
Who is that? Is that you, Toh?

57
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,833
Toh?

58
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,083
A.C. MILAN

59
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,041
Hey, Shane, the reel is running out.

60
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,666
Hey, this is the ghost movie that's going
to show in theaters next week, right?

61
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,125
Where did you get these reels?

62
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,541
The production team
had a private screening.

63
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,916
Is it scary? I really want to see
this movie.

64
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,791
I don't know. I don't like horror movies,

65
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:07,875
so I didn't watch.

66
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,375
You're trying to be cool.
But I know you're too scared to watch it.

67
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,375
It's nothing like that.

68
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,166
I just don't like watching stupid movies.

69
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,250

REVENGEFUL SPIRIT

71
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,083
Is it ready yet?

72
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,291
No, not yet. I just got around to it.

73
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,125
So just swap these reels in for now.

74
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,833
They're outside, waiting for the film.

75
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,750
HAUNTING HELL

76
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,541
Yod,

77
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,958
will we get in trouble for this?

78
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,916
You pussy. It's too late to back out now.

79
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,958
If you want your money now, just say so.

80
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,291
This is your share. Here's half now.

81
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,500
As for the rest,
I'll give it to you later.

REVENGEFUL SPIRIT

83
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,500
Hello, is this Joe?

84
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,166
Tonight, I want in on three matches.

85
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,208
On Calcio.

86
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,208
Okay, yes, Cagliari,

87
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,458
Milan, and Palermo.

88
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,625
Bye, Shane.

89
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,291
Palermo! You idiot, not Palamo Picasso.

90
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,125
Yeah, 1,000 baht.

91
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,166
Yes, 1,000 on all three matches.

92
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,875
Are you leaving now?

93
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:34,833
Hello.

94
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,708
Thanks.

95
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,166
I didn't think you would remember
my birthday.

96
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,750
Yes, okay, bye.

97
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,708
Hey, Som, happy birthday.

98
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,041
Hey!

99
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,958
Hey, am I interrupting something?

100
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,041
Hey, Yod.

101
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,583
What's wrong with you?

102
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,916
REVENGEFUL SPIRIT

103
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,458
Yod!

104
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:50,833
Yod!

105
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,875
Shane!

106
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,791
Shane!

107
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:58,916
Shane!

108
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,208
Hey, Yod!

109
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,500
Oh, Yod!

110
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,000
Yod, are you all right?

111
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,666
It fucking hurts, man.

112
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,750
What happened?

113
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,500
I'm sorry.

114
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,583
Som, did you really have to hit me?

115
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,541
-I didn't know it was you.
-Yod.

116
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,625
I finished everything.

117
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,125
I want some cake.

118
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,458
Can I eat it?

119
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,666
So, I might gain some weight.

120
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,083
I didn't think you would remember
my birthday.

121
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,666
I didn't.

122
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,625
But your guy here did.

123
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,500
-Bottoms up.
-Fill it up.

124
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,125
-Bottoms up.
-Down it.

125
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,166
Hey, try not to drink too much.

126
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,916
You have to work tomorrow.

127
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,125
Som, you're my sister, not my mother.

128
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,791
It's just a little, I will be fine.

129
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,166
All right.

130
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,291
I've got to go now.

131
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,125
Hey, why? What's the hurry?

132
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,333
I won't be able to wake up.

133
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,625
Your choice, man.

134
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,208
A girl like you going back alone,

135
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,750
do take care. It's very dangerous.

136
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,500
I told you to move in with me.

137
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,458
Right.

138
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,375
Yod's room is as dirty as hell.
Who the hell would be able to live in it?

139
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,500
-Where?
-It's extreme.

140
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,500
-Even the rats have to leave.
-You're overexaggerating.

141
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,208
-You can leave now.
-I'm leaving.

142
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,458
-Bye. Be safe.
-See you.

143
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,333
Go!

144
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,291
Go.

145
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,375
Isn't the weather

146
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,333
good tonight?

147
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:56,958
Hey, Som,

148
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,041
-about the watch I took--
-Forget about it.

00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,625
Shane,

151
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,458
you have the worst luck, man.

152
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,833
I really think Som hates your guts.

153
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:51,958
Hey.

154
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,166
Yod.

155
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,750
Yod, are you sure security
is not going to walk in?

156
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,291
Shit, man, you know I got your back.

157
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,291
Don't you need the money
to get Som's watch?

158
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,166
Just hurry and get it done.

159
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:20,958
Die!

160
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,250
Go to hell!

161
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,208
All right, we're now
in the 73rd minute of the match.

162
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,958
A.C. Milan is being attacked
feverishly by Inter Milan.

TAWEESUP PAWNSHOP

164
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,666
Javier Zanetti is now in possession
of the ball in midfield.

165
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,583
ONE WOMAN WATCH

166
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,500
He is swooping to the left

167
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,791
and switching to the right.

168
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,041
He is now passing the ball to the center.

169
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,875
Shane, what are you doing?

170
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,291
Why are you taking my watch?

171
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,625
I just need to borrow it, Som.

172
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:01,958
Are you trading it for drugs again?

173
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,291
-Come on, just for a while.
-You can't have it!

174
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,708
-I'll return it soon.
-Give it back.

175
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:07,916
Give it back.

176
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,083
Let go!

177
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,125
Som...

178
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,291
Inter Milan has the upper hand so far.

179
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:26,000
The ball is kicked off
from A.C. Milan's side.

180
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:29,333
A.C. Milan is mainly playing
from the left wing today.

REVENGEFUL SPIRIT

182

ANNOUNCEMENT: DEAR CUSTOMERS

183
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,166
RECORDING OF MOVIES IN THE CINEMA
IS REGARDED AS PIRACY

184
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,458
Damn it.

185
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,125
Shit.

186
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:35,708
Who is that?

187
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,333
What are you doing?

188
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:45,166
Here? I was looking for my stuff.

189
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,458
I must've dropped something
while I was here yesterday.

190
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,458
Okay, have you seen, Yod?

191
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,666
No. I just came.

192
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,250
Where the heck is he?

193
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,166
Do you have something urgent for him?
If I see him, I will let him know.

194
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:08,333
Yesterday, Yod returned the wrong print.

195
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,833
Now everyone is scrambling to find it.

196
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,041
They are worried that the film
will be pirated.

197
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,416
Som, where are you?

198
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,500
Go get the posters at the entrance for me.

199
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:20,291
Okay, I'm on my way.

200
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,791
Pang, what happened?

201
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,416
No!

202
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,666
No!

203
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:40,208
Are you jacking off?

204
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:41,500
Why is the door locked?

205
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,166
Oh, I accidentally locked it.

206
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:47,500
Dude, do you know the result
of last night's games?

207
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,333
You won all your bets!

208
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,625
A.C. MILAN OVERTHREW INTER

209
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,041
Does your shift end in the afternoon?

210
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,708
-Yes.
-Can you do me a favor?

211
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:56,041
Go collect my winnings for me.

212
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:59,708
Then take my share of the winnings
and this money,

213
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,250
and go redeem my stuff for me.

214
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,416
-I'm leaving then.
-All right.

215
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,500
Don't forget.

216
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,250
Yod!

217
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:13,291
Yod.

218
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:14,916
Yod!

219
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:31,666
Yod.

220
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:47,583
Yod!

221
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,458
Fuck!

222
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:15,458
Hey, Shane,

223
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,333
where is your supervisor?

224
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,500
No one answered when I called.

225
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,416
I really don't know.

226
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,125
The both of you think
you can screw me over?

227
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,416
So, where's that movie

228
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,458
that I asked you to copy?

229
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:36,166
Right now, all the theater staff
are on the lookout.

230
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,500
About the money, I'll find a way
to pay you back.

231
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:43,875
I don't want your money.

232
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:45,958
Find a way to copy that film.

233
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:49,125
I want to sell the pirated DVDs
before the movie release date.

234
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:27,375
Hey, Pom, are you sure that Chaba
was the one who abducted the kids?

235
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,916
I heard Pang's voice coming from in here.

236
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:32,500
Pang!

237
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,916
Pang, wake up!

238
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,208
CALLING YOD

239
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,291
Phong!

240
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,666
What is it, Pom?

241
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,125
Hurry, take her with you and run.

242
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,125
Ghost.

243
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:30,750
Chaba's ghost is back to get revenge.

244
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:32,458
Everyone else is dead.

245
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,000
It's done here.

246
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:36,500
Hurry! Grab your sister. Go, Phong!
Get out of here.

247
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:49,166
Pang!

248
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,625
Pang!

249
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,083

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,958

252
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,500

257
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:49,166
Shit!

258
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,916
Were you on duty yesterday?

259
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,916
Yes, I was.

260
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,458
When you were on your way out,
did you see Yod?

261
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,750
No, I didn't.

262
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,208
Did you see the film then?

263
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:22,750
What film?

264
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,208
The film Revengeful Spirit.

265
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:25,291
No, I didn't.

266
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,791
And do you know where the print
could be sent to?

267
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Hey, Shane.

268
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:42,291
Are you free? Please come and help us
assemble this standee.

269
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:46,291
Let's go.

270
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:56,833
-Som.
-Yeah?

271
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:58,416
Ever since the two of you broke up,

272
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,958
you never thought of talking to him?

273
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:05,416
If I have nothing to talk about,
why should I talk to him?

274
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,583
You knew that Shane was high on drugs.

275
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,500
He didn't mean to hurt you.

276
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,708
Who knows,

277
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:16,875
one day, he might not be there anymore,
and you're going to regret it.

278
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,291
BASED ON A HORRIFYING TRUE STORY

279
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,791
No!

280
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,166
No!

281
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,166
-No!
-Pang!

282
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,041
Pang, what happened?

283
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:56,541
Pang!

284
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,083
Why are you doing this?

285
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,000
Do you want to go to jail?

286
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:10,791
Don't tell me that you need
the money for drugs.

287
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:15,958
Is Yod part of this, too? Where is he?

288
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,250
Where is Yod?

289
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:24,083
Yod, he is...

290
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:26,916
Yod is dead, Som.

291
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:29,083
What are you talking about?

292
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:33,291
This might sound ridiculous.

293
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,500
But this movie,

294
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,625
there's something about it.

295
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:43,333
The ghost in the movie,
I think she is for real.

296
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,166
Shane, are you high?

297
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:48,666
No, Som.

298
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,250
Som, take a look at this.

299
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,083
No!

300
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,333
Last night,

301
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:04,041
-No!
-I was screening the movie again,

302
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,458
and...

303
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:08,541
I noticed Yod's corpse in the movie.

304
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:11,250
In the movie?

305
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,916
Ever since I've watched this movie,

306
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,041
I've been seeing her all the time.

307
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,375
Don't watch the movie,
or else you will end up like me!

308
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:35,333
Why? If I want to watch it,

309
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,125
what are you going to do? Hit me?

310
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:54,708
Thanks.

are you sitting here for?

316
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,916
I thought you already went home.

317
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,083
Here is the stuff you asked me
to get for you.

318
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:00,250
Luckily, I redeemed it on time,
or else it might have been sold.

319
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:41,375
Hey!

320
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:46,375
Hey!

321
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:48,333
Open it!

322
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,250
Help, please!

323
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,625
Fucking open it!

324
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:22,416
-Hey.
-Hey, Shane!

325
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,583
Shane, what's wrong?

326
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:26,125
Shane!

327
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,791
Shane! Could you help me out here?

328
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:28,833
Shane!

329
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:30,416
Hey!

330
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:32,708
Shane, what's wrong?

331
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,291
What the hell is going on?

332
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:45,958
I have no clue what's scaring the shit
out of him.

333
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,291
But this time, I think he's really
in bad shape.

334
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,333
What else could be causing this?

335
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:56,333
Except for him getting high
and overdosing again?

00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:59,125
Som, you know what?
Ever since you broke up,

337
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:01,250
he stopped using drugs.

338
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,041
-See you tomorrow, Som.
-All right.

339
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:08,708
-Bye.
-Bye, Som.

357
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,083
Thank you

358
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:03,750
for taking care of me, Som.

359
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,208
Shane,

360
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,291
you know that story you told me...

361
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,041
about Yod

362
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,166
and the ghost in the movie?

363
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:27,291
At first, I wasn't sure if it was true.

364
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:29,583
But...

365
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:32,041
I came across what you told me
on the Internet.

366
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:34,416
It was exactly as you told me.

367
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:41,333
If everything that's been happening
to you is exactly like the movie,

368
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:43,583
then how will the movie end?

369
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:49,875
In the end,

370
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:55,333
the hero dies.

371
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:58,375
He breaks into an abandoned house

372
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:00,375
to find and burn Chaba's body.

373
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,625
But he doesn't make it.

374
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,125
What if...

375
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,416
we can make it?

376
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:18,791
Chaba's body might still be in this house.

377
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:22,458
AFTER CHABA'S BODY WAS HANGED,

378
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:26,541
UNTIL NOW, HER BODY
STILL HASN'T BEEN FOUND.

Look!

382
00:52:51,916 --> 00:52:52,958
This can't be it.

383
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,916
There should be another room here.

384
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:03,083
Shane, everything might not be exactly
like the movie.

385
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:04,833
-Som!
-Shit!

386
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:09,166

387
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:10,625
Shane!

388
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,625
How are you, Shane?

389
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:15,791
Shane!

390
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:18,625
Can you hear me?

391
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,416
Shane!

392
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:28,708
Shane!

393
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:35,166
Shane, I'll be back in a moment.

394
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:08,791
Shane, are you all right? Are you hurt?

395
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:11,541
I'm all right.

396
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:13,666
Let's get out of here.

397
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:16,416
Shane!

398
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:21,333
Shane. Come up, quickly!

399
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:23,708
Shane, what's wrong?

400
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:26,500
Shane, what's wrong?

401
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:27,708
Come with me.

402
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,833
I'm telling you to come with me!

403
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:35,291
Come with me!

404
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:38,916
Shane!

405
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:44,583
Shane, I'm telling you to come with me!

406
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:48,500
Shane, come here!

407
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:53,416
-Get lost!
-Shane!

408
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:58,041
Shane, it's me.

409
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:00,833
It's all right.

410
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,041
Shane, it's me.

411
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:30,208
I will end up like Yod.

412
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:43,166
Som, I brought your watch back.

413
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:47,625
But I accidentally broke it again.

414
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:57,458
I don't think I can fix it
for you this time.

415
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,916
Shane, don't talk like that.

416
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,875
You're going to be all right.

417
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:19,333
Mr. Rashane, please go
to the examination room.

418
00:57:21,666 --> 00:57:23,958
From what I can see,
you have a fracture in your left arm.

419
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,750
I will give you some medicine
for the pain,

420
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:28,375
then you can go home.

421
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:35,291
So, what were the two of you doing
in that house?

422
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:42,416
We were looking for more information

423
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:46,750
to do a news story about Chaba's death.

424
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:52,291
What are you talking about?

425
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:54,500
Chaba is not dead.

426
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,583
Doctor, what do you mean?

427
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:00,541
PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY

428
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:03,250
Right after Chaba was taken
by the villagers to be hanged,

429
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:06,916
the police arrived just in time to send
her to the hospital and saved her life.

430
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:09,583
However, all the villagers
believed she died.

431
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:11,541
So the story was forgotten.

432
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:14,583
There. That is Chaba.

433
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:21,875
Are you sure that old lady
is really Chaba?

434
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:23,250
Yes, I'm sure.

435
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:29,375
So if Chaba is not dead,

436
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,125
then...

00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,125
Who is she?

440
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:40,583
Is it possible

441
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,750
that everything is just a figment
of your imagination?

-Okay.
-Move towards the end a little.

01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:33,583

-Kill her!

-Kill her!

490
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,458

01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:50,083
Hey! Help me. I can't take it anymore.

Hey, your foot position is wrong.

-You know what I mean?
-Okay.

498

What are you afraid of?
You're tensing all the wrong body parts.

499
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:10,166
I don't know. It's just...

you looked like you were dancing,

01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:19,541
Action!

503
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,000
-Pull the rope!
-Go to hell!

504
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,000
Cut!

505
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:24,625
You don't even have any lines.

506
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:27,291
All you have to do is act
like you're dying. You can't do it?

507
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,541
Action.

508
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:34,875
-That's right! Pull the rope!
-Kill her!

509
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:36,291
-Hey!
-Cut!

510
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:39,041
-Damn it!
-You can do better.

511
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:47,041
Damn, why is it so difficult?

512
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:49,083
Can we try it again, one more time?

513
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:56,541
If she can't get it this time, then Jeab,
you go change and take her place instead.

514
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,708
What are you scared of? I don't get it!

515
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:01,791
What's not safe? See? It's safe. Okay?

516
01:04:03,166 --> 01:04:05,958
How many times are you going
to repeat the same mistake?

517
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,916
Everybody is waiting for you.

518
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:09,750
Can we film already? Damn it!

519
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,000
We're ready.

520
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:13,541
Okay, ready, everyone?
Just one more time, okay?

521
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:17,416
Get out of my way!

522
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,750
Help! Help!

523
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,166
What the hell? Fuck.

524
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,250
Hey, Jeab.

525
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,541
Jeab, come have a look.

526
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:04,833
-Come have a look.
-What?

527
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:06,375
-Come and see!
-Shit.

528
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:08,250
-Look, the sling's broken.
-Holy shit.

529
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,291
Oh, damn! Stop! Everybody stop!

530
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:12,416
-The sling broke. Toh, the sling broke!
-What the fuck?

531
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,375
Get her down. Get her down first!

532
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:15,916
Cut! Get her down, quickly!

533
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,625
-Come on help her down.
-Get her down.

534
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:19,583
-Quickly!
-Toh, get her down first!

535
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:23,250
Get her down first! Shit!

536
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,583
It's okay. Don't die!

537
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,916
Is she okay?

538
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:54,708
Sorry--

539
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:08,791
Shane!

540
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,958
Shane, where are you going?

541
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:16,250
Som,

542
01:06:16,916 --> 01:06:18,458
if I don't make it back tomorrow,

543
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:20,833
please don't go to the theater.

544
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:23,166
Don't watch the movie.

545
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:25,541
Why?

546
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:32,916
The scene where Chaba died
in the movie is for real.

547
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,791
Ingchan's death was for real.

548
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:40,541
And whoever watches that scene...

549
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,208
will die.

550
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:47,666
Shane, what are you going to do?

551
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,583
Where are you going?

552
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:08,166
Shane!

553
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,291
Shane!

554
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,125
I'm sorry, Som.

555
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,625
Shane!

556
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:20,125
Shane!

557
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:23,000
Shane!

558
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:40,333
Hey, Shane.

559
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,291
Keeping to yourself lately?

560
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:45,208
Where are you going in such a hurry?

561
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,541
I've been waiting for you for many days.

562
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:50,583
Don't tell me you're going to try
to skip out on me again?

563
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,958
The exit is to your right.

564
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:56,875
Yeah, the movie just ended.

565
01:07:57,458 --> 01:07:59,208
I'm leaving now.

566

REVENGEFUL SPIRIT

567
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,500
Hey, Shane.

568
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,458
Keeping to yourself lately?

569
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:48,166
Where are you going in such a hurry?

570
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,541
I've been waiting for you for many days.

571
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,875
Don't tell me you're going to try
to skip out on me again?

572
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:56,583
The exit is to your right.

573
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:58,791
Yeah, the movie just ended.

574
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:00,500
I'm leaving now.

575
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:13,333
REVENGEFUL SPIRIT

576
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:52,541
Hey, Shane.

577
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:54,375
Keeping to yourself lately?

578
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:57,250
Where are you going in such a hurry?

579
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:00,041
I've been waiting for you for many days.

580
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:02,291
Don't tell me you're going to try
to skip out on me again?

581
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:15,000
Shithead!

582
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:45,125
What the fuck!

583
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:45,833
Som!

584
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:49,750
Som!

585
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,916
Som!

586
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:02,208
Shane!

587
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,666
Shane?

588
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,500
Shane!

589
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:11,000
Shane!

590
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,208
Som!

591
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:27,666
Som!

592
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,125
Som.

593
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:24,833
You really want to see me die?

594
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:27,125
Look at me!

595
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,166
You really want to see me die?

596
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:32,041
Do you really want to see?

597
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:41,875
Shit!

598
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:41,291
Shane!

599
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:47,291
Shane!

600
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:14,500
Yod.

601
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,208
Shane.

602
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:43,083
Shane!

603
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:46,416
Shane!

604
01:15:47,916 --> 01:15:49,125
Shane!

605
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:03,625
Shane!

606
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:44,250
RESENTMENT NEVER DIES

Dear customers who are here for the film
Revengeful Spirit, you can catch it

01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:10,666
The movie is about to start.

612
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,125
Do you really wanna see me die?
