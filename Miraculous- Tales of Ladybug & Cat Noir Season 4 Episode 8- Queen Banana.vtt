I'll bet you
it's a tablecloth for a picnic!

00:33.560 --> 00:36.080
Not even close, Xuppu!
It's a cape.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.400
For the Superhero of Creation

00:38.400 --> 00:40.440
and for
the Supervillain of Destruction!

00:40.440 --> 00:43.040
‐ For Cat Noir and Ladybug?
‐ No, it's for a movie!

00:43.520 --> 00:45.560
‐ Oh!
‐ You know,

00:45.560 --> 00:48.480
‐ those stories they show on TV?
‐ Are you gonna be famous?

00:48.480 --> 00:51.280
No, I'm the costume designer.
I'm not acting in it.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.160
But we are gonna be on the news.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.720
I'm gonna be late!

00:55.720 --> 00:57.680
<i>And now,
a very original project</i>

00:57.680 --> 01:00.440
<i>coming from the François Dupont
School in Paris.</i>

01:00.440 --> 01:02.120
<i>Clara Contard, reporting.</i>

01:02.120 --> 01:04.200
<i>Under the initiative
of the art teacher,</i>

01:04.200 --> 01:07.240
<i>one of François Dupont School's
alumni, Thomas Astruc,</i>

01:07.240 --> 01:08.760
<i>a successful film director,</i>

01:08.760 --> 01:10.720
<i>is participating
in an ambitious project.</i>

01:10.720 --> 01:12.520
<i>He's overseeing these students,</i>

01:12.520 --> 01:14.480
<i>who are volunteering
their time off,</i>

01:14.480 --> 01:17.640
<i>to produce a real live movie
from script to storyboard,</i>

01:17.640 --> 01:20.680
<i>to costumes, everything's being
done by the students themselves</i>

01:20.680 --> 01:23.040
<i>with financial support
from City Hall.</i>

01:23.040 --> 01:26.080
<i>Yes, well, you know, I myself
directed a film in my youth.</i>

01:26.080 --> 01:28.720
<i>The cherry on top is
that the film will be released</i>

01:28.720 --> 01:31.760
<i>in select movie theatres, thank
to famous producer Bob Roth.</i>

01:31.760 --> 01:34.040
<i>What a lucky break
for these students</i>

01:34.040 --> 01:36.640
<i>as well as for the actresses
who'll be starring in it.</i>

01:36.640 --> 01:39.200
<i>You may hate me,
but I love you.</i>

01:39.200 --> 01:40.840
<i>And I'll always will.</i>

01:41.240 --> 01:44.480
A film with my half‐of‐a‐sister
as the star? Ridiculous!

01:44.480 --> 01:47.360
Do you want another banana?
They help better one's mood.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.920
What I want is to go tell
that bunch of lame‐os

01:49.920 --> 01:51.680
how things work in real life.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.240
In my life!

01:53.240 --> 01:55.520
You may hate me,
but I love you.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.600
‐ And I always will.
‐ How dare you all?

01:58.600 --> 02:00.800
Giving the role
to my half‐of‐a‐sister,

02:00.800 --> 02:02.280
who just came out of nowhere?

02:02.280 --> 02:04.160
And with Daddy's money
on top of it all!

02:04.160 --> 02:06.600
It's not actually funded by me,
but by the city.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.240
Same thing!

02:08.600 --> 02:10.520
You! I told you that you'd be
sent back to New York

02:10.520 --> 02:13.040
if you ever crossed my path.
Not only you're on my path,

02:13.040 --> 02:15.040
but on TV, too!

02:15.040 --> 02:17.520
Don't let your sister
walk all over you, Zoé.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.720
You were made for this part.
You deserve it.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.280
True. We're meeting with
the producer tomorrow,

02:22.280 --> 02:24.080
so it's too late
to change anything.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.320
Might I remind you
that you were offered the chance

02:27.320 --> 02:30.240
to participate in the film,
but you refused because,

02:30.240 --> 02:33.440
"Mylene's sweater is too ugly,
Nath draws like a child,

02:33.440 --> 02:36.800
Alya is useless and Marinette is
ridiculous, utterly ridiculous."

02:36.800 --> 02:38.920
‐ I said that?
‐ Less politely.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.960
Well, I still mean all of it.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.680
But if this stupid, childish
film actually gets released

02:43.680 --> 02:45.880
in theatres
and turns someone into a star,

02:45.880 --> 02:47.720
that someone should be me!

02:47.720 --> 02:50.280
So you'll give me the part
she's playing

02:50.280 --> 02:52.640
because everything she owns is mine!

02:52.640 --> 02:55.400
‐ Hmm!
‐ Banana, Chloé?

02:57.080 --> 02:58.480
Don't worry. I'll talk to her.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.200
Everything will be fine tomorrow.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.520
And here's the office
of the producer, Bob Roth.

03:05.520 --> 03:08.840
‐ Surprise!
‐

03:08.840 --> 03:10.960
Chloé? What are you doing here?

03:10.960 --> 03:15.080
My old friend André told me
you'd be OK making small changes

03:15.080 --> 03:17.960
‐ so Chloé could be in the film.
‐ But it's impossible!

03:17.960 --> 03:20.520
‐ We've gotten everything set!
‐ Moviemaking, kid,

03:20.520 --> 03:22.320
is the art of compromise.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.280
To protect your...
the interests of the film,

03:24.280 --> 03:26.320
you gotta be flexible.

03:26.320 --> 03:28.240
So André's daughter
will play the starring role.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.080
That's not good for the film!

03:30.080 --> 03:32.920
Zoé is perfect for the role!

03:32.920 --> 03:35.400
The next plane for New York
leaves in 30 minutes.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.520
‐ Grr!
‐ No big deal

03:37.520 --> 03:39.000
if I don't play the main role.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.800
There're lots
of other positions.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.080
Perfect! As long as she's not
on screen, it's fine with me.

03:44.080 --> 03:47.080
Then it's a deal! See you all
tomorrow morning on set!

03:47.080 --> 03:48.760
‐ Bye‐bye, losers!
‐ Now, get out!

03:50.000 --> 03:51.680
This is totally unfair!

03:55.360 --> 03:58.000
Believe it or not,
I also shot a film in my youth.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.640
It was called... <i>Solitude!</i>

03:59.640 --> 04:02.080
Daddy,
I'm trying to concentrate here!

04:02.080 --> 04:04.600
‐ Of course. Sorry, sweetheart.
‐ And you, Dupain‐Cheng,

04:04.600 --> 04:06.880
cool it with
the horrible costume. It's lame!

04:06.880 --> 04:09.520
That's why it suits you so well,
Chloé!

04:10.200 --> 04:13.320
Oh! Uh...

04:13.320 --> 04:16.800
Here, the population has been
put into an enchanted sleep,

04:16.800 --> 04:19.800
so we need tons of extras.
You are gonna lay down here...

04:19.800 --> 04:21.640
Wait for me!

04:24.280 --> 04:25.600
‐ Perfect!
‐ Hey! All of you!

04:26.320 --> 04:29.360
Someone just told me I'm
the Supervillain of Destruction

04:29.360 --> 04:32.040
and Mylène is the Superhero
of Creation! Are you kidding me?

04:32.040 --> 04:34.440
I get the lead role.
I am the good guy, OK?

04:34.440 --> 04:36.360
The two roles
are both important.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.840
Blah, blah, blah! I don't care!
I get to be the good guy!

04:38.840 --> 04:40.960
We don't have time for
all of these changes, Chloé!

04:40.960 --> 04:44.000
‐ Oh, yeah? Daddy!
‐

04:44.880 --> 04:49.480
It's common to have to adapt
a script at the last minute ‐‐

04:49.480 --> 04:52.760
That's baloney! A waste of time?
Giving up on your dreams?

04:52.760 --> 04:55.160
‐ A revision.
‐ It's for the good of the film.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.320
Scene nine. Take one. Action!

05:02.240 --> 05:06.320
‐ You're meant to be acting!
‐ Lame... boring... dull!

05:06.320 --> 05:10.280
What we need is a superhero film
featuring a <i>real</i> superhero!

05:10.280 --> 05:13.640
Hey! What's black and yellow,
has pretty blonde hair,

05:13.640 --> 05:16.760
gets everyone's attention and is
gonna break the box office?

05:17.600 --> 05:19.640
You're not talking about you
as Queen Bee?

05:19.640 --> 05:21.880
'Cause, mostly,
you were a super‐disaster

05:21.880 --> 05:23.000
more than superhero!

05:23.600 --> 05:25.760
Uh, actually I wasn't
even thinking of Queen Bee!

05:25.760 --> 05:28.280
I was thinking of
a much more original character.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.880
Queen... uh... Queen Banana!

05:32.560 --> 05:34.000
‐
‐ Queen what?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.040
‐ Daddy!
‐

05:38.360 --> 05:40.720
Scene nine, take two. Action!

05:40.720 --> 05:42.840
<i>Ah! This is way better</i>

05:42.840 --> 05:45.080
<i>than that ridiculous costume
Dupain‐Cheng made!</i>

05:45.080 --> 05:49.360
<i>But it's missing something.
I know! I need wheels!</i>

05:49.880 --> 05:52.320
You don't need a car,
these superheroes can fly!

05:52.720 --> 05:55.280
What do you know about
superheroes, Baker Girl?

05:55.280 --> 05:58.400
Just go back to sleep
while I... Daddy!

06:00.920 --> 06:03.240
Scene nine, take three. Action!

06:03.240 --> 06:04.760
<i>Ha! We can start now.</i>

06:06.360 --> 06:09.080
Except... when she sees you
just lying around doing nothing,

06:09.080 --> 06:10.960
She doesn't feel like
saving you.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.440
She feels more like
tossing you in the garbage!

06:13.440 --> 06:15.920
Chloé, we're not changing
everything again!

06:15.920 --> 06:19.720
Who said change everything?
We just need a better challenge!

06:19.720 --> 06:21.600
‐ Daddy!
‐

06:23.080 --> 06:25.320
Thanks, Adrien!
It's really gorgeous of you,

06:25.320 --> 06:27.920
I mean, generous of you
to come help us.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.320
Happy to. My father said
it was for the good of the film.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.040
At least <i>he</i> is worth saving!

06:36.040 --> 06:39.720
‐ OK, now can we shoot?
‐ Hmm. We need a new bad guy!

06:39.720 --> 06:42.320
‐ A super‐duper uber villain.
‐ Argh!

06:42.880 --> 06:44.960
A galactic emperor?

06:44.960 --> 06:47.600
A giant octopus
that comes from outer space?

06:47.600 --> 06:50.960
‐ A fire‐breathing dragon?
‐ No, no, those are so lame!

06:50.960 --> 06:54.000
I want a giant yellow gorilla
that throws exploding bananas!

06:55.080 --> 06:57.400
It's for the good of the film.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.000
Are you kidding? I want a <i>real</i>
dynamite‐slinging gorilla!

07:02.240 --> 07:05.480
‐ Not some cardboard monkey!
‐ But giant, yellow

07:05.480 --> 07:07.800
dynamite‐slinging apes
do not exist!

07:07.800 --> 07:10.640
There are tons of giant gorillas
doing stuff in the good movies!

07:10.640 --> 07:12.000
Can't you hire one of those?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.920
I'm so tired of all of you.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.880
I'm getting some beauty rest!

07:15.880 --> 07:18.480
Tomorrow you'd better have this
monkey business figured out!

07:22.240 --> 07:25.080
Maybe the zoo will lend us an
ape if we take good care of it?

07:25.080 --> 07:28.240
You're not really gonna look
for a dynamite‐slinging gorilla?

07:28.240 --> 07:31.680
‐ It's for the good of the film.
‐ It's not!

07:31.680 --> 07:34.040
It's not even a film any more,
just Chloé's fantasy.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.480
The only thing we'll do now
is get Adrien out of that cage.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.720
Then we'll shoot
what we thought up together.

07:39.720 --> 07:43.440
‐ For the good of the film!
‐

07:54.600 --> 07:57.360
Where's my giant gorilla?
Where are all the others?

07:57.360 --> 07:59.600
Why isn't anyone here
to shoot my big scene?

07:59.600 --> 08:00.840
They shot everything last night.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.200
They're probably screening it.

08:06.120 --> 08:06.800
What the... ?

08:10.080 --> 08:11.840
‐ Ultimate Nightmare!
‐ Harmonic Wind!

08:21.960 --> 08:24.920
‐
‐ Huh?

08:29.280 --> 08:30.000
Aw!

08:33.320 --> 08:35.240
I free you from evil!

08:36.400 --> 08:38.000
Why did you awaken them,
Kreatika?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.840
Humans have destroyed
the planet!

08:39.840 --> 08:41.280
They don't deserve to be awake!

08:42.640 --> 08:45.200
You're wrong, Destroika.
Each one of those humans

08:45.200 --> 08:47.040
carries the hope
of a better world within them.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.880
You're just like them!
I hate you!

08:50.280 --> 08:52.520
You may hate me, but I love you.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.080
And I always will even
if the whole world hates you...

08:55.640 --> 08:57.800
‐ Sister!
‐

09:05.120 --> 09:06.520
This is ridiculous!

09:07.040 --> 09:09.320
Who authorised shooting this?
Where's my monkey?

09:09.320 --> 09:12.200
And what is my half‐of‐a sister
doing in my movie?

09:12.200 --> 09:15.080
<i>Miss Dupain‐Cheng convinced me
to watch this first scene.</i>

09:15.080 --> 09:18.000
<i>I found it very moving and
Adrien is exceptional in it.</i>

09:18.000 --> 09:22.040
<i>So I'll finance the movie based
on the original screenplay.</i>

09:22.040 --> 09:24.760
‐ Daddy!
‐ Like we said before, kid,

09:24.760 --> 09:26.880
movie‐making's
all about compromise.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.160
Sorry, Chloé, it was
for the good of the film.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.520
Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!

09:33.520 --> 09:36.160
But most of all,
it's for the good of my plan.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.000
Chloé is always an excellent
source of inspiration.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.840
Nooroo, Duusuu... unify!

09:57.400 --> 09:59.720
‐ Hey! Wait!
‐ Adrikins!

09:59.720 --> 10:02.520
It's sweet of you to want
to console me, but I'm fine.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.320
I'm going to get my revenge
and send Zoé back to New York.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.160
Actually, I came to suggest
you apologise to everyone.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.120
Are you ill?
They've ruined my film!

10:11.120 --> 10:13.880
It was never your film, Chloé.
It belonged to the group.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.440
You promised me you'd stop
being mean to everyone.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.080
I warned you that if you didn't,
we could no longer be friends.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.240
You're as ridiculous
as that film! It's over!

10:22.240 --> 10:25.040
You're no longer my Adrikins.
You're Adri‐nothing!

10:35.880 --> 10:39.000
Queen Banana, I am Shadow Moth.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.400
Once again they refuse
to recognise your true talent.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.040
So I give you the power
to show them

10:44.040 --> 10:46.680
who the <i>real</i> star of Paris is.

10:46.680 --> 10:50.040
Fine, but I want a giant monkey
who throws exploding bananas!

10:50.440 --> 10:54.080
It's all arranged. I am
the director of your dreams.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.800
‐ In exchange for your powers ‐‐
‐ Yeah, yeah, I know!

10:56.800 --> 10:59.320
Ladybug and Cat Noir's
Miraculous! You'll have them!

11:09.040 --> 11:11.760
‐ Aaah!
‐

11:15.400 --> 11:18.400
‐ Banana Boomboom... Action!
‐ Roar!

11:25.840 --> 11:28.360
Where is my useless
half‐of‐a sister?

11:28.360 --> 11:30.440
Banana Boomboom! Peel them off!

11:39.480 --> 11:41.200
Plagg, claws out!

11:42.520 --> 11:45.240
She's mad at me, so I should try
and reason with her!

11:45.240 --> 11:48.080
Unfortunately, no one can
reason with her. Stay here.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.240
I'm gonna...
try to find a way out.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.920
Aaah!

11:55.840 --> 11:57.840
Tikki, spots on!

11:57.840 --> 11:58.800
Yeah!

12:12.280 --> 12:13.640
Aaah!

12:14.960 --> 12:17.320
If you don't come out
from your hiding place, Zoé,

12:17.320 --> 12:19.920
I'll turn all of Paris
into bananas.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.480
And it'll be all your fault!

12:22.480 --> 12:23.520
My fault?

12:28.880 --> 12:31.600
Hey, there Banana Queen!
So what's your superpower?

12:31.600 --> 12:33.600
Making people
slip on banana peels?

12:33.600 --> 12:36.520
You're about to find out,
you ridiculous alley cat!

12:49.680 --> 12:52.360
Careful! Shadow Moth has been
very generous to Chloé.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.680
I <i>am</i> a little jealous
of her gear!

12:54.440 --> 12:57.160
Totally unnecessary. Nothing
can beat a cat and ladybug duo.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.880
Miaow! We do make
the perfect pair, Milady!

13:12.840 --> 13:13.920
Well, we've got gear, too!

13:14.760 --> 13:16.280
Lucky charm!

13:23.160 --> 13:25.360
Scooter, helmets...

13:25.360 --> 13:27.200
Tube of glue, cartridges,
air pipe...

13:27.600 --> 13:29.240
Everything needed
to fix a flat tyre.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.000
That's a lot to process!

13:35.400 --> 13:37.760
Still, something is missing...
but what?

13:37.760 --> 13:40.640
Hey! Chloé, here I am!

13:41.080 --> 13:42.520
Of course! Zoé!

13:43.400 --> 13:46.400
Ready for a transatlantic voyage
on the Banana Express?

13:46.400 --> 13:49.120
Only if you promise
to stop doing evil in Paris.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.040
Of course,
I promise I'll be really good!

13:54.160 --> 13:56.840
You'll never keep your promise!

13:56.840 --> 14:01.200
Of course not! Bananahead!
Banana‐boomboom! Grab her!

14:04.440 --> 14:06.320
Cat Noir! Cover us!

14:06.320 --> 14:07.440
Cataclysm!

14:13.240 --> 14:14.200
‐
‐ Oops!

14:18.600 --> 14:21.120
When he's out of control,

14:21.120 --> 14:25.400
Banana‐boomboom is even more
destructive! Have fun, you two!

14:26.400 --> 14:27.200
Hang on tight!

14:39.880 --> 14:42.200
You'll have to come out
sometime, Ladybug.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.240
Especially if you don't want
to see my monkey

14:44.240 --> 14:47.680
make a banana smoothie
outta your kitty! Ha, ha, ha!

14:50.080 --> 14:52.320
We don't have much time.
I need your help to save

14:52.320 --> 14:53.600
Cat Noir and Chloé.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.400
‐ Me? Help you?
‐ Here is the bee Miraculous,

14:58.400 --> 15:01.040
which lets you
immobilise your opponent.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.680
You will use it
for the greater good.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.320
At your service, my queen.

15:07.720 --> 15:11.080
But Chloé's going to be furious!
She used to be Queen Bee!

15:11.080 --> 15:12.640
Chloé will never know it's you.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.640
You'll keep your identity
a secret,

15:14.640 --> 15:18.240
and once the job is complete,
you will return the Miraculous.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.800
I can't do it.
I'm not strong enough. I...

15:21.800 --> 15:23.080
I know you can do this.

15:25.320 --> 15:28.840
You have only one thing to say,
my queen. Pollen, buzz on!

15:32.800 --> 15:34.760
Pollen, buzz on!

16:03.360 --> 16:05.200
Yoohoo!

16:13.360 --> 16:16.640
Hey, you big ape! How about
fighting someone your own size?

16:17.720 --> 16:18.680
Venom!

16:23.800 --> 16:25.600
Aaah!

16:41.280 --> 16:45.000
‐ Queen Bee?
‐ No! My name's Vesperia!

16:45.400 --> 16:48.600
‐ Wow!
‐ Ladybug's gonna need us again!

16:48.600 --> 16:50.640
Thrilled to make
your acquaintance.

16:50.640 --> 16:51.960
Just give me a second.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.680
That Vesperia is to Queen Bee

16:57.680 --> 16:59.920
what Fourme d'Ambert
is to Roquefort,

16:59.920 --> 17:02.600
sweeter, more refined
and much nicer!

17:13.200 --> 17:15.000
Aaah!

17:15.000 --> 17:18.320
I'm going to smash you up
and turn you into banana bread!

17:18.320 --> 17:19.920
Cataclysm!

17:25.120 --> 17:28.760
Give me your Miraculous, or else
I'll turn her into baby food!

17:28.760 --> 17:31.680
Queen Banana! You're not even
capable of a fair fight

17:31.680 --> 17:34.040
with the new holder
of the Bee Miraculous!

17:34.040 --> 17:37.920
How dare you?
I'm the one and only Queen Bee!

17:37.920 --> 17:41.480
Oh, you were! But I am
the real Queen Bee now.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.320
And you're only
the queen of bananas!

17:44.320 --> 17:47.680
Ladybug chose me to defend Paris
because you couldn't do it.

17:50.920 --> 17:54.760
Ha, ha! And what'll you defend
now that you're a banana?

17:55.200 --> 17:58.920
Now see what happens to people
who don't see things my way?

17:58.920 --> 18:00.680
Give me your Miraculous!

18:00.680 --> 18:02.400
Huh?

18:02.400 --> 18:04.640
This lucky‐charm glue
is really good!

18:04.640 --> 18:06.800
And so is Vesperia,
don't you think, Cat Noir?

18:06.800 --> 18:09.320
You counted your bananas before
they were peeled, Queen Banana.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.160
No! Not again!

18:13.720 --> 18:15.160
Aaah!

18:22.480 --> 18:24.400
No more evil‐doing for you,
little akuma.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.280
Time to de‐evilise!

18:34.120 --> 18:34.760
Gotcha!

18:35.880 --> 18:38.240
Bye‐bye, little butterfly!
Bye, little feather!

18:38.240 --> 18:40.640
Miraculous Ladybug!

18:53.280 --> 18:54.560
Pound it!

18:54.560 --> 18:56.160
I hate you, Ladybug!

18:56.720 --> 18:59.280
And you, Vesperia, you're only
a fake version of Queen Bee!

18:59.280 --> 19:00.880
You need to learn
to control your anger.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.840
There is a way I could help you.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.320
I don't want anything from you!
You're non‐existent!

19:12.320 --> 19:13.760
You're Lady‐Nothing‐At‐All!

19:15.600 --> 19:18.200
Queen Banana's film
has turned out to be a flop.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.680
But the script
will be rewritten very soon.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.200
Chloé,
your endless supply of anger

19:24.200 --> 19:26.400
promises multitudes of chaos.

19:26.400 --> 19:30.080
Sooner or later, I'll get
my hands on those Miraculous!

19:32.080 --> 19:34.240
Better recharge our kwamis
before Shadow Moth

19:34.240 --> 19:36.960
akumatises her again.
Vesperia, Milady.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.960
This Magical Charm could help
Chloé escape his influence.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.440
But I can't
force her to wear it.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.920
I know how to do it.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.080
I want to shoot <i>my</i> film!

19:52.080 --> 19:53.880
That's enough, Chloé.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.960
It doesn't matter if you try
to send me to New York.

19:55.960 --> 19:59.560
I'm done playing the supporting
role for the good of our family.

19:59.560 --> 20:03.000
‐ Daddy!
‐ Zoé is right, Chloé.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.760
You can ask me
for a new cell phone

20:04.760 --> 20:06.400
or to paint the limousine pink,

20:06.400 --> 20:08.720
but you can't ask me
to hurt your sister.

20:08.720 --> 20:12.080
Don't call her that!
She's nothing to me!

20:12.080 --> 20:14.320
I... I hate you!

20:14.320 --> 20:17.440
You may hate me,
but I love you.

20:17.440 --> 20:21.880
And I always will even if the
whole world hates you... sister!

20:22.840 --> 20:26.440
Remember?
We have the same mother!

20:26.440 --> 20:28.920
Look,
she even gave me this gift.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.200
If it comes from Mom, then
I'm the one who gets to wear it.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.760
Give it to me!

20:33.800 --> 20:37.640
What's mine is yours.
You and I are family.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.120
‐ It works!
‐ That's impossible!

20:43.120 --> 20:45.760
‐ What's going on?
‐ You just wait!

20:45.760 --> 20:48.160
Real life is nothing like
your stupid film.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.680
I'll get my revenge!

20:52.160 --> 20:55.520
‐ Chloé? You OK?
‐ Leave me alone, all of you!

20:58.920 --> 21:01.480
‐ Zoé did it.
‐ Maybe this will help Chloé

21:01.480 --> 21:04.400
‐ become a better person.
‐ Let's hope so, Tikki.
