1
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,916
Being able to fix
what seems like junk to everyone

2
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,250
and being able to make things
functional again

3
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,166
always make Jock happy.

4
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,791
A TV Fan.

5
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,416
You won't feel hot
while watching TV again.

6
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,583
Though things might be
a little unconventional.

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,833
You freak.

8
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,208
Go to hell.

9
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,291
Go.

10
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,916
Even when his life isn't going well,

11
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,583
he is still happy to try and fix things.

12
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,875
LOAN CONTRACT

13
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,041
MANA

14
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,750
So he does his mission with confidence.

15
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,333
You're on the right track, Jock!

16
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,333
SOLAR CELL BBQ PORK

17
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,541
-Move to the left.
-A little more.

18
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,208
Yes, that's it.

19
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,875
Hey, everyone! Look!

20
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,916
I'm too good.

21
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,583
But his confidence is sometimes useless.

22
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:50,708
I'm damn proud of myself.

23
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,666
Because there is a part of life
that is inevitably attached to...

24
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,458
destiny.

25
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,541
CLOSED FOR GOOD

26
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:06,958
One day, destiny brought Jock
to a turning point.

27
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,041
THE BEDSIDE DETECTIVE

28
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:16,458
THE JOURNAL OF THE TRUE ENCOUNTERS
OF A PRIVATE DETECTIVE

29
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,000
URGENT! DETECTIVE WANTED!

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,833
-Hey! You lowlife!
-What the hell is that?

31
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,041
Hey!

32
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,583
Although it's a risky job,

33
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,250
the compensation puts a smile on his face.

34
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,208
And because of his innate talent
as an inventor,

35
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,708
Jock became a detective

36
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,791
while repairing things on the side.

37
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:01,875
-Jock.
-Yes?

38
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,250
Can you fix my TV?

39
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,375
He has Rue-Tai,

40
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,041
a karaoke girl next door,

41
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,500
to take care of him.

42
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,333
Thanks, Rue-Tai. You smooth it out.

43
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,208
Ironing clothes is a piece of cake.

44
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,333
My mom taught me

45
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,833
that a woman is considered a good wife

46
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:20,916
when she is good in the kitchen
and a whore in bed.

47
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,666
Together with his personal
motorbike handyman, Jack,

48
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,791
who dreams of being a detective like him.

49
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,666
If you're looking for a partner,
just tell me.

50
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:30,791
Just tell me.

51
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:32,791
Okay.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,958
I'm going.

53
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,708
Hey, don't forget my side view mirror.

54
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:36,791
Okay.

55
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,250
No, don't bother. Let me.

56
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,625
The fun part of being a detective

57
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,750
is having an adventurous lifestyle

58
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,375
and a chance to become someone
you couldn't imagine yourself being.

59
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,416
Is it nice? Do you like it?

60
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,416
I don't know what you're talking about.

61
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,958
Jock starts to discover
a new form of happiness.

62
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,833
One that comes with a risk.

63
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:44,916
Surprise!

64
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,750
Jock.

65
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,291
It's spicy noodles today.

66
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,333
Come on, sit here.

67
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,458
I don't know if you'll like it.

68
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,708
Fan Chopsticks.

69
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,583
-What an idea!
-Yes.

70
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:05,958
Here.

71
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,583
It's hot. Perfect for your chopsticks!

72
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,166
-Is it delicious?
-It's good.

73
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,875
Making the soup took me...

74
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,625
a long time.

75
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,416
It's kind of viscous because it's...

76
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,541
Wow, it's hot. I mean...

77
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,625
I simmered it, you know?

78
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,750
And the coriander...

79
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,250
I...

80
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,625
Who is that?

81
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,375
Did you hear the intro
of the song I chose?

82
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,916
I'm going to sing it now.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,333
I'll be back.

84
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,541
Excuse me, guys.

85
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,583
Hold on!

86
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,083
-Hey, Curly Sue.
-Yes?

87
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,166
There's nothing happening here, right?

88
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,875
Yes.

89
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,583
It's quite calm.

90
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,458
Not even a breeze!

91
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,875
-Are you in a hurry?
-Yes!

92
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:10,916
Please.

93
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,083
Goodbye, then.

94
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,916
Should I remind you what day it is today?

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
No, sir.

96
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:29,833
Hey!

97
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,416
Search!

98
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,375
Eight thousand baht.

99
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,375
How much do you owe her?

100
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,625
Three hundred thousand, sir.

101
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,500
Do you know what's going to happen

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,541
if you miss the payment again?

103
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,041
You know what is coming, right?

104
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,416
You've already missed two installments.

105
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,833
I'm charging an additional 30% interest
for your late payment.

106
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,666
And last month had 31 days,

107
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,291
so that's another 1.5%.

108
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,666
Including the cost of wasting my time...

109
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,583
What is the usual rate for that?

110
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,708
-Five thousand baht.
-Five thousand.

111
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,250
Five thousand.

112
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:27,541
Yes. So you owe us 583,000 baht.

113
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,041
Altogether, if you round it up,
it's easier to remember...

114
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,333
Six hundred thousand baht.

115
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,416
Now you should know...

116
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,458
how torturous it is

117
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,625
when you're being suffocated.

118
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,041
He's here, Madam Saowapa.

119
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,875
Come sit over here, Mana,

120
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,125
so we can talk.

121
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,708
Hello.

122
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,291
It's my girl calling from the US.

123
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,625
Get it for me.

124
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,166
Yes, sweetie?

125
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,666
Yes.

126
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:35,375
Daddy is busy.
He doesn't have time to call you.

127
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,750
Yes.

128
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,125
All right, I'll remind him this evening.

129
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,625
Okay? Yes.

130
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,166
I really miss you.

131
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,750
That stupid prick!

132
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,583
Take a photo of that bitch

133
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,333
so I won't shoot the wrong one.

134
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,958
Easy, ma'am. Before you shoot anyone,

135
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,708
let me hear the whole story.

136
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,541
I smelled a rat
when I saw that plane ticket.

137
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,666
That jackass hasn't bought me
anything for ages.

138
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,208
Surprise!

139
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,708
You know what this is?

140
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,541
Hey.

141
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,250
You want to visit our kid
in the US, right?

142
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,166
Here. You can stay there
for the entire two weeks.

143
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,250
You'll definitely
have a great time with her.

144
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,833
What a sneaky idea!

145
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,833
Pay a little more
for a much bigger return.

146
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,791
Imagine, while you're gone...

147
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,541
Bang!

148
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,958
Baking his tube steak every day!

149
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:34,958
Until one night,

150
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,875
I caught him red-handed.

151
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,375
Wait.

152
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,291
What?

153
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,583
An inmate breaking out?

154
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,291
All right. Sure.

155
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,541
There is an emergency.
I have to go to the precinct.

156
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,125
You don't have to spy on him.

157
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,708
Your husband is surely having an affair.

158
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,333
Damn! Bitch!

159
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,500
All mistresses are bitches.

160
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,666
I want proof

161
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,291
of his guilt.

162
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,458
I want him caught red-handed.

163
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,291
So he won't mess around anymore.

164
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:55,041
If that's what you want, I'm with you.

165
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,208
Good.

166
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,125
He told me he'll be having
a meeting tomorrow night.

167
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,541
I think they must be planning to meet up.

168
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,750
Take photos of them.

169
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,416
All right.

170
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,333
Hey.

171
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,708
MANA ELECTRIC REPAIR SERVICE
FOR A LOW PRICE

172
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,916
Where did you come from?

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,916
Enough with that pitiful look.

174
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:33,958
Hungry?

175
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,500
Raise your front legs.

176
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,416
Wow...

177
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,458
Holy crap! What kind of dog are you?

178
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,666
Scratch your balls!

179
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,333
Just kidding. Come here!

180
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,791
Hey, what's your name?

181
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,625
Let me give you a name.

182
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,083
How about James Bond? Cool, right?

183
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:57,958
All right.

184
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,750
Eat up.

185
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,375
Hey!

186
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,708
What a mess!

187
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,500
Butt out!

188
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,833
Leave!

189
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,500
-Go!
-Get out of here, you shitty mutt!

190
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,625
That damn dog is making a mess
all over the place!

191
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,375
Very nasty!

192
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:23,875
Anyway...

193
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,916
I brought your side view mirror.

194
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,541
It smells like chicken!

195
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,708
Well, Mana...

196
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,250
I'm ready to join your detective venture.

197
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:42,750
Again?

198
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,708
Don't you have anything to do, Jack?

199
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,166
The life of a detective

200
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,375
is hanging by a thread.

201
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,458
When you eat, you have to hide.

202
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,958
When you sleep,

203
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,791
you can only close one eye.

204
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,208
Can you endure that, Jack?

205
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,125
I believe I was born to be one, Mana.

206
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,875
To be a grease monkey?

207
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,958
Great! You know yourself well

208
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,041
so you don't have too much ambition.

209
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,125
It's not that bad.

210
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,041
But Rue-Tai is right.

211
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,791
You know nothing about detective shit.

212
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:16,750
Right.

213
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:17,958
How can you say that?

214
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,125
You can ask me anything
about being a detective.

215
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,375
I know all about it.

216
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,500
Do you even remember the detective's
rules of thumb you've told me?

217
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,125
-I know them all. Ask me.
-What are they?

218
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,791
The first rule,

219
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,708
"Working for a mistress is prohibited."

220
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,083
The second rule,

221
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,083
"Don't ever fall in love with the target."

222
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,250
And the third rule

223
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,791
is also the most important.

224
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,250
"Do not blackmail your clients."

225
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,625
You're speechless?

226
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,041
See? I can help you.

227
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,041
We don't need your help.

228
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,583
Jock and I are the perfect partners.

229
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,416
Remember the pizza?

230
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,458
I baked a pizza for you.

231
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,291
-A pizza?
-Yes.

232
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,875
I assembled the pizza bike for him
until my hands almost burned.

233
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:02,875
Oh, really?

234
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,916
-You assemble his bike every day?
-Yes, I do.

235
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,958
Because I cook for him every day,
you know?

236
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,250
Three meals a day, seven days a week!

237
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,708
I'm the only one doing it,

238
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,500
the only one taking care of him.

239
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,625
-This asshole...
-Yes, this asshole!

240
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,000
He had me fix his bike,

241
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,958
but he never paid a dime.
I got scolded by my boss

242
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,916
-and I cried every night.
-Oh, really?

243
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,333
So it's just you?

244
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,875
Do you see what I'm holding?

245
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:25,958
The basket.

246
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,291
Which ones are mine? None!

247
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,125
His shirt, his pants, and this!

248
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,541
The masterpiece, his underwear!

249
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,291
I've never even washed my dad's.

250
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,916
You see any stains? Who washes all these?

251
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,791
It's me! Only me!

252
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,791
You still remember when you took a shit

253
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:41,875
and couldn't flush it down?

254
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:42,833
Hey!

255
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,000
What's going on here?

256
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,083
I know the two of you love me.

257
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,166
Actually, there is a big job waiting.

258
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:57,958
I'll give you two a chance,

259
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,166
so stop fighting.

260
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,791
Good.

261
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,166
-Hello.
-You are here too?

262
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,958
Come on in. I'll buy you a meal.

263
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,833
-Can I go now?
-Yes, sir.

264
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,708
Please.

265
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,750
No! I don't mess around at all.

266
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,750
Jesus.

267
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,041
Welcome.

268
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,166
Good evening, sir.

269
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,916
He just drank too much tonight.

270
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,041
Oh, I see.

271
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,083
-Let's go. Don't waste time here.
-Please. Go ahead.

272
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,916
Feeble hands!

273
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,541
That's for having a young wife.

274
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,875
Okay.

275
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,250
This way.

276
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,625
Target A still looks gloomy.

277
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,625
Target B hasn't shown up yet.

278
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,250
Nam-Pan... Over here!

279
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,625
Over here!

280
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,583
Nam-Pan! Right here!

281
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,583
Nam-Pan...

282
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,791
What kind of woman is Nam-Pan?

283
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,666
Just the sound of her name
makes me tingle.

284
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,791
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,875
Don't get mad at me, okay, darling?

286
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,166
Hey, Mana.

287
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,125
Do you see that chick?

288
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,166
I feel like breaking the second rule.

289
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,208
Falling in love with the target
is wrong, right?

290
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,333
Are you a good girl?

291
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,583
I brought you a reward.

292
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,250
Here.

293
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,708
Thank you, darling.

294
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,916
My pleasure.

295
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,208
It's 12:05 a.m.

296
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,375
Target B arrived at the pub.

297
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,083
Having a great time?

298
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,291
Pathetic!

299
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,125
You are just a mistress.

300
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,208
Jock, look! They're going out to dance.

301
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,375
Shall we dance too?

302
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,000
Like...

303
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,125
Hey!

304
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,833
You want to dance?

305
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,416
You're dancing with me?

306
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,875
What exactly do you want?

307
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,291
Give me the address and phone number

308
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,541
of that whore.

309
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,500
Sorry. Could you lower your voice?

310
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,625
My job is to take photos.

311
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,791
I can't do anything else besides that.

312
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,750
You should talk to your husband.

313
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,166
Give me her number

314
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,666
or you won't get paid.

315
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,000
I don't support violent response.

316
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,500
It violates my ethics as a detective.

317
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,583
Can you lift up the skin on my face
just like that slut?

318
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,750
You should go
to a plastic surgeon instead.

319
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,333
Really?

320
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:34,916
Wow, really,

321
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,625
there's a mega sale?

322
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,750
All right. I'll be there in 15 minutes.

323
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,750
Emporium Mall.

324
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,625
Turn right in the alley, it's a shortcut.

325
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,541
Please give me directions.
This is not my area.

326
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,541
Make a left.

327
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,666
Oh, no. Right.

328
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:00,958
What's wrong with your bike?

329
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,166
What's wrong with it?

330
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,875
It's out of gas.

331
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,166
I just filled the tank this morning.

332
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,541
If you didn't give the wrong directions,
we could've arrived there by now.

333
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,208
Here. Your soda.

334
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,500
It's quite a long walk to the main road.

335
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,125
Thank you.

336
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,166
Come on. We'll get there soon.

337
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,416
Don't you feel hot with that helmet?

338
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Why don't you take it off for now?

339
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,916
It's pretty tight. It's hard to take off.

340
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,458
This housing project is kind of nice.

341
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,500
With a little front yard...

342
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,250
Cool. I will use it to grow jasmine trees.

343
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,833
Sixty square yards is just right.
It's not too big.

344
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,416
Like being a minor, you mean?

345
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,333
Thank you.

346
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,041
How many times have you done this?

347
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,416
Please give me a few more days.

348
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,791
-I'll find 2,000 baht to pay you.
-Shut up.

349
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,791
As you know, selling noodles
doesn't provide much.

350
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,666
One bowl is around 20 to 30 baht.

351
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,833
I beg you, I'll pay you back
as soon as I can.

352
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,208
Please don't hurt me.

353
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,166
Tee, who's next?

354
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,708
Jock.

355
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,625
IT WILL BE YOUR TURN NEXT TIME,
NOT THIS CURLY SUE!

356
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,333
-Are you all right, Rue-Tai?
-Jock.

357
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,416
Why did they have to do this?

358
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:58,583
I'm sorry.

359
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:10,958
Madam Saowapa.

360
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,333
It's me, Mana.

361
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:13,916
Have your money ready.

362
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,083
I will exchange it
for her number in two days.

363
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,791
Wash your eyes, sweetie.

364
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,291
Why are your eyes closed?

365
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:10,958
I'm afraid

366
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,041
I will have nightmares.

367
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,500
What's wrong?

368
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:24,000
Rue-Tai, can I borrow your car?

369
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,500
All right.

370
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,708
If you want to have my Red Cutie,

371
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,916
you have to have her owner too.

372
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,791
Of course, I will.

373
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,291
We are all going together.

374
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:38,333
Naughty.

375
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,125
Shit.

376
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,375
Is that a flat or convex screen?

377
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,083
Target B has shown up.

378
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,750
It is a laptop, not a TV.

379
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,208
It is neither flat nor convex.

380
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,291
Well, too bad!

381
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
I like screens with protruding parts.

382
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:27,125
Can I have something like that?

383
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,208
Thank you.

384
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,833
Prepare the goods tonight.

385
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,500
I'll stop by to check it out.

386
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,375
You can't check anything today.

387
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:45,250
The port is temporarily closed
due to the monthly flood.

388
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:48,916
Isn't that...

389
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:54,375
supposed to be next week?

390
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,791
Damn!

391
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:02,875
Look!

392
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,541
What is this crap?

393
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,291
Why didn't he give me cash instead?

394
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,083
I didn't know

395
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:12,750
you also liked antiques.

396
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,416
I'm thinking about ditching him.

397
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,541
Three months with him
is all pain and no gain.

398
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,166
Unlike your new rich guy?

399
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,416
Yes,

400
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,333
I haven't lost anything

401
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:25,708
and he gave me a big gift.

402
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,958
A brand new Mercedes, right?

403
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,416
The target is reading Home magazine.

404
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,375
Hot.

405
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,750
Still reading Home magazine.

406
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,041
You don't even care...

407
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,000
if I can't sleep until tomorrow?

408
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:21,291
She is in the lingerie department.

409
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,750
The lace?

410
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:26,416
It's itchy. You'll get a rash.

411
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,041
No way! What year were you born in?

412
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,541
Even my grandma calls that outdated.

413
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:32,541
No.

414
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,125
That one over there.

415
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,125
That will work.

416
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:39,208
No, not purple.

417
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:41,833
The one next to it.

418
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,041
Yes, that's it.

419
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,333
The blush-rose color

420
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:45,750
with hooks in the back.

421
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:46,750
B-cup.

422
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,291
Superb!

423
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:49,916
Pretty and cute.

424
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,916
Standby.

425
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,541
Be at the meeting point in five minutes.

426
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,333
Jeez!

427
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:13,708
How the hell do you drive your car?
Look, my car is all busted.

428
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,916
Hey.

429
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,583
How could you?

430
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,708
What?

431
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,208
What are you talking about?

432
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:23,833
You're the one who bumped into me.

433
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,583
It's my lane.

434
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:26,833
You're supposed to wait,

435
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,166
-not cut in like this.
-It's useless to argue about it.

436
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,333
Let's call insurance.

437
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,500
Hello? Car accident.

438
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,958
Yes, in the parking lot.

439
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,791
-Insurance?
-Yes.

440
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:50,875
In case of a car accident,
we have to see your...

441
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:55,125
Well...

442
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:58,166
She...

443
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,125
She cut in from this side.

444
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:05,250
Can I have your ID?

445
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:08,875
Yes.

446
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,958
No!

447
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:12,916
No!

448
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,666
My poor baby.

449
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,625
Can you write down
your address in Bangkok?

450
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,666
And your phone number.

451
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,500
-Red Cutie...
-Your phone number here

452
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:29,458
-if I need to contact you...
-Red Cutie...

453
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:32,458
So which service garage can I go to?

454
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:37,166
I mean, which garage
have you been dealing with?

455
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,541
Right.

456
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:41,875
I see.

457
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,458
You can call this car service center.

458
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:44,416
This one right here.

459
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,375
JIRA GARAGE

460
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:46,333
Wait a minute.

461
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:49,583
Don't I need to fill out some paperwork?

462
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:52,541
I'm supposed to present something
to the repairman.

463
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:54,583
You don't need to.

464
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,583
I always remember a cute face.

465
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:36,166
THE PRICE STARTS AT 5.2 MILLION BAHT

466
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,916
Address confirmed.

467
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:18,958
Guess where I am right now.

468
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,625
I'm not very far from you, Nam-Pan.

469
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:35,291
I really miss you.

470
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:43,208
Wow!

471
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,041
It's nice.

472
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,416
How beautiful!

473
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,083
You made everything yourself?

474
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,333
You know my style.

475
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:53,375
That's why I'm crazy about you.

476
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:24,083
It's 11 p.m.

477
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,500
The target is with another man.

478
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,541
Isn't being one man's mistress bad enough?

479
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:34,125
Why are you like this?

480
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,750
Why?

481
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:38,666
You shouldn't...

482
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,583
You're kind of cute.

483
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:42,916
Damn it!

484
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:03,875
NAM-PAN

485
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:34,875
Good work.

486
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,916
I'll transfer your money
in a couple of days.

487
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:42,291
I hope you still remember what you said

488
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:44,208
about not doing anything violent.

489
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,291
No way!

490
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:56,708
No matter what, I won't get a divorce.

491
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:58,125
You!

492
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,333
If you want a divorce,

493
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:00,958
all assets must be divided in half.

494
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:02,583
Otherwise, you won't get one.

495
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,541
The only thing that should
be divided in half

496
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:05,958
is your age.

497
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:07,750
Then your lust

498
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,708
might need to be divided by four.

499
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:13,041
Your weight must be divided into eight
and subtracted by a hundred.

500
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,958
You son of a bitch!

501
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,083
Bastard!

502
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,333
You good-for-nothing!

503
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:18,500
Chunky Pig!

504
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:19,541
Fat Cow!

505
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,583
-Son of a bitch!
-Chunky Pig!

506
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:22,958
Madam!

507
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,708
The reporters are here, ma'am.

508
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,416
Okay, ma'am, we need to take some pictures

509
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,750
for the PR.

510
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,291
-Oh, sure.
-Go ahead.

511
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,541
-Come on.
-Here.

512
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:37,833
-Show some love.
-How?

513
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:39,291
-We love each other so much.
-We do.

514
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,791
-Yes. We're very much in love.
-Hug.

515
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,291
-Let's hug.
-Hug...

516
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,666
I love you.

517
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,916
Let's make it 70-30.

518
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,291
Again.

519
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,541
No, 50-50.

520
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:54,833
Just 60-40.

521
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:56,833
No, 50!

522
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,458
You've got a phone call, ma'am.

523
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:01,666
Thanks, honey.

524
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:05,416
Excuse me. I have to answer the phone.

525
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:06,833
-Honey.
-Yes?

526
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:07,958
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

527
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:08,916
Just a second.

528
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,708
Don't make it too long, honey.

529
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,708
Want a single shot of me?

530
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,708
Well? Did you collect all the payments?

531
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,375
There is one who refused to pay.
But don't worry...

532
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,333
I'll take care of it.

533
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,375
Holy shit!

534
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,791
Fix it without telling anyone.

535
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,458
Hello? Is anyone home?

536
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,125
We are here to collect the debt.

537
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,416
You think he will answer you?

538
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,708
Come on. Get away from me...

539
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,416
before I punch your doggy eyes.

540
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:04,583
Oh, you're here.
I've been looking for you.

541
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:06,666
That is my line, isn't it?

542
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,916
Should I remind you what day it is today?

543
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:12,500
Sir,

544
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:15,291
can I have two more days?

545
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,500
I'll surely have the money for you.

546
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,458
Mommy!

547
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:29,541
Mommy!

548
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:30,875
Mommy!

549
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,875
You are such a pain in the ass.

550
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,791
Don't you remember

551
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:45,875
what will happen to you

552
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,333
if you don't pay me today?

553
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:49,791
Hey.

554
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:52,041
You are mine.

555
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:58,000
You dare fight back?

556
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:04,833
Are you afraid?

557
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:07,791
Scaredy cat.

558
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:14,333
If you don't pay up

559
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,166
your debt next time,

560
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,416
this bullet

561
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:20,958
will be...

562
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,250
buried in your brain.

563
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:28,875
Got that?

564
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,916
Come in, ma'am.

565
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:52,500
Hungry, my boy?

566
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,875
Have you eaten yet?

567
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,375
-Well...
-I've already fed you. Hungry again?

568
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:59,375
-You're hungry again?
-Your...

569
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,375
Your dog...

570
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,000
May I?

571
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,666
Let's cut to the chase, ma'am.

572
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:11,750
Here.

573
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:16,416
Are you taking your car to the garage?

574
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,500
Yes.

575
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,291
I don't want to wait, it might get rusty.

576
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:21,000
I want the pictures of him

577
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:23,833
sleeping next to that slut.
I want their faces to be as clear as day!

578
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,625
Clear enough for me to win

579
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,000
a divorce case in court.

580
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,291
What type of evidence do you want?

581
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:32,708
Still pictures

582
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:34,166
or video clips?

583
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:36,541
I want a clip

584
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:39,000
showing their movements close-up.

585
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:42,291
Can you zoom in on their faces
as closely as you can?

586
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,958
I've made countless couples divorce.

587
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,166
And yours...

588
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:50,958
will be next!

589
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:34,250
Who is right there?

590
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:39,583
You're so cute.

591
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,666
What's your name?

592
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,583
Wow! You're wearing a yellow shirt.

593
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:45,875
Biggy Nose!

594
00:42:57,583 --> 00:43:00,583
JIRA GARAGE

595
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,916
Are you Nam-Pan?

596
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:16,875
Yes, I am.

597
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:19,708
Nam-Pan the Pretty Presenter, right?

598
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,958
Yes, I am.
Are you contacting me for a job?

599
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:26,625
Well, what stuff do you sell

600
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,166
-I sell...
-besides your body?

601
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:34,125
Who is this?

602
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,791
You're the one I'm sharing
my husband with.

603
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:40,375
Let me know when you put

604
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:41,875
the skin on your face on sale.

605
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:44,041
I'll be sure to buy it
so I can stitch my shoes with it.

606
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,458
You are a shameless whore.

607
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,583
Stop fucking around with my man!

608
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,125
To be a detective,

609
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:04,166
you should have

610
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,250
what it takes.

611
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:07,083
You fat ass!

612
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:09,333
If you two keep behaving like this,
I'll work alone next time.

613
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:10,708
Oh, no, Jock.

614
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,250
I'm just kidding.

615
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:14,208
We're not fighting, right?

616
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:20,625
Hey.

617
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:24,583
Well, the spare part you ordered

618
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:25,791
-Spare part?
-is over there!

619
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:26,750
Follow me.

620
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,666
-The ones you ordered.
-Oh, the spare part!

621
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,958
You gave my number
to the Inspector's wife?

622
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,500
I have no idea

623
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:35,916
what you're talking about.

624
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,333
Stop playing dumb.

625
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:39,625
Give me the money for the repair now,

626
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:41,083
or I'll call the cops.

627
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:42,416
Hey!

628
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:45,125
-Take it easy. We can talk.
-No!

629
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:47,541
I want my money right now!

630
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:50,958
Hold on.

631
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:57,875
Hello, Mana speaking.

632
00:44:57,958 --> 00:45:00,541
He's leaving the office in 15 minutes.

633
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,375
-Come here immediately!
-Yes, ma'am.

634
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,291
-Take as many shots as you can.
-All right.

635
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:06,375
I'll capture every position.

636
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:08,791
Okay. I'll give you
the pictures right away.

637
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:09,791
I see.

638
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,083
You're a detective for love affairs.

639
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:13,916
You're a sinner.

640
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,208
Give me a break!

641
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:16,791
Between you and me,

642
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:18,041
you are the wicked one!

643
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:23,125
Where do you think you're going?

644
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,000
Oh, you're trying to run away?

645
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,708
-We need to talk.
-I'm busy.

646
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,333
Hey!

647
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:41,750
Ouch!

648
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:47,041
Ouch!

649
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,541
Hey! That's too much!

650
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:05,458
How am I going to ride this?

651
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:18,125
Where are you going?

652
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:20,916
To work. The sinful one, remember?

653
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,041
What about my money?

654
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,458
For God's sake.

655
00:46:24,958 --> 00:46:25,916
You still want it?

656
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,708
How about the cost of my bike repair?

657
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:28,916
Sure.

658
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,583
I'll pay you to fix your bike.

659
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,208
And you pay me to fix my car.

660
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,208
You're unbelievable. I'm in a hurry. Bye.

661
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,500
"In a hurry"?

662
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,125
What the hell?

663
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:41,833
What are you doing?

664
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:49,250
Why did you get in?

665
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,875
Aren't you afraid of me running away?

666
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:51,875
Let's go together, then.

667
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:54,750
Don't you get it?

668
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:56,458
What do you want? I'm leaving.

669
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:58,666
Where to?

670
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:01,833
Drive. I'll tell you the directions.

671
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,083
Turn right here. Go straight ahead
past the next two intersections.

672
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:11,291
Then turn left.

673
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,125
There will be a big building on your left.

674
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,750
Park nearby and keep your lights blinking.

675
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,208
I'm not a cab driver!
Stop bossing me around.

676
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,958
If you want me to take a cab,

677
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:21,625
just pull over, I'll get off.

678
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:24,958
I'm not that stupid
to let you go without paying.

679
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,250
Is that all you think about?

680
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,375
So stingy.

681
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:38,583
Come on! Follow that BMW.

682
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:40,750
The black one.

683
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:42,041
Come on!

684
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:46,708
You're so silly.

685
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,083
Stop it,

686
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:49,708
Mr. Songpol.

687
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:52,541
You're always teasing me like this.

688
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:56,708
Faster. They're over there.

689
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:57,958
I know!

690
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:00,958
This is my car.
Stop telling me what to do.

691
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:01,958
Well...

692
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:04,708
if you didn't crash my bike into the bush,
I wouldn't ask you for any favors.

693
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:06,125
I don't know if it's still there.

694
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,708
Slow down or they will see us.

695
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:14,916
What exactly do you want, fast or slow?
Do you want to drive yourself?

696
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,083
Wait.

697
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,583
Why did you get past them?

698
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,958
I already paid.
What am I waiting for, then?

699
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,041
We are supposed to be following them,
not the other way round.

700
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,000
Got it?

701
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,125
Oh, yes...

702
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:43,833
To the left lane.

703
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:53,583
What are you doing?

704
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,208
I'm just going to take their pictures.

705
00:48:55,291 --> 00:48:57,083
Jesus! Where have they gone?

706
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:58,541
How would I know?

707
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:00,041
You reached for my boobs.

708
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,666
And you almost touched it.

709
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,375
That's what you're thinking.

710
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,666
Such dirty thoughts!

711
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:06,250
You jerk!

712
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:09,583
Hey, where are they?

713
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:11,625
Which way, left or right?

714
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:14,875
Left or right?

715
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:17,458
I'm turning left, then.

716
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:29,041
There they are.

717
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:44,791
-Surprise!
-Wow!

718
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,333
Black forest!

719
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:52,875
Oh, yes!

720
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,416
Are you all right, darling?

721
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,250
Nui Bang Lumpu case closed.

722
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:19,833
Case closed!

723
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:24,750
You think he's going to be all right?

724
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,625
You punched him in the eyes.

725
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,666
You were great,

726
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,583
you handed me the camera and saved my ass.

727
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:32,833
If it wasn't for me,

728
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:34,958
you would've probably gotten lost
on the expressway.

729
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:36,583
Luckily,

730
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:38,333
you turned the correct way.

731
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:39,875
Otherwise, we would've been flying blind.

732
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:42,666
There is only one motel in that area.

733
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:44,791
We should have taken pictures

734
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:47,416
before they got into the motel.

735
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,000
No way!

736
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,625
Those girls always

737
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:53,000
hide themselves while entering the motel.

738
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:19,958
Nam-Pan.

739
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,625
I think that the driver wants
to take a shit.

740
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,000
How do you know?

741
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:26,416
Look at his license plate.

742
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:28,666
"Fart 8888."

743
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,208
That jerk is so poor.

744
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:35,375
"Starve." Nothing to eat,
just one meal a day.

745
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:40,375
That is a sex bomb's car.

746
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:41,791
"Boob 36."

747
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,583
That's enormous.

748
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:49,208
This car's owner

749
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,416
is surely a hen.

750
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:52,000
KK 0000
BANGKOK

751
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:54,208
You mean like a hen

752
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:55,541
that sits on her four eggs?

753
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,250
If the plate gets bigger,
there will be dozens of them.

754
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:02,541
This one is funny.

755
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:04,500
His wife might chew him up.

756
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:06,291
"Wimp."

757
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,958
What's wrong with you?

758
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:09,083
Excuse me. It's all set.

759
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:11,791
-It's all set.
-Let me pay.

760
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:14,958
-How much is it?
-A thousand baht.

761
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,208
What?

762
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,083
A thousand?

763
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,583
I'll pay for you next time.

764
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:28,250
I'll drive you home.

765
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,291
Where are you going?

766
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:47,125
Madam,

767
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:49,500
would you like to test the engine first?

768
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:50,750
Yes, that's a good idea.

769
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:52,166
No need to go.

770
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:53,958
She knows all about it.

771
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:58,208
Come on. Let's keep on singing.

772
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:01,333
Let's sing.

773
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:07,041
Nam-Pan.

774
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:09,208
This is Rue-Tai and Jack.

775
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:20,750
Mana, isn't this against the rules?

776
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:22,708
What rules?

777
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:25,333
The detective's rules of thumb.

778
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:29,041
Oh, that's all right. We're off duty now.

779
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:46,541
Sing for us, Rue-Tai.

780
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,000
Even professional singers

781
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:51,083
can't beat her, you know?

782
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,291
I believe Thai people can fly!

783
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,375
Hey.

784
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:04,041
You're off duty now.

785
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:06,333
And what about her,
what time does she get off?

786
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,125
What are you talking about?

787
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:15,333
The mistress.
What are their working hours?

788
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,750
Jack, listen!

789
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,583
I think you are drunk.

790
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:22,041
You'd better go to bed.

791
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:28,458
You're fooling me.

792
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,333
RUE-TAI KARAOKE

793
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:46,625
You should leave

794
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:50,875
I don't want to be like this

795
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:54,708
And I don't want to be called a bad person

796
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:58,291
Everything between us is just an illusion

797
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:01,500
Don't go further than this

798
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:05,041
Please stop

799
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:07,958
Come with me, Nam-Pan.

800
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,000
Where to?

801
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:11,166
Come on.

802
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:34,958
-Oh! That day...
-Got you!

803
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:36,875
I know you like them.

804
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:38,333
I still have a lot more upstairs.

805
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:39,416
I'll show you.

806
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:41,208
Come on.

807
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:06,750
You made them all by yourself?

808
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:08,041
Come here.

809
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:11,500
This one...

810
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:14,541
The pedal-powered massage chair.

811
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,666
An innovative invention
for relieving muscle pain.

812
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:20,958
When I pedal, the machine
will start to operate.

813
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:23,625
See?

814
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:25,708
Now your back pain is gone.

815
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:29,833
And I get sore legs instead?

816
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,083
No...

817
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:38,541
You can hand massage your legs.

818
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:39,958
But you can't reach your back.

819
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,958
Right?

820
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:48,208
Anyway, our legs don't get sore easily.

821
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,833
Back pain can render people disabled.
It needs to be massaged when it aches.

822
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:54,541
You can try pedaling.

823
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:57,583
I mean pedal my bike, not me.

824
00:58:58,708 --> 00:58:59,666
Here...

825
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:01,708
I proudly present this invention.

826
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:04,083
Oh, wow!

827
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,458
The great bathing machine.

828
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:09,875
Be careful.

829
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:16,500
That's so awesome, Jock!

830
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:18,958
Hey! Give it a try.

831
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:21,625
Don't worry, I turned off the tab.

832
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,000
Get in there.

833
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:25,458
I don't want to get wet.

834
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:26,708
No. See? Just a few drops.

835
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:28,083
This is

836
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:29,875
for washing your hair.

837
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,000
You can try it.

838
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:35,833
Isn't it cool?

839
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:38,666
This is for scrubbing your body.

840
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,291
This is for your legs.

841
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:50,458
Yes, it works!

842
00:59:50,708 --> 00:59:52,041
It can be operated simultaneously.

843
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:02,166
Hell, no! Stop it.

844
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:04,666
There.

845
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:07,208
This machine here,

846
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:08,666
it's for...

847
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,958
a single man like me
who needs somebody to rub his back.

848
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:16,041
I think a regular shower is easier, Jock.

849
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,125
Let's go over there.

850
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:25,291
You're going to like it. The Genius Hand.
Take a look.

851
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:27,125
Tell me. Where is he?

852
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:32,958
Or you can do this.

853
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,791
One, two, three.

854
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,208
Or something like this.

855
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:40,375
Are you mad at me?

856
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:43,833
Please forgive me?

857
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,625
Or something like this.

858
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,208
What's his name?

859
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:13,291
I don't know.

860
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:15,750
It's just a mongrel. Don't touch him.

861
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:17,791
He's so cute.

862
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:22,125
The next challenge is...

863
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:24,833
a bird!

864
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:33,041
Hey.

865
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:35,250
Who taught you
how to fold a paper bird like that?

866
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:37,583
What?

867
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:39,208
You're helpless.

868
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:41,000
Or do you just want beer for free?

869
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Are you crazy?

870
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,083
Come on.

871
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,250
Okay.

872
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,083
Let's do this!

873
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:54,541
The next challenge is...

874
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:56,000
a chameleon!

875
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:57,833
Hey!

876
01:01:58,208 --> 01:02:00,833
Who the hell can fold a paper chameleon?

877
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:06,125
That's cheating.

878
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:07,916
No, it's a work of art.

879
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:09,458
It's a giant chameleon,

880
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:10,583
Godzilla!

881
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:12,791
Quack!

882
01:02:13,708 --> 01:02:15,416
It's all right if you can't make it.

883
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,375
I can.

884
01:02:18,416 --> 01:02:19,333
Gosh.

885
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,333
You drank the whole bottle.

886
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:29,291
I will...

887
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:32,083
let you fold whatever you want

888
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:33,625
and I'll go down to get more beer.

889
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,416
And then we'll have another round.

890
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,083
See? I'm giving you an advantage.

891
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:41,416
Good.

892
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:38,833
A cat.

893
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:40,958
You can't do it, right?

894
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:12,416
NAM-PAN

895
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:29,208
Nam-Pan.

896
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:31,041
What kind of woman is Nam-Pan?

897
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,958
Just the sound of her name
makes me tingle.

898
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,750
Don't smile.

899
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:41,416
I can't stand it.

900
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:45,041
Well, she's kind of cute.

901
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:47,750
Oh, she has beautiful eyes.

902
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:50,708
The blush-rose color

903
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:52,083
with hooks in the back.

904
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:53,500
B-cup.

905
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:54,708
Superb!

906
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:56,166
Pretty and cute.

907
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,291
I'd give her a big kiss on her cheek.

908
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:05,750
Address confirmed.

909
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:08,083
The target is with another man.

910
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,375
Isn't being one man's mistress bad enough?

911
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:13,166
Why are you like this?

912
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:14,583
Why?

913
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:16,291
You shouldn't...

914
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:18,250
You're kind of cute.

915
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:20,208
Damn it!

916
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:26,250
One day you will pay the price

917
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:27,916
for messing with other people's families.

918
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:31,583
Faking innocence.

919
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:34,125
You are just a mistress.

920
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:25,500
Get out!

921
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,125
I'll slap your ear off.

922
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,083
Do you hear me?

923
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:31,875
Get out!

924
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,083
That almost turned me on.

925
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:50,333
Hello, Nam-Pan.

926
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:52,500
Why didn't you wake me up?

927
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:55,166
You were sleeping.
I didn't want to disturb you.

928
01:07:56,416 --> 01:07:58,166
I'm driving, I can't talk right now.

929
01:07:59,000 --> 01:07:59,875
Okay.

930
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,250
Don't tell me that you...

931
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:28,208
What's wrong with you?

932
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:02,041
What's up?

933
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,541
Why are you here?

934
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:06,375
I...

935
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:10,000
I forgot.

936
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:14,958
Can I recall it inside?

937
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:50,208
Somebody is here.

938
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:02,375
Go hide.

939
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:38,541
Where are you going, my bunny?

940
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:42,500
Take it easy.

941
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:46,083
Gosh! Your apartment is like a rat hole.

942
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:48,708
I bump into something every time I move.

943
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:49,958
How about

944
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:52,500
I buy you a new house?

945
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:54,666
A big one with plenty of space.

946
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,625
A big one.

947
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:11,125
Go play somewhere else.

948
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:13,916
Come inside the house, love.

949
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:17,041
What's wrong with you?

950
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:19,250
Cut the crap!

951
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:24,416
Hey.

952
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:26,875
Who the hell are you?

953
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:35,416
The target is in.
Everything is going according to plan.

954
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,375
I think I'd better go.

955
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:40,208
Thank you for allowing me to hide here.

956
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:41,875
Goodbye.

957
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:48,166
Hey, wait! What is going on here?

958
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:50,166
Don't panic, sir.

959
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,750
I'm looking for
an international terrorist.

960
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:55,250
My intel said he is hiding
in the room next door.

961
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:57,708
Are you an FBI agent?

962
01:11:57,791 --> 01:11:59,958
No. I'm just a private detective.

963
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:02,625
If there's anything I can help you with,
don't hesitate to call me.

964
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:04,583
Here.

965
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:06,708
But for now,

966
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:08,458
I have to excuse myself
to serve my country.

967
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,000
The door is right there.

968
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:22,583
What kind of detective is he?

969
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:36,166
Excuse me.

970
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:37,458
Excuse me.

971
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:39,458
Can you help me find my contact lens?

972
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:40,458
Yes?

973
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:41,916
-Contact lens?
-Yes.

974
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,583
Yes. I don't know where I've dropped it.

975
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:45,958
-Around here?
-Yes.

976
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:48,375
Help me look for it on that side.

977
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:49,541
Sure.

978
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:51,500
-Hold my camera for a second.
-Okay.

979
01:13:00,666 --> 01:13:01,708
What do you want?

980
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:03,833
Do you have any enemies?

981
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:06,416
What enemies?

982
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:07,666
Come here.

983
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,250
You see that pizza boy?

984
01:13:10,333 --> 01:13:11,250
Yes?

985
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:12,833
He asked me

986
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:15,750
about a guy with a receding hairline
and a mole, who looks like a freak

987
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,541
and is wearing a black shirt and khakis.

988
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:20,833
He told me that

989
01:13:21,166 --> 01:13:22,250
he has been hired

990
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:24,875
to take pictures
of a man and his mistress.

991
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:27,708
And the camera he's holding...

992
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:29,583
Even a retard knows

993
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:32,375
that it's equipped with a superzoom lens,

994
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:33,916
the latest model.

995
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,541
It can even capture
a tiny object from afar.

996
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:38,291
Fuck it!

997
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,083
That fat cow

998
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,833
is really whooping my ass.

999
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:44,541
Oh, you found it?

1000
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:45,750
Not yet.

1001
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:52,000
What should I do?

1002
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:54,625
I think you'd better get out of sight.

1003
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,208
I will lure him the other way.

1004
01:13:58,541 --> 01:13:59,916
And you'll go this way.

1005
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,916
Okay.

1006
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:03,958
Thanks a lot, man. I appreciate it.

1007
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:08,958
-I found it.
-Oh, you did?

1008
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:10,000
Where did you drop it?

1009
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:11,750
I dropped it over there.

1010
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,333
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1011
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,625
You are handsome and very kind!

1012
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:16,375
-I get that all the time.
-Yes.

1013
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:18,791
-What room are you delivering this to?
-Room 501.

1014
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:20,583
That room is downstairs.

1015
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:23,083
-Downstairs?
-Yes. I'll take you there.

1016
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:24,875
Thank you.

1017
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,791
This was left at your door.

1018
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:12,708
DEAR MANA, YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW WHO I AM

1019
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:14,791
I WANT PICTURES OF THE OLD HAG
MAKING OUT WITH HER PIMP

1020
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:16,166
JUST FOLLOW THE MAP I HAVE PROVIDED

1021
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:18,125
HALF OF THE PAYMENT
FINISH THE JOB AND GET THE REST

1022
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:19,958
Jack, I need your help.

1023
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:25,833
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

1024
01:15:25,916 --> 01:15:27,083
Rue-Tai didn't pick up the phone.

1025
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:28,791
I'll try again.

1026
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,333
Never mind, Jack.

1027
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:57,291
I'm already inside. What's next?

1028
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:58,958
Do you see the target?

1029
01:16:08,208 --> 01:16:10,125
Yes, I do. Should I go in now?

1030
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:11,166
Yes.

1031
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:13,500
Don't be afraid, Nam-Pan.

1032
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:14,875
I'm looking out for you.

1033
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:17,875
Are you here alone, miss?

1034
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:20,083
-Yes.
-Do you mind if I join you?

1035
01:16:20,916 --> 01:16:22,333
-This way, please.
-Okay.

1036
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:24,958
What would you like to drink?

1037
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,291
This way, please.

1038
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:28,666
Shit! Jack...

1039
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,583
we have to switch to plan B.

1040
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:31,958
Ready?

1041
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:32,958
Ready.

1042
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:34,958
Let's drink.

1043
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:36,208
No, thank you.

1044
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:38,583
Harder! I like it rough.

1045
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:14,791
Go get your stuff.

1046
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:16,916
All the drinks are on me tonight.

1047
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:20,875
Very good, ma'am.

1048
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:30,625
Come on!

1049
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,583
Hey!

1050
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:34,583
Rue-Tai!

1051
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:37,750
You're also here to help me? Oh, thanks!

1052
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:38,958
I just passed by

1053
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:41,041
and saw this nice place.

1054
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:43,791
But I didn't know
it would be this crowded.

1055
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:45,291
I don't like it.

1056
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:46,833
I'll go back with you.

1057
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,000
Sorry, my boyfriend is here.

1058
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:50,875
Wow!

1059
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,750
That's exactly my type.

1060
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:54,041
Come on!

1061
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:56,708
Come with me.

1062
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,666
It's a misunderstanding. He is my husband.

1063
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:01,833
What? Get your hands off him, bitch!

1064
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:04,083
Go back to your farm, you milk cow!

1065
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:05,500
Jock!

1066
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:06,833
Come here. Come with me.

1067
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:08,250
-Come here!
-No, Jock.

1068
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:09,416
Come with me.

1069
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:10,541
Come on! Help me.

1070
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:42,791
I think you have a talent as a detective.

1071
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:45,291
Do you want to be with me?

1072
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:47,666
I mean, join my team.

1073
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:04,333
I know you like doing things in secret.

1074
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:07,541
Being a detective seems more fun
than being a mistress.

1075
01:19:11,708 --> 01:19:12,791
So awesome.

1076
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,416
That's it for now.

1077
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:22,833
I'll have a watermelon frappe too.

1078
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:25,708
I like frappes, Nam-Pan.

1079
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:29,166
What should I eat first?

1080
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:31,208
Do you want to talk to me, Mr. Sorn?

1081
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:32,666
Sure.

1082
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,791
It's about your new house.

1083
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:36,833
We have to make a down payment tomorrow.

1084
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:38,583
I've seen it.

1085
01:19:38,666 --> 01:19:40,541
It's as big as a mansion.

1086
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:42,166
Only six million baht.

1087
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:45,958
I'm not sure if you'll like it, Nam-Pan.

1088
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:52,541
Let me have a look at those pictures.

1089
01:20:09,791 --> 01:20:11,500
This fat cow!

1090
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:13,750
Shit! I can't believe
she has such bad taste.

1091
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:16,708
You won't even get a penny

1092
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:18,958
after the divorce.

1093
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:22,208
That day will come

1094
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:24,333
when we'll be a happy couple.

1095
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:35,125
Give me a moment.

1096
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:37,250
I will be back to write you a check.

1097
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,916
I have to step outside
to attend to some business.

1098
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:44,750
Yes, Adisorn speaking.

1099
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:50,958
-What does this mean, Jock?
-Are you happy now?

1100
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,833
Once they get divorced,
you'll become his wife.

1101
01:20:56,458 --> 01:20:58,208
That's why you were so willing to help.

1102
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:01,666
Did you enjoy

1103
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:03,916
using me?

1104
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:18,041
You think I'm that wicked?

1105
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:50,875
Thanks a lot.

1106
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:52,791
Why haven't you

1107
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:54,750
eaten anything yet?

1108
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:56,875
Why are you sitting still

1109
01:21:56,958 --> 01:21:59,625
and not eating? The food is getting cold.

1110
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,125
Here.

1111
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:05,083
Let's eat.

1112
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:06,583
It's good.

1113
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:09,916
Damn!

1114
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:14,125
This Mana has missed so many payments.

1115
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:15,708
Next time,

1116
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:17,708
double the interest for his account...

1117
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:19,791
-Got it, Somsak?
-Yes, madam.

1118
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:22,333
Madam,

1119
01:22:22,416 --> 01:22:23,958
you have a phone call.

1120
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:25,083
Thanks.

1121
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,458
Hello? Who is this?

1122
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:30,250
Hello, madam.

1123
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:32,250
I've already made

1124
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:34,041
a copy of that CD.

1125
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:35,708
The script is very clear.

1126
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:38,125
All right.

1127
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,416
I'll have your money ready.

1128
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,500
It all costs 100,000, right?

1129
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,041
Well...

1130
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:47,291
it turned out the job was tougher
than expected.

1131
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:50,083
I have to charge you more
because of the risky nature of the job.

1132
01:22:51,916 --> 01:22:52,791
How much more?

1133
01:22:53,541 --> 01:22:56,416
I'm raising it to 300,000?

1134
01:22:56,750 --> 01:23:00,208
If you're okay with that,
the CD and its case are yours.

1135
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,500
I won't even give you a single penny,

1136
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:04,750
you crooked detective!

1137
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:09,333
You guys!

1138
01:23:09,416 --> 01:23:11,583
Go get the CD from that detective.

1139
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:13,208
Understand?

1140
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:14,291
Yes, madam.

1141
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:22,833
MR. SORN

1142
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:27,000
Where are you, honey?

1143
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:28,958
Have you forgotten about our date?

1144
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:31,708
I've been waiting for you
at the sales office.

1145
01:23:31,791 --> 01:23:33,625
I'm so hot and hungry,

1146
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,000
and I miss you so much.

1147
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:37,500
You don't want a house anymore?

1148
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:40,416
-No, I don't want it anymore.
-Why?

1149
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,458
-Thank you.
-You said you wanted it.

1150
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:07,541
Hello, Nam-Pan.

1151
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:09,958
Are you interested

1152
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:11,708
in a CD of a scandalous pretty girl

1153
01:24:11,791 --> 01:24:14,833
and her businessman?

1154
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:17,833
Who are you?

1155
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:19,916
My identity is not important.
The point is...

1156
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:22,750
if you want this CD, follow the map

1157
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:27,375
placed on your wardrobe.
Bring 300,000 in exchange for it.

1158
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:31,166
Come alone. If you try anything funny,

1159
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:34,833
this CD will be sent to your mother.

1160
01:24:51,083 --> 01:24:52,333
Can we talk?

1161
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:54,583
This is not funny at all.

1162
01:24:54,666 --> 01:24:56,083
Back off! I'm in a hurry.

1163
01:24:58,291 --> 01:24:59,625
Give me a second chance.

1164
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:01,666
Not now.

1165
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,625
I have a very important thing to do.

1166
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:04,916
Where are you going?

1167
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:12,583
You're not going to tell me?

1168
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:15,750
You're going nowhere, then.

1169
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:17,041
Jock!

1170
01:25:17,666 --> 01:25:20,541
Jack! Don't you even care?
She needs our help.

1171
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:21,791
Is it a good idea?

1172
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:23,333
Working for a mistress

1173
01:25:23,416 --> 01:25:24,708
is against the rule.

1174
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:26,375
I don't want to do it.

1175
01:25:26,958 --> 01:25:28,583
Forget those damn rules.

1176
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,291
Listen to me.

1177
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,291
You will understand it

1178
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:33,541
when you love someone.

1179
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:36,875
Damn!

1180
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:38,791
You sound like a fucking gentleman!

1181
01:25:39,125 --> 01:25:41,541
Cool, man, all right. See you there.

1182
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:42,833
See you.

1183
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:49,125
I'll take you there.

1184
01:26:20,833 --> 01:26:23,333
Hello, Nam-Pan.

1185
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:24,875
Did you come alone?

1186
01:26:24,958 --> 01:26:26,416
Do you see anyone with me?

1187
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,500
James Bond.

1188
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:38,833
It's showtime.

1189
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,000
My dog.

1190
01:27:08,125 --> 01:27:09,875
Tee, park the humvee here.

1191
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:29,916
Let's go.

1192
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,041
Hold on.

1193
01:27:31,833 --> 01:27:34,500
If we go this way, he will notice it.

1194
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:36,333
I think we'd better use

1195
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:37,458
the other route.

1196
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:39,750
Follow me.

1197
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:58,625
Please have a seat.

1198
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:04,833
My name is Sutin.

1199
01:28:06,125 --> 01:28:08,083
What would you like to drink?

1200
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:10,458
Wine, orange juice,

1201
01:28:10,708 --> 01:28:12,666
or bael fruit juice?

1202
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:15,000
-Where is the CD?
-Wow!

1203
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:19,458
Do you have an appointment with your man?

1204
01:28:20,583 --> 01:28:23,541
Take it easy.

1205
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:26,583
You'll get it soon.

1206
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:30,083
Where is my 300,000?

1207
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:33,208
Give me the CD

1208
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:35,666
or you'll never get the money.

1209
01:29:03,416 --> 01:29:04,375
Tee,

1210
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:06,041
keep a lookout right here.

1211
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:11,041
I think this house is dangerous.

1212
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:15,291
It must be equipped with laser traps.

1213
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:16,666
What should we do, then?

1214
01:29:18,833 --> 01:29:19,833
Unzip it.

1215
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:25,625
The zip on your backpack!

1216
01:29:44,958 --> 01:29:45,958
What are you doing?

1217
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:47,666
Uploading data.

1218
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:52,958
How did you get in here?

1219
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:54,750
What data?

1220
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:58,125
It's the file we have to give to Madam.

1221
01:29:58,208 --> 01:29:59,125
Moron!

1222
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:04,791
There's a copy of it right here.

1223
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:06,583
Well, yes.

1224
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:08,083
We've got company.

1225
01:30:09,083 --> 01:30:10,791
Find a place to hide.

1226
01:30:11,541 --> 01:30:12,583
Hey! Help me first.

1227
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,375
I guess it's on his computer.

1228
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:46,791
It's dark in here. Turn on the flashlight.

1229
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:48,541
Just a second.

1230
01:30:50,583 --> 01:30:52,833
-Here you go.
-Who are they?

1231
01:30:56,041 --> 01:30:56,916
Gosh.

1232
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:03,041
Damn!

1233
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:04,458
I thought you'd ask a pro to help you.

1234
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:06,208
It's just this useless detective.

1235
01:31:11,291 --> 01:31:12,333
Rue-Tai!

1236
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:30,916
What's going on here?

1237
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:45,958
Shit!

1238
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:51,000
VIDEO OF NAM-PAN AND MR. ADISORN

1239
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:13,916
Give that CD to me.

1240
01:32:17,958 --> 01:32:19,791
-I have a knife.
-Give it to me.

1241
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:24,458
Can't you just hand it to me?

1242
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:30,958
You can't die. I haven't paid off my debt.

1243
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:33,500
Watch out!

1244
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:37,166
You asshole!

1245
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:46,750
Ouch, boss. That hurt.

1246
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:50,666
Son of a bitch!

1247
01:32:50,791 --> 01:32:53,166
You think you're tough?

1248
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:57,791
I got it. Let's get out of here.

1249
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:13,833
Hey!

1250
01:33:14,583 --> 01:33:15,875
Why did you do that?

1251
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:19,333
Get in the car!

1252
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:21,791
Hey! Get in.

1253
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:29,791
Get in.

1254
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:35,166
-I can't open it.
-Why not?

1255
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:37,333
The key is with Tee.

1256
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,458
And where is Tee?

1257
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:42,458
Tee is with the key.

1258
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:54,583
Wait. Where is James Bond?

1259
01:33:54,958 --> 01:33:55,916
James Bond?

1260
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:57,625
Wait!

1261
01:33:59,791 --> 01:34:00,916
James Bond.

1262
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,416
-James Bond.
-James Bond.

1263
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,541
Get down here!

1264
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:05,458
Come on! Get in!

1265
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:06,541
Come here!

1266
01:34:06,625 --> 01:34:07,916
James Bond.

1267
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:11,083
Good boy, James Bond.

1268
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:13,875
Let's go before they come after us.

1269
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:16,541
-How did you get in here?
-What?

1270
01:34:16,625 --> 01:34:17,500
Why are you in our car?

1271
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:19,333
Get the hell out!

1272
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:20,416
Get out!

1273
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:22,083
How the hell did you get in?

1274
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:43,125
Look! He's behind us.

1275
01:34:43,208 --> 01:34:44,625
-Hurry up!
-Oh, no!

1276
01:34:44,958 --> 01:34:46,041
What do we do now?

1277
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:55,500
-Jock, which way?
-Straight ahead.

1278
01:35:17,791 --> 01:35:19,166
Why is he making so many stops?

1279
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:36,208
Bastard!

1280
01:35:36,375 --> 01:35:37,291
Why didn't you

1281
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:38,791
drive the humvee?

1282
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:41,583
The key is with you.

1283
01:35:41,666 --> 01:35:43,625
Did you think I was going to push it
all the way here?

1284
01:35:48,583 --> 01:35:49,625
Tee, here's your knife.

1285
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:50,958
Wow...

1286
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:08,458
Bastard! You think you're tough?

1287
01:36:08,833 --> 01:36:09,875
Fuck! He's still alive.

1288
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:11,208
Bastard!

1289
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:18,333
Oh! Hey! Wait for me.

1290
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:27,791
Boss, what's going on there?

1291
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:31,541
Rue-Tai.

1292
01:36:34,916 --> 01:36:36,458
Do you really want this CD?

1293
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:41,541
It's because of that fucking CD.

1294
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:45,916
Go to hell, you slut!

1295
01:37:05,625 --> 01:37:07,083
James Bond!

1296
01:37:24,416 --> 01:37:25,875
James Bond. Hold on.

1297
01:37:25,958 --> 01:37:26,958
You're going to be okay.

1298
01:37:27,583 --> 01:37:28,750
-Breathe.
-Hold on, sweetie.

1299
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:29,958
Let's go to the hospital.

1300
01:37:30,041 --> 01:37:31,125
-Go to the hospital.
-Let's go.

1301
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:32,791
-Just breathe.
-Handcuff him.

1302
01:37:33,833 --> 01:37:35,458
Get the gun and take him away.

1303
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:39,250
Let's go.

1304
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:43,458
Get up.

1305
01:38:03,875 --> 01:38:05,583
In the end, everything is all right.

1306
01:38:20,666 --> 01:38:23,791
AYUDHYA BANK

1307
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:28,458
Come on. Pick it up.

1308
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,583
MR. SORN

1309
01:38:32,666 --> 01:38:36,083
There is a car
blocking the front door, sir.

1310
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:38,541
All right. I'll check it out.

1311
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,208
KRUNGSRI AYUTTHAYA BANK

1312
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:08,125
Do you want to rent a room?

1313
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,208
Where is the owner of this room?

1314
01:41:11,625 --> 01:41:13,833
She moved out this morning.

1315
01:41:13,916 --> 01:41:15,416
She said she was heading back home.

1316
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:16,375
She...

1317
01:41:16,916 --> 01:41:19,416
left a lot of things here.

1318
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:24,416
May I have a look inside?

1319
01:41:25,125 --> 01:41:26,583
Yes, go ahead.

1320
01:42:05,083 --> 01:42:07,125
NAM-PAN

1321
01:42:09,916 --> 01:42:11,125
Address confirmed.

1322
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:13,875
The target is with another man.

1323
01:42:15,208 --> 01:42:16,958
Isn't being one man's mistress bad enough?

1324
01:42:17,375 --> 01:42:18,916
Why are you like this?

1325
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:21,291
Why?

1326
01:42:22,583 --> 01:42:23,666
You shouldn't...

1327
01:42:24,416 --> 01:42:25,541
You're kind of cute.

1328
01:42:26,458 --> 01:42:27,458
Damn it!

1329
01:42:31,083 --> 01:42:33,208
One day you will pay the price

1330
01:42:33,291 --> 01:42:34,958
for messing with other people's families.

1331
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,250
Faking innocence.

1332
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:39,958
You are just a mistress.

1333
01:42:45,041 --> 01:42:47,083
I've dreamt of having a house
since I was young.

1334
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:49,625
I can do anything

1335
01:42:49,916 --> 01:42:51,500
to fulfill that dream.

1336
01:42:54,666 --> 01:42:56,666
I never thought

1337
01:42:57,083 --> 01:42:58,708
I would break up other people's families.

1338
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:06,625
Maybe my life being ruined

1339
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:12,041
is the price I have to pay.

1340
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:51,083
This house was Nam-Pan's dream.

1341
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:54,041
I have also designed the house for her.

1342
01:43:57,958 --> 01:43:59,250
NAM-PAN'S HOUSE

1343
01:43:59,416 --> 01:44:00,416
Take a look!

1344
01:44:00,583 --> 01:44:01,541
What do you think?

1345
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:03,708
This is the bedroom.

1346
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:06,625
The roof can also be opened.
She can look at the stars at night.

1347
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:10,166
A living room with a karaoke machine,

1348
01:44:10,875 --> 01:44:12,833
so Jack and Rue-Tai can enjoy singing.

1349
01:44:12,916 --> 01:44:14,166
Like the other night.

1350
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:16,791
A jasmine garden.

1351
01:44:17,166 --> 01:44:18,208
Nam-Pan will like it.

1352
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:20,958
And this house is for you, James Bond.

1353
01:44:21,583 --> 01:44:22,958
But I'm not giving it to you for free.

1354
01:44:23,333 --> 01:44:25,250
Your job is to be a good guard dog, okay?

1355
01:44:32,083 --> 01:44:33,166
James Bond...

1356
01:44:36,666 --> 01:44:38,541
Do you think Nam-Pan would
want to stay in this house?

1357
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,666
Should I remind you what day it is today?

1358
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:32,500
If you still don't have it,
that's all right.

1359
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:34,750
Take your time.

1360
01:45:35,083 --> 01:45:37,625
I'll talk to Madam for you.

1361
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:48,666
Because he was grateful to Jock
for saving his life,

1362
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:51,166
Somsak has changed his attitude.

1363
01:45:51,916 --> 01:45:52,958
This is for you, Mr. Jock.

1364
01:45:53,333 --> 01:45:54,458
Give it a try.

1365
01:46:02,458 --> 01:46:03,375
Rue-Tai

1366
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:05,375
finally got to live her dream.

1367
01:46:05,916 --> 01:46:07,250
-Hey!
-I'm sorry.

1368
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,458
You can have it. I will...

1369
01:46:14,916 --> 01:46:16,833
TO RUE-TAI
FROM PALMY

1370
01:46:16,916 --> 01:46:17,833
MR. MANA

1371
01:46:17,916 --> 01:46:20,458
Jack has become a professional detective.

1372
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,000
Can you handle it?

1373
01:46:22,333 --> 01:46:23,833
Yes, of course.

1374
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:25,875
Jack.

1375
01:46:32,791 --> 01:46:34,125
Thank you so much.

1376
01:46:34,541 --> 01:46:36,625
With such compelling evidence...

1377
01:46:36,916 --> 01:46:39,250
Adisorn and Suwimol
decided to get a divorce

1378
01:46:39,333 --> 01:46:41,541
and divide the properties in half.

1379
01:46:41,625 --> 01:46:43,666
-That's it.
-Thank you.

1380
01:46:44,208 --> 01:46:45,250
Thank you.

1381
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:47,208
As for Madam Saowa...

1382
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:50,791
She has finally found a way
to win her husband's heart.

1383
01:47:01,666 --> 01:47:02,958
Damn!

1384
01:47:03,041 --> 01:47:04,375
They look like shit.

1385
01:47:09,166 --> 01:47:10,208
I guess Jock

1386
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:13,125
wants to go back to fix his past.

1387
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:18,208
Let alone a man...

1388
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:19,458
If a dog like me

1389
01:47:19,541 --> 01:47:20,458
could choose,

1390
01:47:20,666 --> 01:47:22,875
I wouldn't be stupid enough

1391
01:47:22,958 --> 01:47:24,458
to act like a hero by blocking the bullet.

1392
01:47:25,958 --> 01:47:29,208
Anyway, we can't turn back time.

1393
01:47:29,291 --> 01:47:30,875
All we can do is keep moving forward.

1394
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:45,541
Deer, Floating Airport case closed.
Case closed.

1395
01:48:09,041 --> 01:48:11,083
Is the built-in furniture

1396
01:48:11,166 --> 01:48:12,375
in the kitchen included?

1397
01:48:12,458 --> 01:48:14,333
Yes.

1398
01:48:14,416 --> 01:48:16,333
It also comes with all the items
in the house.

1399
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:21,833
I like it.

1400
01:48:21,916 --> 01:48:23,291
It's near our offices.

1401
01:48:23,375 --> 01:48:24,666
Thank you.

1402
01:48:39,291 --> 01:48:40,708
Let's take this house.

1403
01:48:40,791 --> 01:48:42,416
-I like its design.
-It's up to you, then.

1404
01:48:43,166 --> 01:48:44,791
-Do you like it, sweetie?
-Yes, Mom.

1405
01:49:49,916 --> 01:49:51,208
Looking for a house?

1406
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:14,500
Don't ever leave me again.

1407
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:20,833
Thank you, Jock.

1408
01:55:56,916 --> 01:55:58,916
