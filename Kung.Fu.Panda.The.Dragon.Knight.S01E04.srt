Your Highness,
we come before you with terrible tidings.

Okay, yeah. What is it? What is it?

11
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,436
We were collecting criminals
for the daily dungeon roundup,

12
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,021
when we were ambushed.

13
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:03,938
It was…

14
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,940
the Dragon Master.

15
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,069
The former Dragon Master.

It feels like he's attacking me!

18
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,327
Would you agree that an attack on you

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,746
is just as bad as
an attack on me, personally?

20
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,082
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.

21
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,752
Yep, Po is attacking me,
and that means he's attacking China.

22
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,339
I'd give him a pass, but China?
China won't stand for it.

23
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,800
He is the most powerful warrior
in the land.

24
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,468
What can we do against such might?

25
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,720
You shall do nothing.

[atmospheric music plays]

67

[Po] It was the time before times,

still newer than old and new.

-[Po] Doesn't matter. Sounds cool.

70
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,101
[Po] Master Long-Tooth was
one of the most powerful warriors

71
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,686
to fight in the Great War.

72
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,189
She wielded the Whip of Endless Flame,

00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,406
Anyway, she was the coolest.

77

the whole world was broken.

-[atmospheric music plays]
-[rumbling]

79

[Po] She realized that the whip was
too powerful for any warrior to wield.

80
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,839
It had to be destroyed.

81
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,677
That would be her quest,
and her greatest challenge.

82

[Po] The author, Li Gao,

Master Long-Tooth's whip

My dad used to take me
all the time when I was a kid. [sniffs]

358
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,970
He must have known I'd recognize it.

Kill me. Aw, man. [sniffs]

362
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,357
Walk the road south

363
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:51,278
until you see a mountain range
that looks just like this one.

364

I bet you'll find your city.

371
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,387
[chuckles] It was cool
seeing you open up today.

372
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,681
To Lao. To that little girl.

373
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,520
You know, if you ever wanna
talk about stuff with me, you can.

374
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,854
I mean, I'm right here.

375
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,940
What are you scheming?

376
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,024
I mean, I think…

377
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,567
thought…

378
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,111
we were becoming friends?

379
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,281
All that stuff, talking, sharing things
with each other, that's what friends do.

381
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,790
I was eight years old
when my brother died.

382
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,836
He was trying to arrest
Klaus and Veruca, and they--

383
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,631
-They killed him. Right in front of me.
-[soft music plays]

384

I'm finishing what my brother could not.

385
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,678
So I can't be your friend, Po.

386
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,973
Because if I ever had to choose
between you and the mission,

387
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,516
it will be the mission.

388

I'm sorry.

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,149
I'm sorry too.

We are the Forbidden Company,
and you are under arrest,

Dragon Master.

401
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,809
There's no Dragon Master here.
