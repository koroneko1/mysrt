00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.860
<i>‎But there's something about me</i>
<i>‎that no one knows yet.</i>

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.100
<i>‎Because I have a secret.</i>

‎What do you think, Plagg?

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.740
‎ Ugh!

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.580
‎Why give someone something that can't
‎be eaten and doesn't have a scent?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.140
‎If you gave me that,
‎I'd be seriously offended.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.140
‎Maybe I should get a second opinion.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.340
‎-What is it?
‎-It's a gift for Marinette.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.380
‎-It's for a surprise birthday party.
‎-Marinette?

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.340
‎The girl who won the fashion contest.
‎She made the hat I wore at your show.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.420
‎She's awesome. She loves helping--

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.260
‎I don't recall giving you permission
‎to go to her party.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.460
‎Please, Father. Marinette deserves
‎to have all her friends there!

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.980
‎-All right, then.
‎-Thank you, Father.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.860
‎I carry the lucky charm you gave me
‎wherever I go.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.380
‎I think it works pretty well.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.020
‎I thought you were
‎protecting Adrien from Marinette,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.580
‎the one you said was a bad influence.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.340
‎From now on, you and I are at war.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.660
‎You will lose your friends and wind up
‎all alone, and Adrien will soon be mine.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.500
‎We'll see about that, Lila.
‎We'll see.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.060
‎ ‎My plan is taking
‎a little longer than expected, sir.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.340
‎But you won't be disappointed.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.900
‎Will you keep your promise
‎if I succeed?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.540
‎I always honour my commitments.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.420
‎-You work too hard, sir.
‎-Now's not the time to ease up, Nathalie.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.660
‎I'm friends with the best
‎manga publisher in Japan.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.940
‎I could talk to him about your project!

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.540
‎-She's such a liar!
‎-You gotta stop obsessing over her!

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.260
‎I've graded your mock exam papers.
‎Most of you did quite well.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.260
‎Some better than others.
‎But, first, Marinette,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.060
‎could you bring your school bag to me,
‎please? I need to check something.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.940
‎Today, someone placed
‎an anonymous note in my mailbox,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.300
‎claiming that you'd stolen
‎the exam answers.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.300
‎And it looks like
‎the anonymous person was right!

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.540
‎That's not true! Someone must have
‎planted that piece of paper in my bag!

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.700
‎-But you answered everything correctly!
‎-I did?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.580
‎Yes! But because I studied.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.580
‎Miss Bustier, Marinette
‎always scores high on your tests.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.420
‎This is so terribly unlike you.
‎You're usually so well-behaved!

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.820
‎Of course! You put the answers in my bag!
‎You're the anonymous informer!

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.300
‎ I'm coming to your defence
‎and you're accusing me?

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.460
‎You can't accuse someone without proof‎,
‎Marinette‎.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.180
‎But I'm sure it's her!
‎She stole the test answers!

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.020
‎That's impossible, Marinette.
‎Lila got the worst grade in the class.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.820
‎Th... then
‎she flunked the exam on purpose!

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.260
‎ ‎Excuse me, Miss Bustier,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.820
‎but everyone here knows
‎it isn't like Marinette to cheat!

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.060
‎-‎ ‎He's right!
‎-‎ ‎It doesn't make sense!

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.140
‎ ‎She'd never cheat.
‎She doesn't need to.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.460
‎Marinette, Lila,
‎please go to the principal's office

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.620
‎until we get to the bottom of this.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.980
‎ Hm.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.540
‎I swore I'd make your life unbearable,
‎Marinette!

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.820
‎Let's see
‎how you get out of this one.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.140
‎I'm not falling in your trap, Lila!

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.700
‎Too late, you already have!

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.420
‎-Where are you going?
‎-You're about to find out.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.340
‎Ready?

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.500
‎Ouch! Ow! Aaah!

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.820
‎- ‎Ouch, my leg!

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.260
‎What happened over here?

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.700
‎Marinette pushed me down the stairs!

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.860
‎In my office!

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.060
‎ ‎But, sir, it wasn't me!
‎I didn't do anything!

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.740
‎ ‎Why doesn't she like me?

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.860
‎I've tried to be her friend,
‎but she keeps calling me a liar,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.700
‎getting the others to gang up against me

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.060
‎and now she's pushing me
‎down the stairs? Ow!

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.580
‎Those are total lies!

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.420
‎Go on, Lila.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.060
‎She even took a necklace

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.900
‎I got from my grandmother, a fox pendant.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.660
‎Took? As in stole?

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.180
‎That's not true! I never stole anything!

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.420
‎-My daughter is not a thief!
‎-Why should we believe any of this?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.420
‎You're accusing her without proof!

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.860
‎Oh...

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.940
‎I have proof.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.620
‎Open your locker, please.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.580
‎-‎ ‎My grandma's pendant!

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.380
‎She's making up this whole thing!
‎It wasn't me!

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.140
‎-‎I didn't do anything, I swear!
‎-Oh!

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.780
‎You know Lila's lying,
‎don't you, Adrien?

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.980
‎-Mr Damocles, I don't think...
‎-Marinette Dupain-Cheng,

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.620
‎-you are expelled from this school!
‎- Oh!

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.500
‎Lila Rossi was right.
‎This was worth the wait.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.300
‎The downfall of Marinette brings about
‎the despair of everyone who trusted her.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.380
‎I can feel the huge waves of negative
‎emotions as they come crashing down.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.220
‎Are you ready, Nathalie?

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.660
‎More than ever.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.900
‎Catalyst, I'm giving you back the power
‎to transform me into Scarlet Moth!

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.220
‎From now on,
‎you are the almighty Scarlet Moth!

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.300
‎Thanks to you, I can now release
‎as many akumas as I desire!

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.860
‎Ah! Fly away, my little akumas!

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.460
‎Find Marinette and her friends,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.100
‎and evilise them all!

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.100
‎ ‎Verity Queen!
‎Princess Justice!

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.820
‎I am Scarlet Moth.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.380
‎Since the innocent
‎isn't to be believed any more,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.620
‎I'm giving you both the power
‎to expose the truth!

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.460
‎As for you, my desperate, loyal ones,
‎disappointed by she

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.860
‎who you once admired so much,

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.900
‎I'm glad to have you back!

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.820
‎In return, you will bring me
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.020
‎-What's wrong?
‎-Nothing.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.220
‎-Everything's fine.
‎-Dark wings fall!

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.180
‎ ‎If you'd been akumatised,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.580
‎you'd have handed over
‎your Miraculous to Hawk Moth.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.100
‎There would have been no more Ladybug.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.020
‎-We can't let that happen!
‎-Neither Lila nor Hawk Moth will win!

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.940
‎I'll prove my innocence!
‎If only ‎Alya ‎could ‎help‎ me‎.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.820
‎Alya didn't become akumatised
‎earlier today at school.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.220
‎I'm sure it's because she trusts you.
‎Call her!

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.540
‎You're right!

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.940
‎<i>‎So, let's recap.</i>

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.860
<i>‎You're accused</i>
<i>‎of stealing the test answers.</i>

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.740
<i>‎Evidence one. The answers</i>
<i>‎were found in your school bag.</i>

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.260
<i>‎You're accused of pushing Lila downstairs.</i>
<i>‎No one witnessed this,</i>

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.620
<i>‎but everyone did see Lila on the floor.</i>

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.380
<i>‎You're also accused of stealing Lila's</i>
<i>‎necklace, which was found in your locker.</i>

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.300
<i>‎And you have a motive. I know for a fact</i>
<i>‎that you've hated Lila from day one</i>

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.060
<i>‎because she hangs around Adrien.</i>

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.820
‎ ‎I'm so glad I called you.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.420
‎-Thanks for your support.
<i>‎-You're my best friend.</i>

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.380
<i>‎I believe you,</i>
<i>‎but the evidence is stacked against you.</i>

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.820
<i>‎The good thing is, the greatest reporters</i>
<i>‎always seek the truth.</i>

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.300
<i>‎So, I'm going to prove your innocence!</i>

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.020
‎Phew! Thanks, Al!

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.900
<i>‎First off, a culprit always leaves clues.</i>

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.060
<i>‎Following these clues will lead us...</i>

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.420
‎To Lila!

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.220
<i>‎No! To the guilty party!</i>

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.260
<i>‎If you're quick to accuse Lila,</i>
<i>‎you might overlook others.</i>

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.540
‎Oh... Right.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.460
<i>‎Whoever it was</i>
<i>‎had to have touched your locker</i>

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.420
<i>‎when they put the necklace in.</i>
<i>‎I'll check for fingerprints!</i>

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.380
‎-Marinette, can we have a word?
‎-I'll meet you later.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.980
‎Now, listen, honey. We love you,
‎but this has gotten very complicated.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.740
‎Until we've found a new school,
‎we've decided you should help us here.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.420
‎But I'm telling you, I didn't do anything!
‎If I have to spend my time here,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.060
‎how can I prove I'm innocent?

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.220
‎It's fun here in the bakery, you'll see!

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.940
‎Once again, Mr Agreste,
‎make sure she gets lots of rest.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.260
‎Of course. Thank you, Doctor!

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.980
‎Perhaps you can still take advantage
‎of the chaos that Lila has wreaked.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.660
‎That plan is pointless without you.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.780
‎You're right.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.420
‎ ‎Then I have to...

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.740
‎There will be no more Catalyst,
‎or Mayura.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.220
‎ ‎I warned you, using a broken
‎Miraculous ends up breaking its wearer.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.100
‎The wounds on the Miraculous
‎are becoming your wounds.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.460
‎I don't care, Gabriel. I want to help you.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.700
‎Not at that cost.
‎Never at that cost again.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.220
‎Shh!

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.060
‎Woohoo! Yay!
‎You're feeling better already!

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.380
‎-Oh, no! Spoke too soon.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.300
‎-But then... what are we doing here?
‎-Gabriel would never allow me to do this,

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.980
‎but I'll create
‎a very powerful Sentimonster,

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.300
‎the most powerful that's ever existed.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.020
‎No, don't do that! You should be resting!

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.380
‎Gabriel so desperately
‎wants the Miraculous

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.980
‎and I'll give it to him.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.540
‎Boohoo! It's so romantic!

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.420
‎Duusuu, spread my feathers!

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.540
‎Go, my beautiful amok,
‎and bring my creation to life.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.540
‎Ladybug, I am Mayura.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.780
‎You are Cat Noir's true teammate
‎and you've one goal,

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.100
‎to get hold of the Miraculous!

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.820
‎I'm ready, Mayura.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.620
‎Always make sure you've got your right
‎angles. There!

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.500
‎Then, you fold the pastry towards you
‎first, about two-thirds of the way...

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.180
‎Can I please answer?

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.620
‎We're not done with our flaky pastry yet.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.100
‎<i>‎It's Marinette! Leave a message!</i>

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.900
‎OK, so here's the skinny
‎on my investigation so far.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.340
‎No fingerprints, no evidence.
‎Whoever did this was very thorough.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.660
‎I'm sorry. We'll be in touch.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.060
‎<i>‎I'm live from the Arc de Triomphe,</i>
<i>‎where Ladybug is battling</i>

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.540
<i>‎against </i>‎a new supervillain.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.500
<i>‎I am Mayura,</i>

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.980
<i>‎and I'm about to annihilate Ladybug!</i>

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.940
‎Don't tell me.
‎We have to go and help your lady!

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.580
‎She and I are a team, Plagg!

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.900
‎We'll help Marinette, but first...
‎Plagg, claws out!

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.700
‎-Cat Noir to the rescue, milady!
‎-Pretend to be hurt!

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.900
‎ ‎Aaah!

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.660
‎Milady! No!

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.460
‎ ‎Ladybug is fighting a villain

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.580
‎at the Arc de Triomphe.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.980
‎ ‎Isn't Cat Noir with her?

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.740
‎What's this about Ladybug and Mayura?

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.780
‎-It must be one of Hawk Moth's traps!
‎-Must get there before he gets tricked!

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.940
‎Ha, ha! Oh! I'm such a klutz!
‎Can I go change my clothes, Dad?

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.740
‎No need, sweetie. Don't worry.
‎A good baker's never afraid to get dirty!

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.340
‎You can change after you're done
‎decorating these gingerbread men.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.060
‎-You OK?
‎-Don't worry about me. Go after Mayura!

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.940
‎Ow! Ow!

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.420
‎Cat Noir, I don't feel so good.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.980
‎There's something wrong.
‎We're supposed to be nearly invulnerable.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.100
‎He doesn't suspect a thing!
‎Grab his Miraculous, his ring,

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.780
‎before the real Ladybug gets here.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.820
‎Cat Noir, don't leave me.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.460
‎What... What's going on?

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.260
‎I've gone out of my way
‎to hide my feelings for you,

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.940
‎but I just can't do it anymore.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.500
‎But I thought you said
‎you loved somebody else!

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.580
‎It's... It's over.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.860
‎After all this time, I've realised...

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.820
‎You're always here for me,
‎even when I keep rejecting you.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.020
‎Your feelings for me haven't changed
‎and mine are growing stronger every day.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.820
‎I can't keep pretending any more.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:35.740
‎Now!

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.460
‎ ‎Watch it, Cat Noir,

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.460
‎you're confusing fantasy with reality!

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.860
‎-You're not Ladybug?
‎-No, she's not me!

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.420
‎She's manipulating you. You know
‎I'm ‎already ‎in love with someone else.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.900
‎-Listen to your heart!
‎-No, listen to your brain!

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.500
‎You're just an illusion!

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.020
‎See? I'm real enough!

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.740
‎Impossible!
‎There can't be two Ladybugs!

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.380
‎She must be a fan‎...

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.100
‎A‎kumatised by Hawk Moth!

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.620
‎Don't fall for her tricks!

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.860
‎-Milady, no!
‎-We've got a villain to fight!

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.580
‎-We'll take care of me later!
‎-That's the lady I know!

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.980
‎Ugh! I can't believe you fell for that!

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.500
‎OK! Good job, you win!
‎I am the fake Ladybug.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.620
‎But there's no way
‎I'm letting you cataclysm my earrings!

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.220
‎What? Why does she... ?

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.100
‎You wanna bet?

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.220
‎-Over to you, Cat Noir!
‎-Cata...

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.860
‎No! Not the earrings!

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.460
‎-Hello, Mayura!
‎-Huh?

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.380
‎Mayura? But‎...

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.060
‎S‎he looked so real!

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.060
‎Things aren't always what they seem!

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.020
‎This Ladybug isn't an illusion
‎or an akumatised person.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.100
‎-Uh-uh! She's a Sentimonster!
‎-But she's so much more elaborate.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.100
‎So perfect! There's nothing monstrous
‎about her at all!

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.980
‎Sorry, kitty, but you should have known.
‎I'm nowhere near as perfect as her!

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.220
‎I love you just the way you are, milady!

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.460
‎Got a hint of where the amok is...
‎Look at what Mayura's holding!

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.740
‎Whatever it takes,
‎steal their Miraculous from them!

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.500
‎Senticharm!

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.420
‎-Whoa!
‎-I'll show you a real... Lucky Charm!

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.340
‎OK! You're definitely the real one!

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.820
‎Hey! Help me! I'm stuck!

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.140
‎Nathalie!

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.220
‎Nooroo! Why didn't you wake me up?

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.860
‎I couldn't bring myself to, Master.
‎You were sleeping so peacefully.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.340
‎Mayura looks exhausted.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.580
‎It's our chance to find out
‎who's beneath the mask!

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.020
‎Cover your ears!

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.220
‎No!

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.740
‎-What's going on?
‎-You're right.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.740
‎There's nothing monstrous about her.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.380
‎Whoever owns this controls her.
‎She couldn't help but follow orders.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.580
‎Sentimonster, you're free now!
‎I won't give you orders.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.580
‎But I ask you,
‎help us grab Mayura's Miraculous!

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.140
‎Thank you, Ladybug. I will help you!

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.780
‎Are we cool or are we cool? We could call
‎ourselves "Cat Noir and his Ladybugs"!

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.740
‎I prefer "The Bugettes and Kitty Cat"!
‎What do you think?

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.980
‎-You're in charge, Ladybug!
‎- I should have guessed!

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.180
‎ I release you,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.540
‎from existence.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.180
‎How could you?

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.700
‎-Getting sentimental on a sentimonster?
‎-Hawk Moth!

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.060
‎You're the real monster!

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.580
‎Oh, that you'll find out very soon!

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.540
‎We missed you, Grandpa! You don't mind me
‎calling you Grandpa, right?

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.060
‎You won't be joking around
‎when I take your Miraculous!

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.740
‎Cat Noir, cover me!

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.380
‎ Check, Ladybug!

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.420
‎-No!
‎-Cataclysm!

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.100
‎Good move, kitty! Now all I have to do is
‎grab Mayura's Miraculous and it's over.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.220
‎Checkmate! You'd better surrender!

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.420
‎Ha, ha, ha!
‎All I need to do is wait a few minutes

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.740
‎until you and your pet
‎transform back into regular kids,

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.420
‎so fragile, so easy to break!

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.500
‎-Release him!
‎-Release her!

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.180
‎-Don't mind me!
‎-Don't listen‎ to him‎!

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:04.220
‎You had Mayura right where you wanted her.
‎I could've managed! Why did you do that?

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.940
‎Because we're Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.420
‎"Ladybug" by itself
‎doesn't sound half as cool!

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.420
‎You shouldn't say things like that to me!

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.820
‎But the real Ladybug's heart
‎still belongs to someone else.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.020
‎Ha! I should have guessed that too!

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.620
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.300
‎I guess even that
‎can't bring our bugette back.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.980
‎Peacock's superpower
‎can be so cruel when wrongly used.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.020
‎Even more than the butterfly's one.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.300
‎You've disobeyed me again, Nathalie,
‎and put yourself in danger for nothing.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.740
‎Your idea was brilliant, but you don't
‎need a Miraculous to help me.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.340
‎There was something else you needed
‎Mayura for, to find the Guardian.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.620
‎I'm not so sure anymore.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.580
‎If you ever need Mayura again,
‎I'll be here for you.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.820
‎-Thank you.
‎-Oh, Adriano, <i>‎come stai</i>‎?

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.700
‎I'm good, thanks, Giuseppe.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.060
‎-Lila?
‎-Do you know each other?

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.300
‎Oh, man, your papa's new muse
‎is incredible!

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.140
‎She's been all around the world,
‎she knows everyone

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.540
‎-and she's Italian, just like me!
‎-Hi, Adrien!

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.420
‎You're gonna give me tons of tips,
‎because I'm not as experienced as you are!

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.180
‎Would you mind
‎leaving us alone for a second?

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.100
‎Sure.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.460
‎I warned you once already,
‎but you didn't listen.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.660
‎You hurt Marinette and that's not OK.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.620
‎Me? Hurting Marinette?
‎But she's the one...

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.300
‎I can't prove you lied,
‎because you're good at it.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.060
‎So you'll have to come up
‎with another convincing lie,

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.540
‎only, this time,
‎it'll prove Marinette's innocent.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.580
‎Why would I do that, Adrien?

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.820
‎Because we're friends, aren't we?

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:10.100
‎And because of this rare disease,
‎sometimes I can't control things I say.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.020
‎I'm really sorry, Marinette.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.980
‎Thank you for your confession, Lila.
‎It's very moving!

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.020
‎Marinette, you will of course be allowed
‎back in school tomorrow.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.300
‎People should know things
‎aren't always what they seem.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.100
‎So... Look, I don't know why
‎you felt the urge to start all this,

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.460
‎or why all of a sudden
‎you lied to fix this mess,

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.100
‎but I'm glad you're capable of
‎coming back to your senses, sometimes.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.780
‎As you said, things aren't always
‎what they seem to be at first sight.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.620
‎I knew my daughter
‎was innocent all along!

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.660
‎Oh! Aren't those your classmates?

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.780
<i>‎This week, we'll visit the set of</i>
<i>‎Gabriel Agreste's latest photoshoot</i>

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.940
<i>‎for an exclusive interview</i>
