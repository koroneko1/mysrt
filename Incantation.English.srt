NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:30,958
Do you…

3
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,875
Do you believe
in such things as blessings?

4
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,958
Say, for instance,
wishing on your birthday,

5
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,916
or wishing someone safe travels,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,416
or maybe even,
wishing Merry Christmas, or the like.

7
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,875
It may be just a thought

8
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,041
or perhaps even a reminder.

9
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,666
The fact is, involuntarily
and quite unconsciously,

10
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,875
we believe our will
can bring about good outcomes.

11
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,375
But do you know that your will can
actually change the outcomes of events?

12
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,416
Let's do an experiment now.

13
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:13,291
Please use your mind to move the rotation
of the Ferris wheel to the right.

14
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,250
Now to the left.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,125
To the left.

16
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,333
To the right.

17
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,500
To the left.

18
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,666
To the right.

19
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,208
The direction of this moving train

20
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,791
can also be either moving forward
or backward based on your will.

21
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,791
Now I want you to try to control it
only with your mind.

22
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,291
Did you see that?

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,291
Our will is quietly shaping this world.

24
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,541
This is how blessings work.

25
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,583
My name is Li Ronan.

26
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,875
Six years ago,
I violated a terrifying taboo.

27
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,791
Back then, anyone fortunate enough
to come close to this matter,

28
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,666
was befallen with misfortunes
I can't explain.

29
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,916
MOM AND DAD.MP4

30
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,375
What deity are you talking about?

31
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,083
Did you watch what's on that camera?

32
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,375
Didn't the master instruct us

33
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,125
-not to listen, look, and ask anything?
-Master, master, please.

34
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,333
-And you kept asking questions.
-You have to believe everything he says?

35
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,708
And with this curse,

36
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:52,250
the more you understand it,
the more you'd be affected by its power.

37
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,041
I am Li Kuo-sheng.

38
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,291
No!

39
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,208
I actually made this video because,

40
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:37,458
I'm hoping that everyone can help
resolve my daughter's misfortune.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,625
If you're willing to keep watching,

42
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,875
just in case you'll be able to help,

43
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,458
please look at this symbol until,

44
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,250
until you've memorized it.

45
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,125
Ten.

46
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,166
Nine.

47
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,125
Eight.

48
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,416
Seven.

49
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Six.

50
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,708
Five.

51
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,083
Four.

52
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,250
Three.

53
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,333
Two.

54
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,375
One.

55
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,541
And if you can,

56
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,583
please recite this with me.

57
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,041
Doing it in your mind is fine too.

58

HOU-HO-XIU-YI, SI-SEI-WU-MA

Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

60
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,333
Hi, Dodo.

61
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,875
Hello, Dodo.

62
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,083
Hi-lo, Dodo.

63
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,750
Uh, hello,
this here is a new camera I bought

64
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:38,833
I…

65
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,750
Oh, this is not bad at all.

66
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,666
It's better than I expected.

67
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,291
Here, good job.

68
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,416
Hey, congratulations.

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,125
You can finally bring Dodo home next week.

70
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,791
Thanks so much.

71
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,250
What are you filming?

72
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,416
Oh, it's nothing.

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,041
I just want to record the time
that Dodo is here.

74
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,708
And maybe turn it into a sort of diary
documenting her new life.

75
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,458
Aah.

76
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,166
Listen, I hope you don't think
I'm being nosy.

77
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,666
I know that you're Dodo's mother.

78
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,916
But if you don't pass
the evaluation period,

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,625
it's unlikely that the court
will grant you custody.

80
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,625
And besides, you still have that record
from your past.

81
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,916
Don't worry, I'll cooperate.

82
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,916
You better do that.

83
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,875
Oh, wait. How do I turn this on?

84
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,541
Oh, uh… you didn't switch it off before,
so you can just keep filming.

85
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,208
Why aren't you smiling?

86
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,916
Come on over here.

87
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,583
Take a peek, come on, see. There.

88
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,625
Okay, I can film from here.

89
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,125
Why don't you go in and play with them?
Give that to me.

90
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,416
Okay, I'll go in first then.

91
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,375
Yes, go ahead.

92
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,416
-Hello.
-Oh, hi, hi. Hello there.

93
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,208
Ronan?

94
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,791
Yeah, that's right, I'm Ronan.

95
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,083
Come on. Why don't you stand up,

96
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,416
-Dodo and greet your mom?
-Hi.

97
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,375
I'm Ming, hello.

98
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,125
Have you heard
of the New Life Diary before?

99
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,250
"New Life Diary"?

100
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,500
You see, um…

101
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,250
I'm just filming this as a memento.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,833
Um, hey Dodo, say hi to your mom. Come on.

103
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,541
It's… It's okay. This…

104
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,125
This is for you.

105
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,416
Wow! Go ahead and say thank you, Dodo.

106
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,916
-Thank you, thank you so much.
-No…

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,958
Let me go over there.

108
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,083
This lighting is good.

109
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,625
So, we're recording
a "New Life Diary" for Dodo.

110
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,791
Yes, as a memento.

111
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,041
Ah, right.

112
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,500
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.

113
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,958
Why do you want to run a foster home?

114
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,833
I never really thought about it.

115
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,000
Well, perhaps…

116
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,083
Perhaps it's to um…

117
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,041
Mm…

118
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,291
Perhaps it's because I've always wanted
to know what being a father feels like.

119
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,000
-I see.
-Mm.

120
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,583
-Do you want to bring me there?
-Yes, that's right. Come on, let's go.

121
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,708
-Okay.
-Come on, come on.

122
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,291
Ms. Hsia, how much of this
will you be filming?

123
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,625
-So, you…
-Until the battery runs out.

124
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,916
Is that your camera, Ronan?

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,166
Yes, I just bought it.

126
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,166
Aah.

127
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,458
Um, Dodo.

128
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,958
Is this your favorite toy, huh?

129
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:04,958
Mm-hm.

130
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,541
-Wow. And what's its name?
-Mm.

131
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,666
Woofy.

132
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,583
-Sit properly, Dodo. Mm.
-Dodo, sit up.

133
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,750
Mommy, is it okay if we take
Woofy home with us?

134
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,000
Mm…

135
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,125
-Sure, yes.
-Hey, Dodo.

136
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,250
Listen to me.

137
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,125
Let's keep Woofy here, is that okay?

138
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,708
Because we have to keep him here
for the other kids.

139
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,500
But this is daddy's promise.

140
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,166
I promise, that we will keep looking
for new Woofies.

141
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,291
Okay?

142
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,208
Do we have a deal? Hmm?

143
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,916
So, do we have a deal?

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,083
Let's see it.

145
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,208
She's different.

146
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,583
Dodo is special.

147
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,666
She would call me Daddy.

148
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,125
The other kids don't do that.

149
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,291
SIX YEARS AGO

150
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,875
Miss Li Ronan.

151
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,500
I'd like to inform you
that for follow-up purposes,

152
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,625
we will be recording this session.

153
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,333
Sure.

154
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:20,708
FOOTAGE FROM DR. WU
NEW-EAST MENTAL INSTITUTION

155
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

156
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:27,666
So, you think that this um…
"tunnel that you must not enter"

157
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:32,250
has brought misfortune
to those around you.

158
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,291
Is that right?

159
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,708
Yes.

160
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,500
Then based on what you're saying,

161
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,750
did the baby you were carrying…

162
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,541
die?

163
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,916
I gave her away.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,916
I'm just a little curious.
Can you explain

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
why nothing has happened
to you and your baby?

166
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,958
Because I remember you mentioned before

167
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,166
that knowing too much
would bring certain misfortune.

168
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,083
Yes.

169
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,458
And you'll die if you answer your name.

170
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,958
Even just watching the video
filmed inside this tunnel

171
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,208
would kill you.

172
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,791
All I know about…

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,416
about this deity…

174
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,375
…is that the more you understand about it,

175
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,875
the more likely
you'll encounter misfortune.

176
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,250
Huh?

177
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,416
Ooh…

178
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,000
Come…

179
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,541
I feel embarrassed because…

180
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,625
-…there's so many of you.
-It's fine.

181
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,458
-It's okay.
-Don't worry.

182
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,041
Is the watermelon sweet?

183
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,416
Yes!

184
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,916
Is this a photo or video?

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
-Oh, is that it?
-The setting is wrong?

186
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,125
-You're moving to a new home.
-Be careful, all right.

187
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,250
The… the key.

188
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,625
-Hey, what's wrong?
-Do you have it, Ms. Li?

189
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,958
-Do you have the key?
-Yes, but I didn't lock it.

190
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,041
Bye-bye.

191
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,250
-Let me take a look.
-No, there's no need.

192
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,583
Oh, you're unbelievable. Really.

193
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,791
It's okay, it's here. It's in the car.

194
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,416
You're so forgetful.

195
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,750
It's okay, don't worry.

196
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,500
Always listen
to your mom, okay?

197
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,541
-Okay, I will.
-Okay. Very good.

198
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,750
-Are you ready? Here we go!
-Behave, okay.

199
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,416
-Bye!
-Goodbye!

200
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,000
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

201
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,750
Oh, hold on.

202
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,833
Hey.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,875
What?

204
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,000
Aren't you forgetting something important?

205
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,166
Ms. Hsia, thank you so much. Thank you.

206
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,291
There's a bread store right over there.

207
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,791
Is there a kind of bread
that you like eating, huh?

208
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,125
Um…

209
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,166
Dodo, do you like eating bread?

210
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,041
I like everything.

211
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah?

212
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,791
You like everything? That's great.

213
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,750
Hello there. Today is the first day
in our new home.

214
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,583
Let me.

215
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,000
You have to flip it around, like so.

216
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,708
Can you see me now?

217
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,666
Yeah?

218
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,625
And this here is your room.

219
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,500
Ta-da!

220
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,583
Do you like it?

221
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,833
Mommy, why are we filming all of this?

222
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,208
Oh…

223
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:40,125
Because, you know Mommy used to be sick
and I couldn't look after you.

224
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:44,125
But now that I'm fine and well,
we can finally be together.

225
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,875
That's why I want to record this

226
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,500
so we can watch it together
when you grow up.

227
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,458
Okay?

228
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay.

229
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,333
All right.

230
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,625
How about I teach you
how to write your name?

231
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,500
-Mm.
-Let's write a very fat name.

232
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,458
-Okay!
-Okay.

233
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,875
Chen…

234
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,583
Le…

235
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,041
Tung.

236
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,583
Okay. Come on.

237
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,250
Let's show it to the camera.

238
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,916
See this right here,
that's Dodo's full name.

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,666
-Read it with me. Okay?
-Mm.

240
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,750
"Chen Le-tung."

241
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,541
"Chen Le-tung."

242
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,500
Okay, good. Let's read it again
using a fat voice.

243
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,083
"Chen Le-tung."

244
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,916
-"Chen Le-tung."
-"Chen Le-tung."

245
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,750
Wait here, okay? Don't go anywhere.

246
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,416
Did I touch your eye?

247
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,083
Did I? Does it hurt?

248
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,708
Yes, that's right, look up.

249
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,666
What's this?

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,625
Today is the very first day of Dodo
staying in our new home.

251
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,416
She just fell asleep.

252
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,791
She smiled at me today.

253
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,833
So, I feel like
I must have done pretty well.

254
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,000
Well, at least I hope I did.

255
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,458
Hmm?

256
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,208
Is anybody there?

257
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,041
Dodo.

258
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,166
Dodo?

259
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,791
Dodo?

260
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,833
Dodo!

261
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,125
Dodo?

262
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,625
Chen Le-tung.

263
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,250
Chen Le-tung.

264
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,458
Chen Le-tung.

265
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,291
Chen Le-tung.

266
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,000
Dodo.

267
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,375
Chen Le-tung.

268
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,000
Do…

269
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,291
Chen Le-tung…

270
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,375
Chen Le-tung…

271
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,583
Chen Le-tung.

272
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,875
Chen Le-tung.

273
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,208
Dodo!

274
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,666
Dodo! Dodo.

275
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,333
Dodo, Dodo, what's the matter?

276
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,000
Dodo, Dodo, look at me.
Dodo. Look at me, Dodo!

277
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,000
Dodo!

278
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,416
Dodo, it's okay. I'm here, Dodo.

279
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,250
Mommy's here, you're safe.

280
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,916
It's all right, I'm here.

281
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,125
GHOST BUSTERS (SIX YEARS AGO)

282
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,833
What are you doing?

283
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,625
You look so ugly.

284
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,208
Up yours. Hmm.

285
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:07,041
45% COMPLETE
STRANGE MURMURS CHANNEL

286
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,458
Hi and welcome
to the Strange Murmurs Channel.

287
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm Yuan.

288
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,291
Um… my name is Ronan.

289
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,708
He's Dom, an NTU student.

290
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,958
He's Dom.

291
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,333
And we are now driving
on a strange mountain.

292
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,125
And currently,
there is no phone signal at all.

293
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,708
How can the "tunnel you must
not enter" have a phone signal?

294
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,958
Are you serious?

295
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,166
Okay then.

296
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,875
In this episode, we, the Ghost Busters,

297
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,958
will take all of you to see,
the tunnel that has no phone signal

298
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,708
at all and must not be entered.

299
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,958
So, loyal viewers.

300
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,875
Are you ready
to bust this superstition with us?

301
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,041
-Go!
-Go!

302
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,625
Aah!

303
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,625
-What's the matter?
-What happened?

304
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,041
Fuck!

305
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,000
Fuck, what the hell is this?

306
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:48,916
Huh?

307
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,125
Do you see it?

308
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,708
Oh, fuck.

309
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,041
What the hell is this?

310
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,041
What is this?

311
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,000
A Buddha statue?

312
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,375
Looks like it.

313
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,291
What did you say Granduncle
and the others worship?

314
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,583
Uh… I think they worship…

315
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:11,041
A Mother-Buddha or celestial being
or something. I don't really know.

316
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,791
Mother-Buddha? It's female?

317
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,000
What's wrong?

318
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,916
-Are you okay?
-She's possessed.

319
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,541
Has it started?

320
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,541
-Shut up.
-Has it started so soon?

321
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,916
-Are you okay?
-Hey viewers, take a look!

322
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,083
She's being possessed live on camera.

323
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,500
-Tell us how you feel.
-You're so annoying!

324
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,416
Fuck! That's a lot.

325
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,708
-Ooh.
-Careful, bro.

326
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,333
Don't worry, it's fine.

327
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,958
Is that Granduncle?

328
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,708
Yeah.

329
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,500
A-Dom, A-Yuan.

330
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,750
-Granduncle.
-Long time no see. You're both so big now.

331
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,750
-This isn't easy to find, right?
-Yeah, very difficult.

332
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:03,916
And this is?

333
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,083
She's not from our family, right?

334
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,291
No, she's not.

335
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,333
-A-Yuan.
-Hmm?

336
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,625
What are you filming?

337
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,708
Oh, no, nothing, it's a toy.

338
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,958
See, I just bought it.

339
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,666
I might not have been
clear with you on the phone.

340
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,416
This is a private family ritual.

341
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,750
We do not allow outsiders to participate.

342
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,875
But Granduncle, she's not an outsider.

343
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,666
She's his girlfriend.

344
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,625
-Yes, that's right.
-I'm his girlfriend.

345
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,708
Ah, miss. Do you know how to drive?

346
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,208
Maybe you can just come back

347
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,583
after we're finished.

348
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,375
-Huh?
-What do you mean?

349
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,000
I've never driven alone before.

350
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,625
You can work it out amongst yourselves.

351
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,125
You want her to drive down by herself,
Granduncle?

352
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,458
-Uh, hey, wait. Uh…
-Who's this old woman?

353
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,625
What is she doing?
Why does she keep staring at me?

354
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,583
-I don't know. Who is she?
-What's going on right now?

355
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,500
Who is she?

356
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,791
I told you to ask,
but you wouldn't. Now, look.

357
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,083
How would I know?

358
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,958
Granduncle.

359
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,958
Ah, miss, if you don't mind.

360
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,708
Can we take a look at your hand?

361
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,250
-Her hand?
-My hand?

362
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,291
-You must be tired after all that driving.
-I'm exhausted.

363
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,375
Go take a shower. It's your first time.
You can worship first.

364
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,666
So early?

365
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,958
Didn't you say we'll do it
in the middle of the night?

366
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,458
We have to pray again later.

367
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,541
-A-Dom, listen.
-Yeah?

368
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,833
The one who felt
your girlfriend's hand just now

369
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,791
is the Chen family's
most senior Great-aunt.

370
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:48,791
Aah…

371
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,375
-I'm sorry.
-She always going on

372
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,833
about Su-e's two sons.

373
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,791
-Great-aunt is over there.
-Okay.

374
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:01,791
Great-aunt.

375
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,958
These are Su-e's sons.

376
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,500
The most
handsome ones in the Chen family.

377
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,875
-How are you, Great-aunt?
-Greet your Great-aunt.

378
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,625
A-Yuan, what are you doing?
What is there to film at home?

379
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:16,541
Oh, it's nothing.

380
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,333
Granduncle,
isn't that a tunnel over there?

381
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:22,666
Ah, you. Listen to me.
We're here to worship, not play around.

382
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,916
-Hey, which brand is this, huh?
-Hmm?

383
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,958
It's so amazing.

384
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,166
What do you mean?

385
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,666
Even my nose looks sharper.

386
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,625
All done.

387
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,041
What's it like to have your daughter back?

388
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,791
Pretty good. It's all going well.

389
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,458
Hey. What are these?

390
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,250
Bugs?

391
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:46,583
Will you stop messing around?
Come here and get to work.

392
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,375
There are bugs here.
Look, they're all over.

393
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,708
What are you…

394
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,750
Hey. The bag!
They're inside the bag.

395
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,041
That's so gross.

396
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,583
Oh, gross.

397
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,875
-It's on your shirt!
-Where is it? Where is it!

398
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,583
Right there, do you see it?

399
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,333
Oh, no. You crushed it.

400
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,958
-Hello?
-That's dirty. How gross!

401
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,416
Yes, right, this is she.

402
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,333
Um…

403
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh, hi. Hello, ma'am.

404
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,166
-Where? Where does it hurt?
-Dodo.

405
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,958
-Come on, tell me.
-Come out.

406
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,958
-Okay, Dodo? Come, apologize to him.
-Chang Che-wei, what's the matter?

407
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,333
-Apply some medicine for him, okay?
-It's okay. It's okay, it's fine now.

408
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,208
-Let's put medicine on it.
-Come on, Dodo.

409
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,125
Dodo.

410
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,291
Come on.

411
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,416
Oh dear, watch your head. Where's her mom?

412
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,958
-Hey, you're really leaving?
-Okay, sure. Don't worry.

413
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,416
-Thanks. Have you seen my keys?
-Did you tell Ms. Sung?

414
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
How would I know where your keys are?

415
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,500
-You should at least inform her.
-Help me out, okay? Cover for me, please.

416
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,708
-Thank you. Thanks.
-Help you with what?

417
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,125
-Thanks.
-Hey, Ronan!

418
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,208
Stop messing around!

419
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,166
It's all right, don't worry.

420
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,583
She's in the car with me.
We're heading home now.

421
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,291
Hey, drive safely, okay?

422
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,625
I know you're very busy.

423
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,958
And if Dodo needs anything,

424
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:14,208
make sure you let me know. Okay?

425
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,041
I hate going to kindergarten.

426
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,291
Why is that?

427
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,916
Because Chang Che-wei in my class
keeps teasing me.

428
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,833
Why does he keep teasing you?

429
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,583
He says that I'm crazy.

430
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,583
Crazy?

431
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,250
I heard Dodo
bit someone at school.

432
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,458
How could this happen?

433
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,333
She never did that
at the foster home or our center.

434
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,375
I find this rather strange.

435
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,958
Are you in some kind of trouble?

436
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:46,875
You're ridiculous.

437
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:49,000
How could you leave
without informing the client?

438
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:51,875
Did you know that Ms. Sung
had to do her own makeup today?

439
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,333
Listen, she's looking for you now.
You're on your own.

440
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,416
I've recovered. I'm not scared anymore.

441
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,875
One, two, three.

442
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:15,041
As long as I don't worry,
there's no need to worry.

443
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,833
Yes. Right.

444
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,500
I have long recovered.

445
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,875
Amitābha. Amitābha.

446
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,666
Please deliver me from evil.

447
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,333
-Ami…
-Start cleaning.

448
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,666
Please move the base
to a new location to start.

449
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,083
Come down!

450
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,375
Come down!

451
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,958
Mommy!

452
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,375
Mommy!

453
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,375
-What is it, Dodo?
-There's a baddie.

454
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,166
-Who? You said…
-Up there.

455
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,708
Nothing's there.

456
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,875
Where's… where's the baddie?

457
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:01,666
It's right up there! Tell it to come down.

458
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,916
Okay.

459
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,708
All right, hang on, okay?

460
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:13,958
Baddie!

461
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,208
Come down. Hurry up, baddie.

462
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,500
You have to lead it out
by the hand.

463
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,375
Okay. Well…

464
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:27,875
Have I got its hand now?

465
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,208
Higher.

466
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:32,958
What about now?

467
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,041
Higher. A bit higher.

468
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,958
Oh, have I got its hand now, huh?

469
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,041
Have I?

470
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:47,958
Huh?

471
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,875
You got it.

472
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,416
Okay.

473
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,791
Then…

474
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,875
We're going now. Okay?

475
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,375
Baddie?

476
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:03,125
Let's go out and not stay in Dodo's room.

477
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,083
Okay?

478
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,416
We're going out now.

479
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,375
Come down!

480
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,166
Come down!

481
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,250
Come down!

482
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,291
Dodo, what are you doing?

483
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:28,916
CHIN CHIN KINDERGARTEN

484
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,041
Slow down.
Take care, don't fall. Careful.

485
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,666
Actually,
Dodo is very distracted in class.

486
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,708
-Ooh.
-She's not

487
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:46,416
really affecting the other students.

488
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,541
But she has this thing where she stares
at the ceiling and talks to herself.

489
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,666
Her classmate said,

490
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,166
that your daughter told them
that she saw a faceless baddie--

491
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,375
Principal, I'm sorry. You see…

492
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:59,000
Dodo told me something yesterday.
She said…

493
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:01,166
Kids, do you like the new toys we have?

494
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,250
-Yes.
-Right, listen.

495
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,583
Dodo's mom gave them to us.

496
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,000
We have to have manners.
So, what do we say to Dodo's mom?

497
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,041
Thank you!

498
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,375
Chen Dodo,

499
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:11,875
I promise that
I won't call you crazy anymore.

500
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:15,500
From now on,
I hope that we become good friends again

501
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,625
because your mom is very cool.

502
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,708
I hope that you stay
good friends with Dodo, okay?

503
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:21,625
Okay.

504
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,166
CHIN CHIN KINDERGARTEN

505
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,833
Come on. Come on.
Try and catch up with me.

506
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,000
Let's play hide and seek.

507
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,166
Ready?

508
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,291
Three, two, one. Run!

509
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,208
Dodo, where are you going to hide?
Where are you hiding?

510
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,916
Dodo?

511
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:29,333
Dodo.

512
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:30,500
What are you doing?

513
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,041
I'm playing with my toys.

514
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,333
Ooh.

515
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:38,291
Well, if you're playing with them,
then why are these dolls covered, huh?

516
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:43,583
Because they don't want to see the baddie.

517
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:49,791
Listen to Mommy, okay?

518
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,708
You know, I used to see baddies too.

519
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,708
-Really, you did?
-Mm-hm.

520
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:59,916
If you keep thinking about the monsters,

521
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,708
the monsters will surely go
and live inside your head.

522
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,291
Oh, no!

523
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:07,041
Doctor, what should I do then?
I'm so scared.

524
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:11,291
Okay then, let Dr. Bunny tell you how.

525
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,458
Listen, if you're feeling scared,

526
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,125
all you have to do is think about

527
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,583
your three favorite things
in the whole world.

528
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:21,083
Then, close your eyes
and then say them out loud.

529
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,833
And after that,
you won't be scared anymore.

530
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:26,833
I like three… pineapples.

531
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:29,500
Oh, is that so?
Pineapple is your favorite?

532
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:32,041
How about me, don't you like me anymore?

533
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,000
Don't you like me, Dodo?

534
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,916
I like you too, bunny.

535
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What about me?

536
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,041
Huh?

537
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,750
-Pineapple, bunny.
-Pineapple, bunny.

538
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:51,208
Just think about these from now on
whenever you're scared.

539
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:52,166
Okay?

540
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,416
Okay.

541
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,125
Okay, this is the last time.

542
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:58,166
Then straight to bed after. Hmm?

543
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:02,541
If you don't go to sleep…

544
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,833
…the monster will come and find you!

545
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:07,500
Ooh, the monster will tickle…

546
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:08,416
…you like this!

547
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:11,291
-Mommy.
-Hmm?

548
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,333
Did you throw me away,

549
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:17,541
because you were also
scared of monsters, like me?

550
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,416
Mommy's…

551
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,041
Mommy's not scared anymore.

552
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:31,791
Mm.

553
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:32,791
Go to sleep.

554
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,500
LI RONAN

555
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,791
What is your name?

556
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,916
Give it to me.

557
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,708
What is your name?

558
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,166
What is your name?

559
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:07,125
HOU-HO-XIU-YI, SI-SEI-WU-MA

560
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:08,375
Come.

561
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:10,208
Bow.

562
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,625
You must return

563
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:21,958
to worship Mother-Buddha every ten years.

564
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,333
After offering up your real name,

565
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:29,041
remember, you cannot use it here anymore.

566
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:32,083
You mustn't even think it in your mind.

567
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,250
Mother-Buddha is happy.

568
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,875
Once the little girl growing in your tummy

569
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:59,041
has a name, you must offer it
to Mother-Buddha too.

570
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,166
Understand?

571
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,125
What?

572
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,166
Come on, viewers,
take a look at this.

573
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,791
This dinner was prepared
by the great Chen clan.

574
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,500
Let's try some now.

575
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:18,625
Fuck.

576
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,458
Come and eat.

577
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:23,708
-Why aren't you eating?
-Huh?

578
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:24,666
Have some.

579
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,791
I'm not hungry.

580
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:29,291
I think it's pretty good, come and try it.
Hey, Ronan. Want to come and eat?

581
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,666
I'm already eating.

582
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,416
What's this?
You got to be kidding me.

583
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,208
Come on, we're ghostbusters.

584
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:37,500
Don't tell me you actually believe
that little girl?

585
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,083
Why, who said anyone's believing it?

586
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,208
She believes it!

587
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,875
-She's just feeling unwell.
-She does! Look, she's so nervous, okay?

588
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,291
-Hey, bro, listen to me.
-Can you…

589
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:45,958
-She's not possessed.
-…please cut it out?

590
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,541
She's pregnant.

591
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,875
Mind your own business.

592
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,291
I knew it.

593
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:55,916
Dear viewers.

594
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:57,791
Take a good look.

595
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,250
This here is a playboy.

596
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,208
This is the face of a playboy.

597
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,166
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

598
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,125
Are you sure?

599
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,125
I'm okay.

600
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,375
Fuck, stop being lovey-dovey.

601
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,666
Hurry up! What are you doing?
It's going to be over soon.

602
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:14,500
-Let's go.
-Oh.

603
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,625
-I'm sorry.
-Shh, shh. Go out, just go.

604
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,458
Slowly.

605
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:31,375
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.
-What are they worshipping?

606
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:36,833
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

607
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:39,208
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi…
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi…

608
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,541
-si-sei-wu-ma.
-How strange.

609
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,750
Over there, the little girl.
She's over there.

610
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,916
Good, film her.

611
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,375
This is so weird.

612
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,541
-Fuck.
-What?

613
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,708
I don't know, wait. Just wait.

614
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,583
She knows. Shit!

615
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,666
Did you three sneak out to play?

616
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:05,458
Yes.

617
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,000
Over there?

618
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:11,458
Do you want to go somewhere fun?

619
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:12,500
-Where?
-Sure.

620
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:15,083
Little girl, listen.
It looks super fun over there.

621
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:16,458
Isn't there a tunnel?

622
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:17,958
You can't go in there.

623
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,708
-Why?
-Where are we going?

624
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:22,041
Hey. Hey, hey, wait! Little girl.

625
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,791
You can't come in.

626
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,875
She can, but why can't I?

627
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,666
I'm sorry, but you just can't.

628
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:33,583
Oh, that's fine, it's okay.

629
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:40,833
What are you doing?

630
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:42,708
Getting this. I can film with this.

631
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,833
Wait, for me here.

632
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:47,916
Huh?

633
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:49,833
Wait…

634
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:51,375
Where are you going, little girl?

635
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,500
What is this?

636
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:03,916
Come here.

637
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:08,416
Look.

638
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,791
Wait, what is that?

639
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,208
Feed it.

640
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:13,250
What, but…

641
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,083
This… this is hair.

642
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,416
Feed it.

643
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,166
Okay, hold on.

644
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,291
I'm throwing it in now.

645
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:39,500
GHOST BUSTERS WERE HERE

646
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,708
Hurry up, please. Come on.

647
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,291
Here, over here.

648
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:51,583
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

649
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,083
Hou-ho-xiu…

650
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,541
What happened to your ear, huh?

651
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:06,333
Mother-Buddha took it.

652
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,458
What does that mean?

653
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:11,875
You see, I was chosen by the gods,

654
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:15,791
so Mother-Buddha took my flesh
in order to bless everyone.

655
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,875
Hou-ho-xiu-yi,
si-sei-wu-ma.

656
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,708
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

657
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:39,916
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

658
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,666
What are you doing?

659
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,833
Don't you know that
you can't come in here?

660
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:48,500
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

661
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,500
Whoo!

662
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,750
Awesome!

663
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:54,916
Today is Dodo's birthday.

664
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,666
Wow, why do you keep getting shorter, huh?

665
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,250
Wow! Amazing!

666
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,333
-Mom, come here.
-Hmm?

667
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:24,625
Look at him.

668
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,375
You like him?

669
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:27,625
It's Woofy.

670
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,333
That's Woofy? Is he Woofy?

671
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:32,916
Woofy.

672
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:35,041
Woofy?

673
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,500
Look at Woofy.

674
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:43,291
Please tell me, Mommy,
when can we bring Woofy home?

675
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:44,333
Well…

676
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,166
We'll bring him home
when you're all grown up

677
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,541
and can look after him.
Otherwise, no one will take care of him.

678
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,083
Okay?

679
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,333
Come on, have some, okay?

680
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:57,375
Hmm? Aah.

681
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:58,708
Aah…

682
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,708
Is it delicious?

683
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,291
It's okay.

684
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,500
Hey little girl, what are you filming?

685
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:14,166
It's a birthday video.

686
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,083
-Thank you.
-Why don't we…

687
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,750
I have some questions about the house.

688
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,583
Okay, sure. Dodo, wait for me here.

689
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:23,291
I'll go inside and I'll be right back.
Okay? Hmm?

690
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:26,625
Well, the Buddha statues
on the top floor…

691
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,625
Do you still want them?

692
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,958
I think they're kind of scary.

693
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:34,083
Uh…
I'll get someone to take care of that.

694
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:38,166
Okay. I think some buyers would, you know…
Some would care about these things, yes.

695
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,458
Hmm?

696
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,375
Where should I go?

697
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,041
Huh? What is it?

698
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:30,583
Yes.

699
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,208
Is it down there?

700
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:15,125
And then what?

701
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,958
Okay.

702
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:08,291
Now, what do I do?

703
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:21,916
Where do I go?

704
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,875
Yes?

705
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:15,541
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

706
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:32,333
Dodo!

707
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:35,583
Chen Le-tung, what are you doing?

708
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:44,500
Didn't I tell you
to stay right there, Dodo?

709
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:47,208
I told you to wait.
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?

710
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:50,458
Do… Dodo!

711
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:52,416
Dodo, what's the matter? Dodo!

712
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:59,125
She was fine
when I saw her a few days ago.

713
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,416
What the doctor means is…

714
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:07,333
that Dodo's hemiparesis
might be brain-induced?

715
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,916
Oh, by the way…

716
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,708
Here. Take it.

717
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,291
You see, a few days ago,

718
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:25,958
Ms. Hsia got this for Dodo,
it's from the temple.

719
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:29,041
Dodo's name is inside it.

720
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:34,500
-And hopefully, it will keep her safe.
-I don't want it.

721
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,166
Why…

722
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:38,291
Why did you give me that?

723
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,333
I… I didn't say I wanted it.

724
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:42,791
Now, the teacher
is using a different tool,

725
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:45,416
so we can make changes
and adjustments to the shape.

726
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,541
And right now, as you can see him doing,

727
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:50,416
the teacher is using the digging
and kneading method.

728
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,000
Look at his technique carefully.
In order for him to change the shape,

729
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,916
the raw material must be very soft.

730
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,166
That means the temperature
must be very high.

731
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,250
So, what would happen
if the temperature drops?

732
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,875
Obviously, the work will be hard,

733
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:04,833
and there's no way
to shape the raw material.

734
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:08,375
In the process of creation,
you must also pay close attention to…

735
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,166
What? But we're already here.

736
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,125
It doesn't matter.
Go home tomorrow morning.

737
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,708
Granduncle, but it's so far from here.

738
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:19,916
Granduncle!

739
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,541
Shit, they locked the door.

740
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,666
-Fuck, seriously?
-I think they locked us in.

741
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:25,750
Hey!

742
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,625
-Let us out!
-Why did you lock the door?

743
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:28,875
Hey!

744
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,791
Do you have any tools?

745
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,833
-Oh, shit.
-Maybe there's something here we can use?

746
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:38,250
Got it?

747
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:40,875
I think so.

748
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,333
Try it.

749
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:47,541
It's open! Okay, come on, let's go.

750
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,916
-Hey, wait.
-I can't believe they locked us in.

751
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,875
-Shit.
-Hey, Yuan.

752
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:53,125
What?

753
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:54,083
Look at her.

754
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:55,750
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

755
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,083
-I'm okay.
-See, she's okay.

756
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:00,541
Are you sure?

757
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,541
I'm not sure where the little girl went.
Let's take a look.

758
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,625
Yes, let's check on her. Hurry, come on.

759
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:10,375
Okay. Dear viewers.

760
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:13,250
The Ghost Busters are heading
to the forbidden place.

761
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:16,791
The infamous place you must not go to.

762
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:20,666
Film the barrier talisman.
Film it quickly.

763
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,875
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

764
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:24,916
Wow! Look at this barrier talisman.

765
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,666
It's terrifying.

766
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:27,916
Let's go.

767
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,583
Hey. What's wrong now?

768
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:37,041
Oh.

769
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,375
Dear viewers.

770
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:41,291
Up next,

771
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:44,708
the moment you've been waiting for.
We'll be heading into

772
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:46,833
the Chen clan's
"tunnel you must not enter."

773
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:49,083
Hey.

774
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,125
Are you really pregnant?

775
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:54,791
What's the matter? Are you scared?

776
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:57,500
No, I'm not scared.

777
00:47:58,541 --> 00:47:59,750
What else could it be?

778
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:03,875
Let's name her Chen Le-tung.

779
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:05,708
-What?
-Fuck!

780
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:07,583
You're being lovey-dovey again.

781
00:48:07,666 --> 00:48:09,541
-No, we're not.
-Then what are you doing?

782
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:10,833
She's not feeling well.

783
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:12,791
-You idiots, hurry up!
-Okay!

784
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,291
-Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
-What? What's wrong?

785
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,666
-What is it?
-Turn off the flashlight. Hurry!

786
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,000
-What?
-Turn it off first. Hurry.

787
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:19,625
Come on. Hurry this way. Follow me.

788
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:21,375
Turn off the flashlight.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

789
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:23,000
I'm turning it off. It's off.

790
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:35,125
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

791
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:39,625
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

792
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:43,875
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

793
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:48,541
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

794
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:52,416
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

795
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,833
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

796
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:59,541
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei--
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei--

797
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:12,750
I watched it.

798
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:16,875
What exactly are you afraid of?

799
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:20,041
Are you afraid of not being forgiven?

800
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,375
Or are you afraid that
even you can't forgive yourself?

801
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,583
One, two, three, go.

802
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,791
It's okay.

803
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,416
Are you afraid of this curse,
or that you're going crazy again?

804
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:41,333
Don't think.
Don't think about anything, then I'll win.

805
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:42,625
Yes, I just need to do it.

806
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:43,833
Don't think.

807
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:45,500
Don't think. Don't think.

808
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:51,791
Some people see a fallen chair
and say it's a ghost.

809
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:55,250
What the hell?

810
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:58,458
You told me you're not afraid
of monsters anymore.

811
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:00,041
You said so yourself!

812
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:03,500
But others would see
a fallen chair and say that it's…

813
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,625
a miracle from God.

814
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:07,625
Dodo.

815
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:09,458
Don't be scared, okay?

816
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,875
The world is
as you choose to see it.

817
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:16,666
I can't give you an answer.

818
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:20,958
Oh, gosh. This head looks so tasty.

819
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,416
How you view the world

820
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,083
can truly bring about tiny changes to it.

821
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:30,375
This is very important.
I have a document here for you to sign.

822
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:34,041
It mainly says that the court
has revoked your custody rights.

823
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:36,333
Go ahead. Just sign here.

824
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:40,000
-We need your cooperation here.
-No, I cannot sign it.

825
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,166
Please consider this carefully,
this is a notice from the court.

826
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:48,541
You have no choice on the matter.

827
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:50,291
You are just being notified.

828
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:52,625
I do not know

829
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:55,000
if ghosts or gods

830
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:56,416
really do exist.

831
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,583
But what I am certain of

832
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,000
is that you decide

833
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,500
how your world is shaped.

834
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:18,250
Dodo. Listen,
I'm going up to get something.

835
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,458
I'll be back real quick.

836
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:22,375
Where are we going, Mommy?

837
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:26,291
-Do you trust your Mommy?
-Mm.

838
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,375
Good.

839
00:51:57,541 --> 00:51:58,708
Dodo?

840
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:03,666
Hi, Dodo.

841
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,208
Open this window for daddy.

842
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,083
Dodo.

843
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:18,541
Where's your mom?

844
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,125
My mom went upstairs.

845
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:23,625
Your mom is upstairs?

846
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:25,583
Did your mom…

847
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:27,583
Did your mom say where you're going?

848
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:39,000
Dodo.

849
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:42,250
Do you want to go back to my place?

850
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:44,166
Yes, dad.

851
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,000
Yes? Okay, then let's go back home.

852
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:56,375
What's the matter?

853
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,833
If we go, then what about Mom?

854
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:13,208
Open the door. Hurry, please.

855
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:15,833
Open up! Come on!

856
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:17,375
Please!

857
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,125
Open the door.

858
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:20,333
Open the door!

859
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:21,708
Get in. Get in!

860
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:24,833
She's over there.

861
00:53:24,916 --> 00:53:26,791
That's her. That's her!

862
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,041
Stay there!

863
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:30,583
-Wait, miss!
-Stop the car.

864
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,041
-Pull over! Hurry to the front.
-Please stop!

865
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:35,666
-Miss, please!
-Stop the car!

866
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:36,666
Stop!

867
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,750
Stop the car! Hey!

868
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:40,958
Hey! Wait!

869
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,291
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Over here.

870
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:47,166
What, what is it?

871
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,500
-Fuck, it's that little girl.
-What's going on?

872
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:51,291
-Little girl?
-Let's take her down first.

873
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:55,958
Little girl.

874
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:58,208
-Little girl, wake up.
-Dear viewers.

875
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:00,791
This must be the Chen family's

876
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,166
"tunnel that you must not enter."

877
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:04,958
HOU-HO-XIU-YI

878
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,333
Yes, this must be it.

879
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:09,291
How is she?

880
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:10,541
A pig's head.

881
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:12,791
There's a goat.

882
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:15,000
Little girl,
can you hear my voice?

883
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,791
Okay, this is it. Let's go in.

884
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:18,375
-Yuan. Let's forget it.
-What?

885
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:20,166
-Huh?
-I have a bad feeling about this.

886
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,500
-How many times are you going to do this?
-Should we…

887
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:24,125
-take her down to see a doctor first.
-Shit! Are you insane?

888
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,583
Fuck, motherfucker!

889
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:27,125
-Hey.
-You do this every time.

890
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,541
-Ronan's not feeling well. Cut it out.
-Fuck!

891
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:30,250
-Are you stupid? Fucking asshole.
-Yuan.

892
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:31,500
Chen Chen-yuan!

893
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:32,750
Chen Chen-yuan!

894
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:50,875
Did you hear something?

895
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,791
What's that sound?

896
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:00,791
Is that a child crying?

897
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:09,583
Yuan.

898
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:12,666
Are you sure you want to go in?

899
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:13,833
But wait…

900
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:19,833
…what if there are
other children in there?

901
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,208
-Let's go.
-Hey.

902
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:26,416
What?

903
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:32,958
Stay here and look after her.

904
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,875
-I'm going in with Yuan.
-But, what if…

905
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:36,625
Let's go.

906
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:43,333
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

907
00:55:43,416 --> 00:55:47,458
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

908
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:51,583
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

909
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:53,416
THE PLACE YOU MUST NOT ENTER

910
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,916
What's the matter?

911
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,125
Are you okay?

912
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:01,583
Hey!

913
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:10,750
What's going on?

914
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:12,416
Dom!

915
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:22,583
Where are you going? Yuan!

916
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:23,833
Yuan!

917
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:25,333
Where are you going?

918
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,458
Chen Chen-yuan!

919
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:30,833
Dom.

920
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:33,666
What should I do?

921
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,458
Huh?

922
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,333
Don't ask.

923
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,625
Don't ask!

924
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:18,416
Yuan.

925
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:28,291
Yuan.

926
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:33,000
Yuan.

927
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:46,166
Don't ask!

928
00:59:06,416 --> 00:59:07,583
Yuan.

929
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,125
Yuan.

930
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:45,791
Don't ask!

931
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:49,166
Don't ask.

932
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:05,000
So, itchy. My teeth.

933
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,041
-My teeth.
-Yuan…

934
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:09,333
My teeth!

935
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:10,541
Yuan!

936
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:39,541
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

937
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,500
Don't ask!

938
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:50,375
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

939
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:04,583
How much further is the temple?

940
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:08,166
It should be close.
I haven't been there for a long time.

941
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,916
What is that?

942
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,458
Did you see it?

943
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,833
Is that a person?

944
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:16,791
How is this possible?

945
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:56,000
Hey.

946
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:57,208
What's going on?

947
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:59,250
How could this happen?

948
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,291
Something's wrong.

949
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:12,041
What is it?

950
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,583
What are you doing?

951
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:28,791
It's nothing.

952
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:38,250
A shocking gas explosion
happened at a psychiatric treatment clinic

953
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:39,666
in Yuexiang Road Section 3.

954
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:40,833
In the toilet…

955
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:44,333
…hanging corpse.

956
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:46,958
The victim is the person-in-charge,
Dr. Wu Yu-ching.

957
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:49,416
The cause of the fire remains unclear…

958
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:52,500
Come on, start!

959
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,958
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

960
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:07,666
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

961
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,375
Mommy, I'm scared.

962
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:13,875
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

963
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:17,833
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.
-Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

964
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:20,916
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

965
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,916
It's okay. It's okay.

966
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,875
VANQUISH DEMONS, CATCH GHOSTS,
ELIMINATE EVIL SPIRITS

967
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,750
What should come will come.

968
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:43,333
Such as fate.

969
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:06,375
What exactly is in the camera?

970
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:26,000
You have to remember
and this is important.

971
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:28,708
Don't let the child eat anything
for seven days straight.

972
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:31,583
Seven days!
But how can a child not eat for so long?

973
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:34,333
The master and I are putting
our lives on the line here.

974
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:36,708
If you can't do that,

975
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:39,333
let's just end this right now
and stop this.

976
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:44,833
We have to set up the altar.

977
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:46,958
Remember you must not let her eat.

978
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:48,916
Come back in seven days.

979
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,500
Could you please tell me,

980
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:03,916
how does it feel
to raise a child into adulthood?

981
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:08,041
As you know, it's a foster home. So…

982
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:10,500
children, they tend to come and go.

983
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:15,416
I've never really raised a child
into an adult, so…

984
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,541
I want to know the answer to that too.

985
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:19,916
What it feels like
to raise a child into adulthood.

986
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:23,916
Dodo.

987
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:26,916
Tell me, you like your Mommy, huh?

988
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Mm.

989
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,708
But don't you think
that she's very strange?

990
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:39,666
Yes, but she's still my Mommy.

991
01:06:52,666 --> 01:06:55,166
Ming,
don't you have your own children?

992
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:58,458
Let's skip this question.

993
01:06:58,541 --> 01:06:59,541
Okay.

994
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:00,708
Let's talk about Dodo.

995
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:18,750
I TOOK THE VIDEO CAMERA,
I'LL FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

996
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:24,541
I WANT TO KNOW
HOW IT FEELS LIKE TO BE A REAL DAD

997
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,416
Dodo.

998
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,083
Have you flown a kite before?

999
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:34,208
Not yet.

1000
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,208
Sir.

1001
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:42,125
How much is this kite at the front?

1002
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:45,500
Oh, that's not for sale.
A customer ordered it.

1003
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:47,291
The bubble blower is better, yeah.

1004
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:50,333
She can blow on it while sitting down.
She's in a wheelchair anyway.

1005
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:55,333
-Hmm, no, that's okay.
-The bubble blower is nice.

1006
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:56,958
-No, it's fine.
-Okay.

1007
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:07,916
Mommy,
it's bad to steal things, right?

1008
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:11,416
We'll return it later
so we won't be bad. Hmm?

1009
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:25,291
I hope she's happy
when she remembers our time together.

1010
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:38,708
Dodo?

1011
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:39,708
Huh?

1012
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:41,208
Why are you all sweaty?

1013
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:43,666
Do you feel really hot?

1014
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:45,166
Let's go.

1015
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,500
-Bunny.
-Come on, bunny.

1016
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:49,583
We're almost at the hospital. Okay?

1017
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:51,666
Hold on a little longer.

1018
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,041
Hello, is anybody there?

1019
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:54,208
LAI HSIEN-CHUNG'S CLINIC

1020
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,375
Is there anybody there?

1021
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:58,791
Come on…

1022
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:03,291
Hang on. Hang on, hang on!

1023
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:05,541
Please take a look at her.
It won't take long, it will be very quick.

1024
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:10,250
Oh, dear! She needs an injection.

1025
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:12,750
The antipyretic will have side effects
on an empty stomach.

1026
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:13,833
Feed her then come back.

1027
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,458
But doctor… must she really eat?

1028
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:19,833
She can't be injected with it otherwise.
Don't you get it?

1029
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:21,500
-Hurry up! Hurry!
-Okay.

1030
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:23,416
I'll wait for you. Move.

1031
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:25,625
Okay, okay.

1032
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:38,416
HOW TO ADMINISTER A DRIP?

1033
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,458
HOW TO ADMINISTER A DRIP AT HOME?
INTRAVENOUS METHOD

1034
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:03,166
Today marks the third day.

1035
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:06,000
Her legs have become wrinkly.

1036
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,333
I think they're atrophying.

1037
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:13,000
I wonder if I hadn't brought her home,

1038
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:17,625
would she still turn out this way?

1039
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:30,041
I'm so hungry.

1040
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:32,875
Let's get rid of this, okay?

1041
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:35,000
-Mm.
-I'll take it out.

1042
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,291
On my birthday…

1043
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:47,083
We had such a big cake.

1044
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:52,750
Is this for Mommy?

1045
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:54,666
Mm.

1046
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:59,041
Then I'll eat it.

1047
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:04,625
Don't cry.

1048
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:13,416
All you need to do is
think of your three favorite things

1049
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:16,625
and you won't be scared anymore.

1050
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:20,625
Mm.

1051
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:46,541
Keep the change.

1052
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:54,625
Here.

1053
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:57,958
Ah.

1054
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:00,208
Ah.

1055
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:04,541
Mmm.

1056
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,375
It's so sweet.

1057
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:14,458
What do I do?

1058
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:20,291
THE VIDEO CLIP OF THE TUNNEL

1059
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:24,916
This video camera isn't broken,
the file was just destroyed.

1060
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:28,916
Then I found a repairing software
on an international website.

1061
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:34,541
But the repair progress
of the tunnel clip keeps failing.

1062
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:41,250
This is strange
but the more of this video I watch…

1063
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:43,916
…the more unwell I feel.

1064
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:55,750
Could this be a curse?

1065
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,166
So…

1066
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,708
Okay, the hand gesture they do

1067
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:05,958
is like a modified version
of Bafangtian in Tantric Buddhism.

1068
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:08,708
The difference is

1069
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:13,291
if Bafangtian gesture means
to "collect blessing."

1070
01:13:15,041 --> 01:13:18,333
This one's ending gesture
is completely in the opposite direction.

1071
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:21,041
So, what does it mean?

1072
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:24,041
To spread…

1073
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:25,583
Spread it?

1074
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,333
In this image
captured on the video,

1075
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:41,875
there are similar temples all around it.

1076
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:45,208
There's a goat on top of that temple.

1077
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:49,375
So, I asked
a few of my theologian friends.

1078
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,833
And they told me.

1079
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:55,166
This kind of twisted text
looks like a Brahmic script

1080
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:58,125
used to record Buddhist scriptures
in ancient India.

1081
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,041
Then I researched online later on.

1082
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:02,916
SHI KONG-YUN

1083
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,833
There's a Tantric Buddhist monk in Yunnan
who lives in seclusion.

1084
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:08,833
He's one of the last remaining people

1085
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:10,958
who can translate
ancient Buddhist scriptures.

1086
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:13,125
So…

1087
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,833
I'm thinking that if I can go there

1088
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:19,166
and find him,

1089
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,416
maybe I'll get an answer.

1090
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:25,958
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're arriving at

1091
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:28,208
Xishuangbanna Gasa International Airport.

1092
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:46,500
This should be the place.

1093
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,625
I think he's telling me
to wait right here.

1094
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,791
Listen carefully,

1095
01:14:57,875 --> 01:15:00,458
I've forwarded you the video
of the Yunnan monk.

1096
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:04,041
It explains the origins of the disciples
and the meaning

1097
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:07,041
of… of the incantation.

1098
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:10,583
The…

1099
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:17,125
The video clip of the tunnel
has finally been repaired.

1100
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:19,291
But I won't send it to you anymore.

1101
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:24,125
I'm sorry.

1102
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:29,458
I was the one who reported your inadequacy
to the Social Affairs Bureau.

1103
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:32,583
Because I didn't trust you.

1104
01:15:35,541 --> 01:15:37,208
I also thought it was unfair to me.

1105
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:41,541
I'm sorry.

1106
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,666
If something untoward happens to me,

1107
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:50,791
I hope you can let Dodo know that,

1108
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,750
that even though I can never have…

1109
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:58,500
my very own children biologically…

1110
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,666
I'm very happy that…

1111
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:10,541
Dodo was willing to call me Dad.

1112
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:27,375
Hsieh Chi-ming.

1113
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:30,958
Hsieh Chi-ming.

1114
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:35,375
Hsieh…

1115
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:39,125
Hsieh Chi-ming.

1116
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:42,125
Hsieh Chi-ming.

1117
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,625
Hsieh Chi-ming.

1118
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:01,708
FROM MING ATTACHMENT:
INSIDE THE TUNNEL

1119
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:05,875
Ouch, it hurts…

1120
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:08,583
What hurts?

1121
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,416
My hand…

1122
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,666
Your hand?

1123
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:13,750
Let me see.

1124
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,375
Come on.

1125
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:04,875
Spit out the pineapple, okay?

1126
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,541
Okay, here we go.

1127
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:15,458
Okay, very good.

1128
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:17,791
One more time. One more time, okay?

1129
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,666
One more time, come on.

1130
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:22,583
One, two, three.

1131
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:41,291
Master Ching!

1132
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,875
Master Ching.

1133
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,583
Madam Ching!

1134
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,666
Master Ching…

1135
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,958
Did you let the child eat?

1136
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,083
Madam Ching.

1137
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:13,875
Listen, child.

1138
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:15,875
Let me tell you.

1139
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:21,083
When your mother was pregnant with you,

1140
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:23,958
she was going to offer you to the gods.

1141
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:09,541
Dodo.

1142
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:10,750
Dodo!

1143
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:14,375
Dodo.

1144
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,041
Dodo…

1145
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:18,791
Dodo!

1146
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:28,583
Do you…

1147
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,791
Do you believe in such things
as blessings?

1148
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:41,916
My name is Li Ronan.

1149
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:47,416
Six years ago,
I violated a terrifying taboo.

1150
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,083
HOU-HO-XIU-YI, SI-SEI-WU-MA

1151
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:51,166
Help me.

1152
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:54,250
Please recite this with me.

1153
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:57,583
Doing it in your mind is fine too.

1154
01:21:57,666 --> 01:21:58,916
HOU-HO-XIU-YI, SI-SEI-WU-MA

1155
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,500
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

1156
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:08,625
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

1157
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:13,583
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

1158
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:18,375
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

1159
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:28,083
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma is--

1160
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:33,416
The Yunnan monk says that,

1161
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:37,166
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma

1162
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:40,750
is actually an ancient religious blessing.

1163
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:45,750
This religion spread
from Southeast Asia to Yunnan,

1164
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:47,875
and to where Dom's family is.

1165
01:22:49,958 --> 01:22:53,958
The deity worshiped by their ancestors
is called Dahei Mother-Buddha.

1166
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:55,458
It's a malicious deity.

1167
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:57,458
So…

1168
01:22:58,375 --> 01:23:02,000
they've inherited bad karma
from generation to generation.

1169
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:05,125
They must use this incantation
in order to receive blessings.

1170
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,625
Therefore, if a lot of people chanted,

1171
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:13,416
the power of blessing will be gathered

1172
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,875
and it will protect
the person who chants it.

1173
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:32,000
The child's breathing and pulse
have stabilized for now.

1174
01:23:32,083 --> 01:23:34,166
That's good news regarding her condition.

1175
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:38,166
But we noticed that
she has severe dehydration

1176
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,916
and she suffers from malnutrition.

1177
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,958
Bacterial infection has already spread
across her entire body.

1178
01:23:45,666 --> 01:23:49,500
I am arranging for her
to be monitored further in the ICU.

1179
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:51,583
-Thank you, doctor.
-But Ms. Li,

1180
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:53,375
things are far from being good.

1181
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:55,708
You need to be prepared for the worst.

1182
01:24:24,166 --> 01:24:26,000
INSIDE THE TUNNEL.MOV

1183
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,375
PLAY

1184
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:12,458
A naked girl around junior high age

1185
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:15,500
was discovered lying naked
in an empty lot beside a hospital

1186
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:18,125
shown to be wearing
only her undergarments.

1187
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,625
What's strange is that runes
were written all over her body.

1188
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:25,583
Dodo, Mommy's here.
Open your eyes and look at me, okay?

1189
01:25:26,083 --> 01:25:28,375
Dodo?

1190
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,625
Right now, she's still unconscious.

1191
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:32,708
So, now… now what? What do we do?

1192
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:34,875
What now?

1193
01:25:35,416 --> 01:25:36,666
Please, calm down.

1194
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:38,041
She's not in a good condition,

1195
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:40,541
but we will continue monitoring her.

1196
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:43,958
By the way, didn't she mention
something earlier?

1197
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,666
Something like pineapple bun…

1198
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:47,833
Pineapple bunny.

1199
01:25:47,916 --> 01:25:48,958
It's probably a doll.

1200
01:26:14,833 --> 01:26:16,041
-Mommy.
-Hmm?

1201
01:26:16,125 --> 01:26:18,208
Did you throw me away

1202
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:21,916
because you were also
scared of monsters, like me?

1203
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:25,750
Mommy's…

1204
01:26:26,708 --> 01:26:28,416
Mommy's not scared anymore.

1205
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:26,458
I'm about to show you

1206
01:27:28,291 --> 01:27:31,958
the video when we violated
the taboo six years ago.

1207
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:44,958
This way.

1208
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:51,958
-Hey, Yuan. Yuan!
-Hmm?

1209
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:56,208
Look at this.

1210
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:00,458
Hey, don't touch it.

1211
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:01,750
I'll just take a look.

1212
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:07,916
MISFORTUNE AND BLESSING
DEPEND ON EACH OTHER

1213
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,291
The sound is coming from there.

1214
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:27,291
Hey, there's a mirror over there.

1215
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:50,208
Hey, watch your step.

1216
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:53,333
There are so many mirrors here too.

1217
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:05,666
Let's keep going.

1218
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:12,333
Is that a door?

1219
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:14,666
I don't know.

1220
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:25,125
What?

1221
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:26,375
I'm looking.

1222
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:34,416
Did you hear that?

1223
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,083
Let's move it aside.

1224
01:29:44,166 --> 01:29:45,458
SI-SEI-WU-MA

1225
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:46,375
Careful.

1226
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:55,833
There's another mirror behind it.

1227
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:04,208
Let's go.

1228
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:07,625
Are we going in?

1229
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:10,875
Look at this.

1230
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:15,000
I filmed the same thing earlier.

1231
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:33,583
Hair.

1232
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,375
Hey.

1233
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:39,166
Don't touch it.

1234
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:52,458
There's another one.

1235
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:58,625
Hey, come over here.

1236
01:30:58,708 --> 01:30:59,708
What the hell is this?

1237
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:01,500
-Teeth.
-Huh?

1238
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:04,916
Hey, listen.

1239
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:07,458
You hear that?

1240
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:11,625
That sound.

1241
01:31:14,291 --> 01:31:15,541
Take a look over there.

1242
01:31:17,083 --> 01:31:18,208
There.

1243
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:22,125
Hey.

1244
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:24,166
Forget about it. Let's go back.

1245
01:31:25,166 --> 01:31:26,000
It's okay.

1246
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:43,583
Is anything there?

1247
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,541
If not, let's go.

1248
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:55,333
What are you doing?

1249
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,666
-The sound.
-What are you doing?

1250
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:05,958
I'll uncover it. Hold this for me.
Hurry up.

1251
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Dom.

1252
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:21,833
What is it, Dom?

1253
01:32:23,958 --> 01:32:25,125
What's my name?

1254
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:26,791
Dom.

1255
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:27,791
Chen Li-tung!

1256
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,166
Hey!

1257
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:30,625
What are you doing?

1258
01:32:30,708 --> 01:32:32,416
What are you doing? Hey!

1259
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,125
Chen Li-tung, that's enough!

1260
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:36,291
What are you doing?
Don't scare me like this.

1261
01:32:36,375 --> 01:32:37,833
Don't scare me! What are you doing?

1262
01:32:37,916 --> 01:32:40,458
Hurry! Let's get out of here!

1263
01:32:40,541 --> 01:32:42,916
Don't scare me! Hurry, let's go!

1264
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:48,250
Dom! Get up, hurry!

1265
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:51,166
Let's go!

1266
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:52,750
Dom, let's go!

1267
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:55,083
Dom, come on. Let's go!

1268
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:56,375
Let's go!

1269
01:32:56,875 --> 01:32:59,750
Dom. Dom!

1270
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:01,333
Dom. Dom!

1271
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:04,125
Dom!

1272
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:09,125
No!

1273
01:33:37,041 --> 01:33:37,916
Dom?

1274
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:40,541
Dom.

1275
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:42,750
Where are you, Dom?

1276
01:33:58,083 --> 01:33:58,958
Dom?

1277
01:34:12,666 --> 01:34:13,541
Dom?

1278
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:17,875
Huh?

1279
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:37,708
Dom, what are you doing?

1280
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:41,541
Dom?

1281
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:44,916
Dom, what are you doing?

1282
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Dom!

1283
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:50,333
Dom.

1284
01:34:50,916 --> 01:34:52,000
Dom!

1285
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:09,125
Help!

1286
01:35:26,291 --> 01:35:27,458
They say that

1287
01:35:28,375 --> 01:35:30,541
the moment you set your eyes on your child

1288
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,416
you will instantly feel like a mother.

1289
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,416
But I didn't.

1290
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,375
I was just so scared.

1291
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:43,000
I'm still scared now.

1292
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,125
I don't know if I'm very selfish.

1293
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:50,250
CHEN LE-TUNG

1294
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:52,625
I don't know if I only want
to be good to you

1295
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:54,166
because of the guilt I'm feeling.

1296
01:35:57,625 --> 01:36:00,666
I don't even know how it was
that I fell in love with you.

1297
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:07,583
Did I fall in love with you
while watching you sleep?

1298
01:36:10,375 --> 01:36:12,416
Or was it when you were crying?

1299
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:16,375
Is that love?

1300
01:36:19,333 --> 01:36:21,333
You didn't have a choice, right?

1301
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:26,416
You could have been in a better place.

1302
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:30,208
You could've been fine.

1303
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:35,791
Forgive me.

1304
01:36:37,916 --> 01:36:39,000
Dodo.

1305
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:45,375
I'm sorry.

1306
01:36:46,791 --> 01:36:49,083
Mommy won't hurt you anymore.

1307
01:36:56,791 --> 01:36:58,708
Listen, if you wake up,

1308
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:01,791
can you promise me…

1309
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:10,875
to forget your name?

1310
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:20,541
And forget me.

1311
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:25,041
From now on,

1312
01:37:25,916 --> 01:37:27,583
if you're happy,

1313
01:37:27,666 --> 01:37:29,125
then laugh out loud.

1314
01:37:30,583 --> 01:37:34,041
And when you walk,
walk properly with big, big strides.

1315
01:37:35,083 --> 01:37:40,125
And if ever you see food that you like,
take big, big mouthfuls and grow plump.

1316
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:50,666
Promise Mom.

1317
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:54,583
When you open your eyes every day,

1318
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,208
you have to be happier than others.

1319
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:33,000
GHOST BUSTERS WERE HERE

1320
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:52,625
Do you still remember the incantation?

1321
01:40:54,291 --> 01:40:55,583
And if you can, please,

1322
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:58,833
recite it with me in your mind again.

1323
01:41:00,875 --> 01:41:04,583
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

1324
01:41:12,291 --> 01:41:13,416
Look.

1325
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,083
This is the full translation
from the Yunnan monk.

1326
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:22,416
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

1327
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:34,416
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

1328
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:46,416
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

1329
01:41:54,625 --> 01:41:58,583
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

1330
01:42:06,583 --> 01:42:10,458
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

1331
01:42:18,708 --> 01:42:22,875
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma.

1332
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:28,625
Forgive me.

1333
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:30,583
I lied to you.

1334
01:42:31,291 --> 01:42:33,250
If you're not willing to keep watching,

1335
01:42:33,875 --> 01:42:37,916
then do this. Please think
of your three favorite things.

1336
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,208
From now on,

1337
01:42:40,291 --> 01:42:41,541
please close your eyes.

1338
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:45,416
Actually, "Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma",

1339
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,000
the incantation,

1340
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:50,375
is not a blessing.

1341
01:42:50,916 --> 01:42:53,166
It's a Minnan dialect saying that
"misfortune and blessing

1342
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:55,666
depend on one another,
death and life lies in the name."

1343
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:59,166
Reciting it means,

1344
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:04,000
"I wish to share in this curse
and offer up my name."

1345
01:43:04,083 --> 01:43:05,958
As for the symbol,

1346
01:43:06,041 --> 01:43:09,041
it's a spell for diffusing
Mother-Buddha's curse onto strangers.

1347
01:43:09,125 --> 01:43:14,416
The more people bearing the curse,
the more diluted it becomes.

1348
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:18,208
The deeper you look,
the heavier the burden.

1349
01:43:18,291 --> 01:43:23,125
The Mother-Buddha's face
is the heart of the curse.

1350
01:43:23,208 --> 01:43:29,041
That's why they cover it up
and never look at it.

1351
01:43:32,041 --> 01:43:33,250
Ms. Li,

1352
01:43:33,333 --> 01:43:37,500
what the master means is that.
Hou-ho-xiu-yi, si-sei-wu-ma--

1353
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,041
I'm sorry.

1354
01:43:56,083 --> 01:43:59,125
I'm aware that some things
should not be seen.

1355
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:07,416
But this is really the only way
I can save my daughter.

1356
01:44:10,833 --> 01:44:14,666
If I can manipulate more people
to see this video and this symbol,

1357
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:19,458
then perhaps her curse will be lessened.

1358
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:52,208
If possible,

1359
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:57,416
I really wish that you weren't my child.

1360
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:03,958
Because I'm not a good mother.

1361
01:45:07,333 --> 01:45:08,333
Because…

1362
01:45:10,708 --> 01:45:12,166
I really…

1363
01:45:12,916 --> 01:45:16,291
really wish you can open
your eyes every day.

1364
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,875
And be very happy.

1365
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:54,875
What is your name?

1366
01:46:25,833 --> 01:46:28,750
Our beautiful home is so far away.

1367
01:46:30,541 --> 01:46:33,791
But it's okay. We can catch a bus.

1368
01:46:34,375 --> 01:46:37,875
But there are no buses heading
to our castle.

1369
01:46:38,416 --> 01:46:41,916
Our castle was blown away by bubbles.

1370
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,833
Pretty bubbles!
