There must be one more activity,

He must be very important to you.

1032
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:23,250
He was.

1033
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:25,958
He certainly was.

1034
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:28,000
Where is he now?

1035
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:34,250
Somewhere around here.

1036
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:37,166
Why don't you go find him?

1037
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:42,041
I don't think he would recognize me.

1038

He would if you're important to him.

Can I ask you something?

1043
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:16,083
Do you believe in reincarnation?

1044
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:20,208
I'm not sure.

1045
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:22,916
I just think that

1046
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:24,750
our other self might be

1047
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:26,833

Something like that.

Why do you ask?

1051
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:36,250
You are a science teacher.

1052
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:38,125
I believe that...

1053
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:41,625
the reason that we've met

1054

and known each other

1055
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:45,375
is for something special

1056
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:47,500
or...

1057
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:50,625
we're destined.
