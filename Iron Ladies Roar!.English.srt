1
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:38,916
This national team is good.

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,875
Yes.

3
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:43,041
But our Iron Ladies is better.

4
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,458
Foul mouth! That's the national team
you're talking about.

5
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,291
You're a pain in the ass!

6
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,916
Mui, your feet!

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,916
What feet?

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,041
Crow's feet!

9
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,625
Shut up, you nutter.

10
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,666
Gotta brush it off.

11
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,750
Very good.

12
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,958
Is there any left?

13
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,291
It's still visible.

14
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,375
Okay, I'll take it.

15
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,750
Are you doing it yourself, Noina?

16
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,291
I didn't go to the medical school
but I can do it. Easy.

17
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,291
Don't worry.

18
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,083
-Really?
-Yes.

19
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:54,500
-What?
-Oh my...

20
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,750
-Noina!
-Noina!

21
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,666
-Shit!
-I didn't mean to.

22
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,750
Don't you see what I'm doing?

23
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,875
I didn't mean to.

24
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,291
Ouch.

25
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,375
Are you okay?

26
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,541
It's okay.

27
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,166
The medicine is kicking in now.

28
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,333
Good stuff.

29
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,916
It feels so tight.

30
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:23,166
Let go! Let go!

31
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,625
My head!

32
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,208
-How is my head!
-It's stuck.

33
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,041
The needle is gone.

34
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,041
All gone.

35
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,333
Ouch!

36
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,250
-Mui
-The needle!

37
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:06,958
Mui.

38
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,583
Do you remember when
you were a volleyball coach?

39
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,708
Of course.

40
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,208
It was exactly like this.

41
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,833
1996

42
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,083
Prayuth!

43
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,791
Avoid the blockers.

44
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,791
Enough, enough.

45
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,166
Everybody goes over there.

46
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,125
Go receive the serves.

47
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,958
Work more on the basics,
attacking and digging.

48
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,500
Come on.

49
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,583
Let's go.

50
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,375
Come on.

51
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,041
Push it. Don't dawdling.

52
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,541
Ready!

53
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,166
Ready?

54
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,041
In two rows.

55
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,166
First to receive the serves.

56
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,375
Second to attack.

57
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,291
Setters, do your job.

58
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,291
Okay?

59
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,000
Very good.

60
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,666
Focus on the first ball.

61
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,750
Focus on spiking.

62
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,833
-Shit!
-There he is.

63
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,166
On the line, not on my face!

64
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,750
Mui, sister!

65
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,208
Seriously, Coach Bee?

66
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,208
We're in competition!

67
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,666
-Really?
-Come to Lampang.

68
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,041
Yes, yes, yes.

69
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,875
When should I get to Lampang?

70
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,500
Immediately.

71
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,750
Yes.

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,083
Let me gather the team members.

73
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,166
Please prepare the application form.

74
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,958
-We'll see you there.
-See you.

75
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,708
See? We never fool you, Mui.

76
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,791
You go get your girls.

77
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:07,500
I'll go get mine. On the move!

78
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,750
Yes mama!

79
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,208
Mama my ass!

80
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:12,916
Just sister will do.

81
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,208
Yes, Sister Mama!

82
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,250
Move, out of the way, move.

83
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:23,208
Don't want to get hurt,
give me the way, let's move.

84
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,583
Trolley is hard, your feet hurt
when they get run over, man!

85
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,375
Khan Tok, you work hard, don't you?

86
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,125
No work, no food, aunty.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,625
-Bro.
-Bro my ass, I'm a beauty!

88
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,458
Here.

89
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,125
You have such a foul mouth.

90
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,250
I just want to slap those lips of yours.

91
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,416
Why?

92
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,083
Do you know aunty Nok?

93
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,708
Sure, I see her everyday.

94
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,041
She talks shit about you.
That you're an old desperate tranny.

95
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,041
You'll die from AIDS.

96
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,000
What?

97
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,083
You slept with all boys in the market.

98
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,583
Even with the dustmen.

99
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,500
Nok!

100
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,125
Come on. Talk to yourself.

101
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,500
Calm... down

102
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,750
-Calm down.
-There, very good.

103
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,375
Shit! Which way?

104
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,458
This way.

105
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,666
Bastard! I am invincible.

106
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,750
All ten of you will be dead!

107
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,750
-Aunty Nok!
-What now?

108
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,791
-When will you die?
-What's up with that? Wanna be slapped?

109
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,375
That blond bitch said.

110
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,416
That grey-haired tranny? What did she say?

111
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,416
She said you...

112
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,916
You have diabetes, and hyper tension.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,041
Plus, you'll die from cancer.

114
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,000
Damn, still following me?

115
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,000
Hey, stop there.

116
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,541
Must be his first.

117
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,916
Cucumber, bitter gourd, luffa, eggplant.

118
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,708
Do you know how I feel?

119
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,083
So enjoyable.

120
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,125
Should have tried that a long time ago.

121
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,375
It's awesome.

122
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,541
Can you come back?

123
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,333
Come back to me.

124
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,333
Ouch, it hurts like hell.

125
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,958
Si, you old queer.

126
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,916
How dare you say I'll die from cancer?

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,041
You know so well,
why don't you examine me?

128
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,166
You talk shit first.

129
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,708
You said I have HIV, I sleep with all men.

130
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,416
You are an attention seeker,
I never see you do any work.

131
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
What's the problem then?
Jealous of my beauty?

132
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,416
But you started this, right?

133
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,958
Khan Tok told me.

134
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:29,250
Same here.
You said I'll die from cancer, diabetes.

135
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,625
Khan Tok told me too.

136
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,750
Khan Tok again?

137
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,875
Khan Tok!

138
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,291
Yes, dear?

139
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,375
Move away, move away.

140
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,875
Hey! Wait!

141
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,125
Pak, Jung. What are you doing here?

142
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,666
We've come for you.

143
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,666
I don't get it, forget it. Come this way.

144
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,875
What? Sis, wait!

145
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,791
Wait up!

146
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,583
Here she comes.

147
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,916
Thidatep, hello.

148
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,833
Where did you learn English, so good!

149
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:42,166
I don't even understand
what I've just said.

150
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,000
But he can reply, I'm confused too.

151
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,000
He is a nutcase.

152
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,333
Okay!

153
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,583
What do you two want from me?

154
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,708
We want to...

155
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,208
Wait, let me finish this.

156
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,125
He is waiting on my cucumber.
Just five minutes.

157
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,166
What do you want?

158
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,583
We'd like to ask you to join
the volleyball team.

159
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,416
-Come together.
-Please, Please, please.

160
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,208
Like always. Just call me when.

161
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,958
Okay.

162
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,875
You bitch...

163
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,416
Hello?

164
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Hello, Man?

165
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,833
Mui, what's up?

166
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:27,916
I'd like to tell you ...

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,625
the Iron Ladies will come back again.

168
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,708
You go gather our friends.

169
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,583
Okay, no problem.

170
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,208
I'm playing cards now. Later.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,958
Man!

172
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,291
Nine-nine!

173
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,791
Yes! Come on!

174
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,000
Here for one game.

175
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:48,958
Here, here.

176
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Come on, hurry up.

177
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,708
I told you I'm gambling, what now?

178
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,083
This is police speaking.

179
00:10:56,166 --> 00:11:00,125
What? I'm not going to Poland.
I'm busy, later.

180
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,041
-I'm waiting, want another card?
-No.

181
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,541
Looking good.

182
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,250
Boat, did you order food?

183
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,916
That might be the delivery boy.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,291
It's all looking good, damn it.

185
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,875
Now, now.

186
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,500
Fine.

187
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,375
Ugh, this is crap.

188
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:18,750
Hello.

189
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,083
Police!

190
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,458
We are very excited now.

191
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:20,791
From 11 contestants, there will
be only three left at the final.

192
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,375
Which number?

193
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,500
Which one?

194
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,625
Number... number...

195
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,916
Twenty!

196
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Congratulations! 20 is going
through to the final.

197
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,708
Two more to go.

198
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,125
Well, now we are going to the questions.

199
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,416
We start with number 20.

200
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,291
And your question is...

201
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:37,458
Where is the first 7-Eleven's branch
in Thailand?

202
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,916
Answer it.

203
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,125
It's...

204
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,250
Where?

205
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,000
on the ground.

206
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,250
It's on the ground, is that correct?

207
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,416
Correct.

208
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,208
-Please, a round of applause.
-You are smart.

209
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:56,250
Next is number 32. Please step out.

210
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,208
Your question is easy.

211
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,666
The contest tonight...

212
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,625
What is the name of tonight's contest?

213
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,583
It's...

214
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,000
What's the name?

215
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,541
You can't chose who to be born as,
but you can be a good person. Thanks.

216
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,000
Well...

217
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,250
No need to answer to the right question,
thank you.

218
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,375
Number 100.

219
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,750
Why were you born... I'm sorry.

220
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,333
Who were you born as?

221
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,458
Thank you for your question.

222
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,083
When we see the silver linings,

223
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,041
Thai queers will rise.

224
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:36,083
Our land is so rich, Thai girls will rise.

225
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,083
What's the question again?

226
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,291
You haven't answered?

227
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,375
Pun Pun. Pun!

228
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,708
Man!

229
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,291
Mui wants you to join the team again.

230
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,458
-Really?
-Yes.

231
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,708
Pun!

232
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,833
What's wrong? We are all working here.

233
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,833
Why are you screaming?

234
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,291
Nothing, Mama.

235
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,250
Then tell me why.

236
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,708
Man asked me to join the volleyball team.

237
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,291
Man asked you to play volleyball?

238
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,416
Hello, Mama.

239
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,291
There is no man here.

240
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,750
How about your cabaret show?

241
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,833
I'll come back. I can do both.

242
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,250
-How could you do both?
-Please.

243
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,958
Who will perform then?

244
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,208
Mama, I'll take her place.

245
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,166
Say that again.

246
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,750
I'm leaving now. Bye.

247
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,708
Pun.

248
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:30,625
And the winner of 1996 is...

249
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,166
Number 100.

250
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,916
Please, a round of applause.

251
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,083
Congratulations.

252
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,125
Actually, this one is the runner-up.

253
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,416
Now, please welcome Lady Bygone.

254
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,541
She presents the prestigious crown
to our winner.

255
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:51,500
Please present the crown.

256
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,208
Don't freak out.

257
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:57,500
Sorry, just the crown, not with the tray.

258
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,916
Give her the crown,
give me back the container.

259
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,208
Give her the crown.

260
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,250
The judges must have bad eyes.

261
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,041
Say what?

262
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,958
Nothing.

263
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,250
Let's take photos.

264
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,416
Oh my God!

265
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,291
Why did you do this?

266
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,000
Are you alright?

267
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,041
Oh my god. What happened?

268
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,166
The beauty has become a frog now, look!

269
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,708
Nu, sis!

270
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,625
Don't be upset. The judges have no taste.

271
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,708
If you go to Miss Universe...

272
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,250
same year as Pornthip.

273
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,208
You'll beat her.

274
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,708
Really?

275
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,625
Sure, you are the prettiest.

276
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:09,000
I thought it was only me
that believe that.

277
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,000
You do, too.

278
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,208
How about...

279
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,041
you come play volleyball with us?

280
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,291
We will win this for sure.

281
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,125
You are a good player, and beautiful.

282
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,541
Please, please.

283
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,250
Fine.

284
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,208
Yes.

285
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,291
Tom! Tom!

286
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,791
Yes, Ma.

287
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,000
Your friend is here.

288
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:28,958
Man!

289
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,416
How are you? Haven't seen you a while.
Is everything okay?

290
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,875
Mui wants you to get back
to play volleyball.

291
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,458
Iron Ladies will compete again.

292
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,958
Iron Ladies! Jung and Dow are joining too?

293
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,541
Yes.

294
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,625
What are you doing?

295
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,958
Why do you have to hold his hands?

296
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,916
What's the matter?

297
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,791
I can hold his hands too, no problem.

298
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,166
-I better go.
-Good bye, good bye.

299
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:01,250
Ma, do you want me to have a heart attack?

300
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,791
Do you want me to die?

301
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,333
You are crazy.

302
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,875
Let's go back to your room.

303
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,958
Dig.

304
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,958
Come in.

305
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,125
Pun!

306
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,333
Man!

307
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,708
I have...

308
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,666
What?

309
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,125
-Where are you?
-They came after me in four rooms...

310
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,916
And you know what?

311
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,166
-Hey!
-You can't.

312
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,750
-This one.
-No, No, no.

313
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,125
Bitches!

314
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,958
Mama? I didn't really see you.

315
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,375
There you are.

316
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,333
You look like one of them Storm-Riders.

317
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,583
Mama, greetings.

318
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,500
Greetings to you too.

319
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,250
I have good news.
We will go to Lampang in two days.

320
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,833
Coach Bee invites our team...
to represent Lampang.

321
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,416
Hello, everyone.

322
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,916
Wait! Stop, stop, stop.

323
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,041
Chart, my dear Chart.

324
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,750
Still fit like always.

325
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:24,875
Chart!

326
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,666
Khan Tok, get away.

327
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,416
Chart!

328
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,250
My dear Chart.

329
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,791
Muah!

330
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,875
I've missed you.

331
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,666
Chart.

332
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,750
Who is that, Chart?

333
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,958
My girlfriend.

334
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,916
-Your girlfriend?
-Yes.

335
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,375
-Really, Chart?
-Yes.

336
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,041
Bad taste.

337
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,500
-This is your girlfriend?
-Pathetic.

338
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,541
Skin is damn rough.

339
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,291
I am much prettier.

340
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,166
Yeah, seriously...

341
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,958
Are you a human or giant?

342
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:05,875
Who are you talking about?

343
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,041
You.

344
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,291
Oh, no!

345
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,333
Not true, not true, not true.

346
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,583
No.

347
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,083
Come on now. Stop it.

348
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,500
Pack up! Let's go to Lampang.

349
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,750
Lampang!

350
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:29,375
Lampang. Lampang. Lampang.

351
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,208
LAMPANG PROVINCE

352
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,041
Jung! Jung!

353
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,250
Kham.

354
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,250
Jung.

355
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,208
Kham.

356
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,166
Come on, hurry up.

357
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,333
It's so cold.

358
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:47,833
And coach Bee?

359
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,333
Coach Bee?

360
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,666
Coach Bee asked us to welcome you.

361
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,250
-I see.
-Hello.

362
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

363
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,291
Shall we go?

364
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,625
Let's go.

365
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,916
Let's get going.

366
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,500
-Go!
-Hurry

367
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:06,041
Lampang. Lampang. Lampang.

368
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,916
We are just friends.

369
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,208
Lampang. Lampang. Lampang.

370
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:16,125
Lampang. Lampang. Lampang.

371
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,416
Hey, you guys!

372
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,291
Are you not embarrassed?

373
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,791
Nothing is more embarrassing
than our outfits.

374
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,500
Whatever.

375
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,541
-And you're so damn pretty?
-She's jealous.

376
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,791
Lampang. Lampang. Lampang.

377
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,833
Stick with me, I'm embarrased.

378
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,750
To Boonyawas.

379
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,041
Follow me this way.

380
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:43,333
Jung, how do you know Coach Bee?

381
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,833
Since I was in high school.

382
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,458
I was her student.
She was a volleyball coach.

383
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,541
Then I went to university in Bangkok.

384
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,833
Lampang. Lampang. Lampang.

385
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,625
-Jung.
-Yes?

386
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,125
What is Coach Bee like?

387
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,583
Coach Bee...

388
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,000
She is kind. But she is a dyke.

389
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,458
Oh...

390
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,625
-Really?
-Yes.

391
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,583
Is she cute?

392
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,500
Not really. It's just that...

393
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,333
you never see
the same girl come to see her at school.

394
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,375
-Really?
-Yes.

395
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:24,916
And some days,
there were four or five girls.

396
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,041
And they fought over her at school.

397
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,750
Really?

398
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:29,750
Really.

399
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,000
Bro, can you get Coach Bee?

400
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,458
Alright. I'll tell her you guys are here.

401
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,541
Okay. Let's go.

402
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,750
Thanks.

403
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,041
Bitch, always getting horny.

404
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,208
I wanna see Coach Bee.

405
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,583
Here, they want to see you.

406
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,000
Eh...?

407
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,500
Thank you, kids.

408
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,291
-My pleasure.
-Thank you.

409
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,916
Coach Boo, who wants to see me?

410
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,333
I don't know. Your friend?

411
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,375
Hmm.

412
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,541
-This is refreshing.
-It's tasty.

413
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,083
Jung!

414
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,916
Coach Bee!

415
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,833
-Hello!
-Hello!

416
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,916
Hi!

417
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,416
These are the friends you told me about?

418
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,833
Yes, Coach Bee.

419
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,708
Whoa...

420
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:47,250
They look strong. Which one is Mui?

421
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:48,708
I'm here.

422
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,083
Nice to meet you.

423
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,375
Hello.

424
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,083
Hey, I have a class.

425
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,416
Okay, Coach Boo.

426
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,291
There are only dykes here.

427
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,000
-Don't call them dykes. It's bad.
-What should we call them?

428
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,666
Girls, go get change.

429
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,083
And show me what you've got, okay?

430
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,583
Yes!

431
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,208
Do your best!

432
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,333
Coach Bee.

433
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,416
The headmaster wants to see you.

434
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:16,583
I'll catch up.

435
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,500
-Who?
-Kham, Khai.

436
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,666
Take them to get changed
and go to the gym.

437
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,625
And see you there.

438
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,041
Yes, coach.

439
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,166
-Do your best!
-Yes!

440
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,750
Now, Coach Bee!

441
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,875
I have something to talk to you about.

442
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:42,666
Yes, sir.

443
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,333
What is it?

444
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:49,416
About the volleyball players
for our province.

445
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:54,416
I have them all, full team.

446
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,458
Don't you think that your players...

447
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,291
They are homosexuals.

448
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:04,625
What are you thinking?

449
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:07,666
Wait, sir.

450
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,750
What is wrong with them?

451
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,750
They just can't chose
who they are born to be.

452
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:18,125
And there is no gender limit
in volleyball.

453
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:21,083
They only need to be skillful, right?

454
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:24,083
You know, if they compete...

455
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,791
they will bring us bad names.

456
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,500
People would think that volleyball...

457
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,291
is the sport of the queers.

458
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,125
You should think about it.

459
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,458
I insist.

460
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:38,666
I will use this team.

461
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,166
And there won't be any changes.

462
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,541
You are stubborn,
you will bring us all down.

463
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,041
But I'm not surprised.

464
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:49,750
You are one of them too.

465
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:56,166
Sir, we'll see. This team of ladies...

466
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,166
or the queers as you say...

467
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,166
We'll see how well they perform.

468
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,791
I will make them the champion
of region five.

469
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:07,416
Wait and see.

470
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,041
If there is nothing else,
may I excuse myself?

471
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,416
Oh, there is no space there.

472
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,375
Thank you, Deung.

473
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,750
Whatever your skills are, show it...

474
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,291
So I'll know.

475
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:37,708
Show me the best in you.

476
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:39,000
Yes.

477
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,208
Wait.

478
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:45,166
This, I wanna have but I don't wanna see.

479
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,708
I mean, your skill. Show it.

480
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,500
Yes!

481
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,500
Do your best!

482
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:52,750
Yes!

483
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,458
Then... let's begin!

484
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,041
Not this way, that way.

485
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:06,250
Help me!

486
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:48,833
Iron Ladies!

487
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,125
So good! You are so good!

488
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,250
Come on here.

489
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,916
There was no team as good as we are.

490
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,916
We will be the champion.

491
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:07,458
Let's get something to eat at my place.
My treat.

492
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:08,791
Let's go!

493
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,375
Let's go! Let's go!

494
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:18,750
Hey, bring me down!

495
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,333
Hey!

496
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,250
Are we there yet?

497
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,750
There is a giant sausage at this shop.

498
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,625
Sausage my ass, we'll get there in a bit.

499
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:37,708
Here is her shop. "Get Rich".

500
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:39,541
Come in.

501
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:41,625
Let's go in.

502
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,416
-Take a seat.
-Hurry up.

503
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,791
Where is food. I can't eat tables.

504
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,083
Take a seat, here.

505
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,333
Your balls. Don't flash them.

506
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:56,166
Come on.

507
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,291
It's damn far. My legs are short.

508
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:02,833
Nu, order the sausage.

509
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:04,791
Eat your own first. It's flashing.

510
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,833
Crap! I went past it.

511
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:07,833
Ugh!

512
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:14,291
Why didn't you wait for me?
I couldn't catch up.

513
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,458
You have short steps.

514
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,500
We are hungry.

515
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,958
Application form, miss.

516
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:26,666
Very well.
Everybody, check your photo and last name.

517
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,708
Let me know if there are mistakes.

518
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:29,958
Beautiful!

519
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,291
Pass it on.

520
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:32,958
I'm the prettiest.

521
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,916
So pretty! Look at my face.

522
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,291
Check!

523
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,458
Great! I look pretty.

524
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,875
-Angel!
-Pretty girl!

525
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:45,208
All correct?

526
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,500
-Keep it.
-Yes.

527
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,458
Hey, Sin, is it ready?

528
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:49,541
I think so.

529
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:51,083
You think so?

530
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,083
-I'm hungry!
-Me too!

531
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,541
-Hungry!
-Hungry!

532
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,125
Calm down. Calm down.

533
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:01,500
Kham, Khai, bring out the food.

534
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:02,833
They could eat a buff.

535
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:12,958
Buffalo.

536
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:14,833
I mean buffalo.

537
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,250
-That one with the horns.
-Buffalo.

538
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,375
Here comes the food.

539
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,500
Put them down.

540
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,416
Over here, over here.

541
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
So many.

542
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,500
Give it to me.

543
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:39,333
Don't!

544
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,125
This food is divine.

545
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:49,166
You're eating all!

546
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,291
What's wrong?

547
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,833
-What is it?
-Nu?

548
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,000
Nothing is wrong?

549
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,916
You have bad breath.

550
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,625
Feed me.

551
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,291
Come on, guys.

552
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:02,916
-Awesome.
-So yummy.

553
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,416
You are not finished?

554
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,125
No, not yet. Just half full.

555
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:18,291
All your friends left.

556
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:26,958
Is your family that poor?

557
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,791
Take some more. Takeaway?
I'll bring some bags.

558
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:32,541
I'm full.

559
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:33,500
It tastes good, right?

560
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:34,666
I'm full.

561
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,833
Yeah, I get it.

562
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,583
We are finally here.

563
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,250
Jung.

564
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:53,208
They're booing us.

565
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:55,875
Screw them.

566
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,041
Faggot!

567
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,875
Everyone, stay calm. Fight!

568
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,583
Fight!

569
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:08,125
Coach, let me take the lead.

570
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,166
Boo!

571
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,916
Boys!

572
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:30,666
Give it to me.

573
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,500
Wait.

574
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:38,791
Why? There is nothing wrong.

575
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:41,750
They can apply, can't they?

576
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,125
Do what he said.

577
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,458
They told us to wait.

578
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:50,958
I want to slap her!

579
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,541
What's wrong?

580
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:25,583
What's wrong with you?

581
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,833
Where are they all gone?

582
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,041
You guys, look!

583
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:48,458
Boys...

584
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:55,458
Boys!

585
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:56,500
Boys, if I get them...

586
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,000
Me too! Me too!

587
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:07,500
The winning team from Chiang Mai.

588
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,625
Don't give up.

589
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,541
Let's compete against these boys instead.

590
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:13,708
Nu!

591
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:15,375
I'll eat them all.

592
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,625
You're hungry out of nowhere.

593
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:42,750
You're cute.

594
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:45,791
You're crazy.

595
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,750
I also have a face, you can look at me.

596
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,208
Sign them up.

597
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,666
You're so cute.

598
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:23,916
What's wrong with you?

599
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,708
And why don't you look at me?

600
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,125
Do I have a face?

601
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,083
Nu. Come back here.

602
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,375
I can't contain myself.

603
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:43,583
Can we apply for the competition now?

604
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,458
Why do we have to wait?

605
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,916
-Approved.
-Approved?

606
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,958
We are in! We are in!

607
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,833
Where are you?

608
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:16,916

609
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,041
Khan Tok!

610
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:19,583
Come on, sis.

611
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,000
Guys!

612
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,541
Mui, I'm tired.

613
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,416
Stop, stop.

614
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,458
Girls, I have a dream.

615
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,416
One day I will count down to
the New Year over there.

616
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:37,166
If you guys win this match,

617
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,041
We'll have a party on the hill.

618
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:37,250
Hey!

619
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,291
Hey, hey.Concentrate.

620
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,958
Hit it. Hit it.

621
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:25,958
Coach Bee.

622
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:27,791
Win this match.

623
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,375
Of course, we will.

624
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,125
We sure will. Piece of cake.

625
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:03,916
Hello.

626
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:06,833

Hurry up.

629
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:15,500

We won!
We're gonna have a party on the hill.

00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,791
And celebrate New Years.

654
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,166
To the hill! To the hill! To the hill!

655
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,541
To the hill! To the hill! To the hill!

656
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:09,000
Wait. Wait. Wait.

657
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:12,208
I can't go. I have something to do.

658
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:14,458
If you can’t, it'd be so much fun.

659
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:19,708
To the hill!

660
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:24,500
We're following our dreams.

661
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:27,166
We're celebrating the victory...

662
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,250
On the hill!

663
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:35,666
It's a pity Coach Bee can't come with us.

664
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:40,083
She is handling the match in Nakhonsawan.

665
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:43,375
And she's too old,
she can't walk this far.

666
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,500
Parn.

667
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:47,250
What the heck am I carrying? So heavy.

668
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:53,291
Hi.

669
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,500
Tonight, we're celebrating...

670
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:58,750
Our great endeavor that made us win

671
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:01,083
and become region five's winning team.

672
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,875
And we're gonna celebrate the New Year.

673
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:07,916
Tonight,
we're bringing you an entertainment.

674
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,250
Enjoy the show!

675
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:23,000
When will you reach the blocking? Huh?

676
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:26,250
You kicked me like I was a frog.
Just tell me nicely.

677
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,916
Don't look right here
Don't look right here

678
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,791
You're making a big deal

679
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:55,875
Don't look at me like that
Don't look at me like that

680
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:59,500
If you wanna love me, make it real

681
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:03,250
Don't look right here
Don't look right here

682
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,750
You're making a big deal

683
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:10,708
Don't look at me like that
Don't look at me like that

684
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:14,208
If you wanna love me, make it real

685
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,125
Don't look right here
Don't look right here

686
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:21,666
You're making a big deal

687
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:25,500
Don't look at me like that
Don't look at me like that

688
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:27,916
If you wanna love me, make it real

689
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:54,333
May our team...
win the next match in Nakhonsawan.

690
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,000
Sap peh sat ta...

691
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,125
That's a prayer for the dead.

692
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:14,166
Was I so wrong that you gotta slap me?

693
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:25,083
Please bless us
with victory for this game.

694
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:39,500
Good night.

695
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:40,583
-Let's go.
-Bye bye.

696
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:45,208
Can I sleep with you?

697
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,250
Dear God Guan Yu,

698
00:46:56,333 --> 00:47:00,833
please bless us with happiness.

699
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:04,375
Please bless us with good health.

700
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:07,958
Please bless us with fortune.

701
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:10,916
Most of all, I wish for my son

702
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,708
to be grateful of his family.

703
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:19,125
May he be good and well-behaved.

704
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:23,416
Most importantly, God Guan Yu.

705
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,625
I'd like to make a wish.

706
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:30,125
Stop him from hanging out with queers.

707
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:33,208
Prevent him from being a homosexual.

708
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:36,583
Mhuay, why did you say that?

709
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:38,541
Why?

710
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:41,875
Mama, I'm making a wish.

711
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:45,416
It's nothing to do with you.
You're upsetting me.

712
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,166
You spoke so loud. I heard that.

713
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,083
Tom is sitting right here.

714
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:54,833
So? Are you gay?

715
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,208
No, I'm not.

716
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:01,791
Tom, pot the incense sticks.
We finished now.

717
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:04,041
Pot them.

718
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,916
JUNGKOCHIKA RESTAURANT

719
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Are you sure that this is Jung's house?

720
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:09,541
Yes, Coach Bee.

721
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:13,541
There it is. Jungkochika Restaurant.

722
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:17,333
If you think it is, call him out.

723
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:20,541
Jung!

724
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,166
Is anybody home?

725
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,916
Who is it? Why are you yelling?

726
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:31,666
Who are you here for?

727
00:48:58,208 --> 00:48:59,083
Who are you here for?

728
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:00,208
Hello, I...

729
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:02,000
Hey! Are you trying
to sell me a water filter?

730
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,000
No. I already have one.

731
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,541
No, I'm not. I'm here to...

732
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:07,583
Ask me for some money?

733
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:10,750
Old trick.
You missed your bus and need money.

734
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:13,291
No. I won’t give you any.

735
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,791
Hello, I'm Coach Bee.

736
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:18,833
I came from Lampang to meet Jung.

737
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:20,208
Coach Eew!

738
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:25,666
Oh it's you. Hello, Coach Eew.

739
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,541
No, Mom. This is Coach Bee.

740
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:30,750
She's Coach Eew. I know.

741
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,750
Jung talks a lot about you, Coach Eew.

742
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:35,708
Come in. Get inside the house.

743
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:37,750
Come on, come in. Come in.

744
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,291
Wait, Mom.

745
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:40,625
It's locked.

746
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:41,875
I forgot.

747
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:57,583
I've got it. Here.

748
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,083
Here you are.

749
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,041
I don't remember which key is which.
Try it.

750
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:10,375
Come in, coach.

751
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,416
Coach Bee, take it easy.

752
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,583
Jung went out practicing. She'll be back.

753
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:17,791
She goes out everyday.

754
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:18,958
That's alright.

755
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:21,583
Aren't you from the North?

756
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:25,041
I was born in Udonthani,
but now teaching in Lampang.

757
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:27,375
An Udonian. Where do you live?

758
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:28,541
Wang Sam Mor.

759
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:31,958
We're neighbors!

760
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,291
I'm from Pattani.

761
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:38,708
I was born in Pattani
but I grew up in Maha Sarakham.

762
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:39,875
Which district were you in?

763
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:41,125
Bor Krabue

764
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:42,458
Bor Krabue?

765
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,250
I go there often.

766
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,958
I go there to sell my buff.

767
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:50,000
Everyone wanna buy my buff?

768
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:52,250
You don't need to go
to Bor Karbue to get one.

769
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,666
We have ones around here.

770
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:02,666
Yes, we have one around here.

771
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:08,791
Jung, Dao. Coach Eew is waiting for you.

772
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,125
Coach Bee! Hello.

773
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:13,166
Hello.

774
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,500
I need to go to the loo.

775
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,833
That explains a lot.

776
00:51:19,916 --> 00:51:22,458
We all miss you, Coach Bee.

777
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:24,500
I thought you'd come earlier.

778
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:26,458
What took you so long?

779
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,291
I've just got the time.

780
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:37,125
-Kam!
-Jung!

781
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:40,958
What are you doing here?

782
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:44,166
To find something to eat in the toilet?

783
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,958
So cute. You're here to meet me.

784
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,458
Do you miss me?

785
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,791
A bit.

786
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:55,500
What's wrong with you?

787
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,916
I'm going to pee.

788
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:04,500
Hey!

789
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:14,125
Dao, tell the girls to meet me here.

790
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:15,333
Okay.

791
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:18,208
Coach Eew, are you spending a night here?

792
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:22,041
Yes, ma'am.

793
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:25,875
You must have traveled a long way.

794
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,166
To our happiness.

795
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,125
Same here, Coach Eew.

796
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,875
-It's Coach Bee.
-Alright.

797
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:38,125
Madame Jang.

798
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,125
Yes?

799
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:40,875
How many people live in this house?

800
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,583
Just the two of us.

801
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:44,125
-My son and..
-You.

802
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,125
Mother and son. Alright, alright.

803
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,708
How long have you two lived here?

804
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,291
A long time. Since...

805
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:56,625
Since Jung was young, right?

806
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:03,666
If I wanna ask you about your love life,

807
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:05,208
Would you mind?

808
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:07,166
No. You can ask me.

809
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,041
Well... Umm...

810
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:13,791
What's your type?

811
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,916
My type?

812
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:23,541
I like short and bulky guy.

813
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,750
And he's working in...

814
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:27,041
Lampang?

815
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:28,333
Lampang!

816
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,500
I live in Lampang.

817
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:33,500
Cheers! Cheers.

818
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:35,208
My pleasure.

819
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:40,333
-Madame Jang.
-Yes?

820
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:42,083
Do you remember what I told you?

821
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,791
About my buff.

822
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,291
I wanna tell you that my buff is strong.

823
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,958
Big. Tough. Rough.

824
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:52,750
Do you have a lot of buffs?

825
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:55,541
I have a pen full of them.

826
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:57,083
They're all over my field.

827
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,416
-A lot of buffs.
-A lot.

828
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,333
You can't sell them out. No.

829
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:02,958
You can't sell them out, huh?

830
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:05,166
No, I can't. Cheers. Cheers.

831
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,583
-Cheers! Cheers! one, two, three!
-A lot of them.

832
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:12,958
-Madame Jang.
-Yes?

833
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,291
I...

834
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:15,791
I think...

835
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:19,791
-Will you be my...
-Mom

836
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:21,708
There are more orders.

837
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:25,291
You don't need to ask me anything.

838
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,583
Customers are calling. Excuse me.

839
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:28,875
Mom, hurry up.

840
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:30,041
Madame Jang.

841
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:32,208
Madame Jang.

842
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,708
Madame Jang.

843
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:36,583
Madame Jang!

844
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:41,250
Just a second longer
and I would have gotten her.

845
00:54:42,791 --> 00:54:43,833
Coach Bee.

846
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,250
Coach Bee.

847
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:47,583
I'll take you to your room.

848
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:49,375
Madame Jang...

849
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,208
Madame Jang...

850
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:55,041
Madame Jang, can I touch your boob?

851
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,166
I'm not Madame Jang.

852
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,250
Can I touch you?

853
00:54:58,333 --> 00:54:59,708
That's my cabbage, coach!

854
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:02,083
I want you to see my buff.

855
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,000
My buff is huge.

856
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,250
As huge as a rocket.

857
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:08,333
It can shoot up to the sky.

858
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,166
Ball two. Ball two.

859
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,166
Nu!

860
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,125
Set!

861
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:14,250
Attack!

862
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:17,208
Good. Good. Good.

863
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,166
Tom.

864
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:19,375
Yes, Mui?

865
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:20,708
Why didn't you come to practice?

866
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:24,041
I was busy with school.

867
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:25,791
Busy with school?

868
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,708
You can come here after school.

869
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:32,833
Mui, I have a problem with my mother.

870
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:36,916
Tom.

871
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:40,791
You can tell me anything.

872
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:42,875
Thank you, Mui.

873
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,083
Go practicing.

874
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:54,250
Dig it.

875
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,208
Ball!

876
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:56,250
Let go!

877
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:57,208
Khan Tok!

878
00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:59,041
Khan Tok!

879
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:00,000
Yes?

880
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:01,291
Dig it well.

881
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,666
Come here.

882
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,250
Hurry up.

883
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:05,458
Keep practicing.

884
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,083
-Come, come.
-Come on.

885
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:08,083
What's the matter, Mui?

886
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:09,541
Can I ask you something?

887
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:11,750
Where's Noina?

888
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:15,333
I don't know.
I don't sleep and eat with him.

889
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:16,375
Yeah?

890
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:18,583
Are you having a problem with Noina?

891
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:22,291
I swear.
I don't have any problem with him.

892
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:24,750
Up to you. Go practice.

893
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:28,041
-Noina!
-What's the matter?

894
00:56:28,291 --> 00:56:29,291
Sure you're not having a fight with him?

895
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:32,750
There's nothing.
Why are you asking me so much?

896
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:35,375
Bitch!

897
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:37,333
Totally no suspicion!

898
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:39,250
Parn.

899
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,916
Mui.

900
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,333
Coach Bee got here from Lampang.

901
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:46,208
She's now staying with Jung.

902
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:48,791
She told me she wanted to meet our team.

903
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:50,625
Tonight, Mui.

904
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,791
Alright. But...

905
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:56,083
Put your bags in the lockers
and go practice.

906
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:58,750
No privilege. Go!

907
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,625
Alright.

908
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:03,958
Parn, attack!

909
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,000
Let go!

910
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:07,875
Dig it!

911
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:09,750
Anyone wanna take a break?

912
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:10,791
Jung.

913
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:12,208
-Go on.
-Okay.

914
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:14,125
-Parn.
-Six people here!

915
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:15,666
Three back, three front.

916
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:27,208
I'd like to make a wish.

917
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:31,833
Stop him from hanging out with queers.

918
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:35,333
Prevent him from being a homosexual.

919
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:40,000
Welcome Coach Bee to Bangkok. Cheers!

920
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:43,083
Cheers!

921
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:46,583
Yay for Coach Bee. Cheers!

922
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:48,791
So happy Coach Bee is here. Cheers!

923
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,708
-Hi.
-Chart, Joy. Come sit here.

924
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,458
Chart is here.

925
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,333
He is fucking here.

926
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,583
Parn, you cheeky bitch. Get out!

927
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,291
Now!

928
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:09,166
-Joy, Come sit here.
-Here.

929
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,458
So cheeky. Sit.

930
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:11,625
Here.

931
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,416
When are you getting married?

932
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:17,208
Where did you pick her up?

933
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:19,833
Since we are all here...

934
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:21,875
Let's drink.

935
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:25,500
Cheers!

936
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:31,458
I have come here for two reasons.

937
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,666
First, let me say...

938
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,000
Jung, you are pretty like your mother.

939
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:39,416
Thank you, Coach Bee.

940
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:43,375
Next, it's serious.

941
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:47,083
I know the schedule

942
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:49,375
of "Paknampho Games"

943
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:51,041
There are four regions.

944
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:53,666
First is region nine, Pattalung.
Don't worry.

945
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,291
Second is region six, Nakornsawan.

946
00:58:56,375 --> 00:59:00,291
Third is region ten, Bangkok. Average.

947
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:04,333
The next is tough, they are very good.

948
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,541
It's region seven, Supanburi.

949
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:10,083
It's all up to us. Don't be afraid.

950
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:13,083
We have to train hard and stay strong.

951
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,083
The most important is,
we hold on together.

952
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:16,333
Hold on together!

953
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:17,875
Agreed!

954
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:21,208
Cheers!

955
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:24,208
Nu, music.

956
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:25,625
Yes, coach.

957
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,291
Faster.

958
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:29,833
Chart, try this.

959
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,125
Make yourself at home.

960
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,291
Music!

961
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:47,000
Nu. Stop it! Now!

962
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,791
Bitch!

963
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,666
Are there any other songs?

964
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:04,333
Coach Bee, I am taking off.

965
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:08,750
Where are you going?

966
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:10,666
I don't feel well.

967
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:16,041
Why don't you stay with us?

968
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:17,458
What's wrong with her?

969
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:18,583
She is not well.

970
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:19,791
What's wrong with her?

971
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,208
Mui.

972
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:26,541
Don't you worry about me.

973
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,375
You guys have fun.

974
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:33,958
Where are you going, Mui?

975
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:35,875
Must be a PMS thing.

976
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:37,208
Like your mother.

977
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:38,541
You talk shit about my mother?

978
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:40,166
Bitch!

979
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,458
Quiet now. Eat up.

980
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:43,208
Come on.

981
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,250
I don't think so...

982
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:02,583
Who is that?

983
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,875
It's Chart.

984
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:21,375
Come in.

985
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:36,500
What is it?

986
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:40,083
What's the matter?

987
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,166
Nothing.

988
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:46,291
Where's Joy?

989
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:48,208
I took her home already.

990
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:53,250
I'm just worried about you.

991
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:04,916
ROMANTIC BLUE

992
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,625
You like that movie?

993
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:11,750
Don't you?

994
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,458
I do. We went together, didn't we?

995
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,166
Mui, where are you going?

996
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:21,000
I’m going home.

997
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:22,375
Let's go out for dinner and a movie.

998
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:23,500
Really?

999
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:26,750
Yes, "Romantic Blue" is a big hit.

1000
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:28,500
You like Nook?

1001
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:30,375
No, I like Tao.

1002
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,041
And do you like me?

1003
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,291
Of course, that's why I invited you.
Let's go.

1004
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:37,916
Wait, wait, Chart.

1005
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:41,666
Uh...

1006
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:46,208
Chart.

1007
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:52,458
What do you think about me?

1008
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,041
I care about you.

1009
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:06,750
And love you...

1010
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,708
as a friend.

1011
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:11,041
Get some rest.

1012
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:14,708
I'll get going.

1013
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,291
Four hundred fifty, 451...

1014
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,250
Coach Bee, what are you doing?

1015
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,041
I like to exercise.

1016
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,958
I do four to five thousands a day,
you know.

1017
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:36,333
So strong.

1018
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:52,666
Don't look,
you'll be frightened of my face.

1019
01:04:55,916 --> 01:04:57,750
-Coach?
-Almost 6000 now.

1020
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:04,791
Coach?

1021
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:07,333
Coach Bee?

1022
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:09,916
-How are you?
-Stop talking. Lift me up.

1023
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:15,458
Why is it so hard to win over a girl?

1024
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:19,000
Take a seat.

1025
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:26,625
Seriously, am I good looking?

1026
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:28,583
The best.

1027
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:50,541
My mom and grandma are not home.

1028
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:26,041
Mama.

1029
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:30,791
Why isn't Tom home?

1030
01:06:31,416 --> 01:06:36,416
He said he has a meeting
at the university.

1031
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,583
It's just an excuse to stay out late.

1032
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:49,791
He said he has a meeting.

1033
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:51,708
He goes to study.

1034
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:55,291
Stop complaining, alright?

1035
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,166
Tom?

1036
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:22,791
What, Mama?

1037
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,000
Tom!

1038
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,000
What are you doing?

1039
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:29,291
Who the hell is he?

1040
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:32,375
Get out of my house! Get out!

1041
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:35,083
Mama, please. Don't!

1042
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:36,041
Mama, don't hurt me.

1043
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:37,791
Why?! Why?!

1044
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:39,000
Don't. Mama, stop!

1045
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:41,500
Muay, calm down.

1046
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:42,583
Muay!

1047
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:44,916
Our family name is ruined.

1048
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,166
We are all in shame.

1049
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,208
Muay, calm down.

1050
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:49,708
Think about it.

1051
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:50,875
Mama, please!

1052
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:52,291
You never listen to me.

1053
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:53,833
What do you want?

1054
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:56,500
You ungrateful child,
I'll beat you to death.

1055
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:57,750
Enough.

1056
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,083
Enough! Enough! Enough!

1057
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:01,500
Muay?

1058
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,708
Mama.

1059
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:10,750
Enough, he is still your son.

1060
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,791
Gay or queer, he is still your son.

1061
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,625
Mama, stop.

1062
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:18,500
-Go pack up.
-It hurts.

1063
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,625
Go pack up, and leave now.

1064
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:21,875
Get out, get out!

1065
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:23,500
Go, go, go.

1066
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:26,416
Go.

1067
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:35,583
Tom.

1068
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:36,875
Tom, sweetie.

1069
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:37,958
No.

1070
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:39,250
Tom, come here.

1071
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:45,625
Are you hurt?

1072
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:46,916
It hurts.

1073
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:06,500
Muay.

1074
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,958
What have I done wrong?

1075
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:23,875
Jung?

1076
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:27,500
-Dow?
-Yes, yes, I'm coming.

1077
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:36,125
What happened?

1078
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,375
Come in.

1079
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:44,750
Come on, don't cry.

1080
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:49,875
I'm worried for him.

1081
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:52,625
What a pity.

1082
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:56,916
It must be difficult if it was me.

1083
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:01,125
I don’t know what to do.

1084
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:03,000
His family doesn't understand him.

1085
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:05,208
Hello. Jung, where are you?

1086
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,958
Hello. I'm at the ground level.

1087
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:11,041
Here. I'm at the sign "Jung Kochika".

1088
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:13,291
Come on in.

1089
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,250
Hey.

1090
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:18,083
Open the door, Jim.

1091
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:20,916
Hey.

1092
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,916
-Miss you.
-Miss you.

1093
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:27,208
Come in here.

1094
01:10:27,916 --> 01:10:28,958
Let's go.

1095
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:32,750
Come on.

1096
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:35,541
With the up coming match,

1097
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:38,708
I don’t want us to get the hopes up.

1098
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:40,916
Winning or losing, it doesn't matter.

1099
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:45,041
What matters is,
will we be ready to fight?

1100
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:47,708
We have to train hard to get ready.

1101
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:50,833
No absence, no days off.

1102
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:53,958
Because the competition is getting closer.

1103
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,666
Hey.

1104
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:03,458
Leg...

1105
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:05,250
At my face.

1106
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:06,291
Sorry.

1107
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:08,875
Every matches we will be in from now.

1108
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:10,333
We do our best.

1109
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:11,541
Yes!

1110
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:18,875
Noina. Where have you been?
I haven't seen you around.

1111
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:20,416
You'll know soon.

1112
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:22,750
Let me talk to this bitch first.

1113
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:24,583
Come here.

1114
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,291
Alright, let's warm up.

1115
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:46,833
Let's go practise.

1116
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:50,125
Do you remember that night?

1117
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:53,583
On the mountain, in the tent.

1118
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:08,541
Let's try it without the glasses.

1119
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:19,958
So ugly, I better put them back on.

1120
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,291
Why the hell do you stop?

1121
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:29,541
Lift both legs, that's how it's done.

1122
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:30,500
Alright.

1123
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,208
Shit. The pants are still on.

1124
01:12:38,625 --> 01:12:40,208
So torturing.

1125
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:43,750
So agonising.

1126
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:47,583
So pleasurable.

1127
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,041
So magnificent.

1128
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:52,958
Super satisfying!

1129
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:57,041
Well...

1130
01:12:57,458 --> 01:13:00,208
I was drunk. I didn't mean to.

1131
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:03,583
Didn't mean to?

1132
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:06,041
You were up all night.

1133
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,500
You screwed me, Khan Tok.

1134
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:10,708
So...

1135
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:13,958
You have to take responsibility.

1136
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:16,791
Are you pregnant?

1137
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:20,125
Pregnant my ass, I haven't pooped
for weeks. I only ate fried pork.

1138
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:22,833
I am in so much pain because of you.

1139
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:24,916
You have to take responsibility.

1140
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:28,666
Enough. Let's go practice.

1141
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,125
You have to take responsibility.

1142
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:34,458
I said practice first and talk later.

1143
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:36,500
You want to practice?

1144
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:37,458
Yes.

1145
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:39,166
I'll do it too.

1146
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,625
But with you here, bitch!

1147
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,625
Khan Tok! Noina!

1148
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:45,625
You can't. My hair's all lubed up.

1149
01:13:46,166 --> 01:13:47,458
Stop now!

1150
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:49,791
Khan Tok, Noina!

1151
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:51,041
Hurry up.

1152
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:52,041
Stop it!

1153
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:53,625
Noina! Khan Tok!

1154
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:54,958
Noina, No!

1155
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:57,500
Stop! Stop!

1156
01:13:57,791 --> 01:13:58,916
Khan Tok, stop!

1157
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:04,208
Don't!

1158
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:07,541
Stop fighting.

1159
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:08,791
I said stop.

1160
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:10,291
I said stop, stop!

1161
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,833
Stop now!

1162
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:16,958
No? You won't? Then I will!

1163
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:20,000
Noina, stop! Stop!

1164
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:21,666
Let go.

1165
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:26,083
Let go of me!

1166
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:27,208
Hey!

1167
01:14:27,291 --> 01:14:29,083
Don't do that to her!

1168
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:31,250
Where is Mui?

1169
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,791
I'm leaving. You take care of them.

1170
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:35,833
Come on!

1171
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:37,958
No! Stop! Stop!

1172
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:39,750
Stop! Stop!

1173
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:41,791
Coach Bee!

1174
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:44,333
-What happened to her?
-I was hit on my face, bitch!

1175
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,625
Coach Bee?

1176
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:53,291
-Jung.
-Yes.

1177
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:54,583
I'm going back to Lampang.

1178
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:55,583
Yes.

1179
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:59,250
Tell Mui and everyone,
let's meet in Nakornsawan.

1180
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:01,125
I'll have everything prepared there.

1181
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:02,125
Yes, I will.

1182
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:03,458
Let's go.

1183
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:06,958
And your mother?

1184
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:10,958
Mom? Mommy?

1185
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:12,625
Yes, sweetie?

1186
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:16,375
Coach Bee is leaving.

1187
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:22,583
I'll go back to Lampang.

1188
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:23,791
I miss my buff.

1189
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:25,208
Nobody is taking care of it.

1190
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:29,125
If I have a chance, I'll show it to you.

1191
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:30,666
Don't forget to wash it.

1192
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,791
-Yes.
-And brush it sometimes.

1193
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:36,250
I have to tell you.

1194
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,916
I'll look much better next time.

1195
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,125
Good bye, Coach Eew.

1196
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:53,791
-Bye, Jung.
-Bye bye.

1197
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:58,041
Bye, Jung.

1198
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:07,916
Jung, give Coach Eew a ride.

1199
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:11,250
Coach Bee, I'll drive you there.

1200
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:20,458
Is it all you have now?

1201
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:23,708
Let's give a try, so you can see.

1202
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:29,625
Is it all you have now?

1203
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:31,166
Let's give a try...

1204
01:16:33,083 --> 01:16:34,208
Who is it?

1205
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:37,791
One moment.

1206
01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:42,166
Stop knocking, bitch!

1207
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:46,208
Ouch!

1208
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:47,541
Let me help.

1209
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:50,125
How are you? Just be patient, okay?

1210
01:16:51,208 --> 01:16:52,291
Be careful.

1211
01:16:57,875 --> 01:17:00,000
How's your leg? Are you good?

1212
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:03,083
My legs are okay.

1213
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:06,916
I haven't performed for many nights.

1214
01:17:07,291 --> 01:17:09,208
Mama keeps calling me.

1215
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,583
If I don't go this time, I'll be fired.

1216
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:15,458
Parn, someone wants to see you.

1217
01:17:16,375 --> 01:17:17,375
Who?

1218
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:26,333
Come in...

1219
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:34,958
Some fruits.

1220
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:37,750
Thank you, Khan Tok.

1221
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:47,708
What are you doing?

1222
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:49,458
I'm sorry.

1223
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:53,625
If I had been more reasonable,
you wouldn't have got hurt.

1224
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:57,500
It's okay, Khan Tok.
I understand very well.

1225
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:59,125
If I were you,

1226
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:02,125
I would be ashamed to have Noina.

1227
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:03,375
You bitch!

1228
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,750
Oops, sorry again.

1229
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:19,916
Parn, I have an idea.

1230
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,375
So Mama won't fire you.

1231
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:22,916
How?

1232
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:26,166
Don't worry, Dow and I will handle it.

1233
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:29,916
Right, Khan Tok?

1234
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:32,666
Me?

1235
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:53,791
-Bye, Jung.
-You go girl.

1236
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:55,208
So beautiful.

1237
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:42,708
You are talented.

1238
01:20:42,791 --> 01:20:43,875
Yes.

1239
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:45,125
Even better than Parn.

1240
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,291
Not really.

1241
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,125
Interested in working here?

1242
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:49,625
No, I'm not available.

1243
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:50,583
Very well then. Gotta go.

1244
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:51,916
Yes, good luck.

1245
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:53,875
-Khan Tok!
-What?

1246
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:55,000
You are so good.

1247
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:55,958
You're sweet talking, Jung.

1248
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:57,958
You are good at everything.

1249
01:20:58,041 --> 01:20:59,875
Even better than all my dogs.

1250
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:01,125
Bitch!

1251
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:02,833
I'll slap that mouth of yours.

1252
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:04,291
-Khan Tok.
-Yes.

1253
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:07,000
Thank you for replacing me.

1254
01:21:07,083 --> 01:21:10,208
My pleasure. It's Jung's idea.

1255
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:11,916
Thank you, Jung.

1256
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,041
It's okay. Friends help each other.

1257
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:15,416
What's going on?

1258
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:18,750
Parn!

1259
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:20,708
Is it bad?

1260
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:22,541
It's much better, Mama.

1261
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:25,458
Lucky that your friends are here.

1262
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,666
Otherwise, what would we do?

1263
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:31,083
But I have something to tell you.

1264
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:34,000
I found your replacement.

1265
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,416
She has a title with her too.

1266
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:40,583
And she is here now.

1267
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:42,791
Sang-harn.

1268
01:21:56,416 --> 01:22:00,041
Here is your replacement, Sang-harn.

1269
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:06,458
It's okay, Mama.

1270
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,583
If you want to go bankrupt, hire her.

1271
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:12,625
I have to go.

1272
01:22:12,708 --> 01:22:13,833
Man, let's go.

1273
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:16,250
Come on. Yes, let's go.

1274
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:18,125
Parn! Parn!

1275
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:21,416
I was joking, come back.

1276
01:22:22,166 --> 01:22:23,416
Don't be upset.

1277
01:22:24,791 --> 01:22:25,916
Sang-harn.

1278
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,333
Yes, Mama.

1279
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:28,625
I fired you.

1280
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:29,875
What?

1281
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:32,625
But I haven't performed.

1282
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:36,416
With this look, no need.
Go back to your farm.

1283
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:38,458
Go hug your title.

1284
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:42,000
Come on now, just stay.

1285
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:45,708
Good bye, Mama.

1286
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:51,833
When we see the silver linings.

1287
01:22:51,916 --> 01:22:55,583
Thai queers will rise.

1288
01:22:56,666 --> 01:22:58,333
-Sang-harn.
-Yes, Mama?

1289
01:22:58,416 --> 01:22:59,916
Did you steal anything from me?

1290
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:01,708
No.

1291
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:03,916
Very well then. Go, go, go.

1292
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,833
Good luck with farming.

1293
01:23:05,916 --> 01:23:07,041
Amen.

1294
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,625
Sang-harn!

1295
01:23:08,708 --> 01:23:10,166
Yes, Mama?

1296
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,416
Got money for the bus?

1297
01:23:11,916 --> 01:23:12,958
Got money for the bus?

1298
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:14,250
I am richer than you.

1299
01:23:14,708 --> 01:23:16,125
I'll wire the money to you.

1300
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:24,791
My family knows about us.

1301
01:23:26,666 --> 01:23:28,208
They don't want us to see each other.

1302
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:32,625
They want me to marry
the woman they picked.

1303
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:36,791
You are telling me...

1304
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:41,125
We won't see each other again?

1305
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,333
Yes.

1306
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,541
I'm sorry.

1307
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:08,416
I have to go.

1308
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:44,208
Tom.

1309
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:47,000
Why are you crying?

1310
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:52,958
Jet broke up with me.

1311
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:59,208
Tom, don't cry. It's okay.

1312
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:01,208
Come on, don't cry.

1313
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:04,375
Tom.

1314
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:08,041
Men are like gums.

1315
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:11,166
Tasteless at first.

1316
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,458
No.

1317
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:19,833
Juicy at first.

1318
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:21,000
Yes.

1319
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:25,500
But finally, tasteless in the end.

1320
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:29,875
Dow, you can say this.

1321
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:32,416
You haven't experienced it,
you don't understand.

1322
01:25:35,416 --> 01:25:36,958
Don't cry, Tom. It's okay.

1323
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:46,375
Tom.

1324
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,083
Tom, don't be sad.

1325
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:54,958
At least, you have us with you.

1326
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:56,583
Yes.

1327
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,125
Stop crying now.

1328
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:01,541
Don't cry.

1329
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:13,250
Grandma!

1330
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:16,000
-Tom!
-Grandma!

1331
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:17,250
Tom!

1332
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:19,166
How are you?

1333
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,708
I'm good, Grandma.

1334
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:23,875
I miss you everyday.
Is it difficult out there?

1335
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:24,833
No.

1336
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:28,750
How do you eat? Who cooks for you?

1337
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:30,958
Jung takes a good care of me, Grandma.

1338
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:33,958
I miss you everyday.

1339
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:35,500
I miss you too.

1340
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:37,958
Come back home, Son.

1341
01:26:38,041 --> 01:26:41,083
Tom, come home. Grandma.

1342
01:26:56,916 --> 01:26:58,708
Tom, hurry up. You'll be late.

1343
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:00,000
Grandma, hello.

1344
01:27:02,375 --> 01:27:04,083
Hello, Mama.

1345
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:05,458
Hey...

1346
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:08,583
The whole time you have been away.

1347
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:11,791
You've been with these freaks?

1348
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:13,083
Is that right?

1349
01:27:14,333 --> 01:27:15,791
Alright then!

1350
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:19,208
Mama, please!

1351
01:27:19,291 --> 01:27:21,500
Don't hurt us.

1352
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:22,541
Mama, no!

1353
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:24,291
Get out! Get out!

1354
01:27:24,375 --> 01:27:27,625
He came back for you.
Why are you doing this?

1355
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:29,416
Get out!

1356
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:32,750
-Grandma! Grandma!
-Get out!

1357
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:34,750
Let's leave.

1358
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:35,750
Get out!

1359
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:36,708
Tom!

1360
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:41,833
Get out!

1361
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:46,958
Mama...

1362
01:27:48,916 --> 01:27:50,375
We are not freaks!

1363
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,250
Go.

1364
01:27:57,291 --> 01:28:04,291
Jung, you think the man I love come to me?

1365
01:28:05,416 --> 01:28:08,333
I don't think so.

1366
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:11,083
I can see the stupidity on his face!

1367
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:12,666
Jung!

1368
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:18,250
Dow, I have come for you.

1369
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:20,541
Dow, please come out.

1370
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:23,500
Dow, I heard someone calling your name.

1371
01:28:23,583 --> 01:28:26,041
Dow, please come out.

1372
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:32,958
If there are a million stars.

1373
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:39,750
I just hope one would listen to me.

1374
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,833
It's him!

1375
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:46,333
See? The guy I miss

1376
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:49,250
is not stupid like someone around here.

1377
01:28:51,041 --> 01:28:53,125
Dow, you call me stupid?

1378
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:58,625
-Who is it?
-That guy from Chiang Mai team.

1379
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:01,791
Tonight we all see starlight.

1380
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:05,458
As long as the sky is bright.

1381
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:08,000
Enough, I'm here.

1382
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:13,625
Dow.

1383
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:18,333
How did you get here?

1384
01:29:19,458 --> 01:29:22,083
I took a bus to Mo Chit station.

1385
01:29:22,166 --> 01:29:24,833
And take another bus here.

1386
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,750
You have come so far...

1387
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:30,166
I didn't think I would find you.

1388
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:34,916
Now I'm here. Still miss me?

1389
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:40,583
I still miss you, but can I go inside?

1390
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:43,916
Oh, sorry I forgot.

1391
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:48,041
Everybody.

1392
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:57,666
This is Fandee-Fanden.

1393
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:00,708
This is Jung, and Tom.

1394
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:02,458
Hello.

1395
01:30:02,541 --> 01:30:05,416
Oh, that Chinese boy.

1396
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,458
Absurd!

1397
01:30:06,791 --> 01:30:10,166
His name is Piak.

1398
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:13,708
Or call him Fandee-Fanden.

1399
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,750
My head is not bald yet.

1400
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:22,791
So... what are you doing here?

1401
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:26,333
I was looking for my girlfriend.

1402
01:30:27,291 --> 01:30:28,916
Her name is Dow.

1403
01:30:29,375 --> 01:30:31,041
I love her so much. She's hot.

1404
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:34,333
Again?

1405
01:30:34,583 --> 01:30:37,833
Let's go, Tom. Let's sleep somewhere else.

1406
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:41,875
I don’t want to be the third wheel here.

1407
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:44,833
Dow.

1408
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:47,833
Dow, give yourself to me.

1409
01:30:51,916 --> 01:30:53,583
It won't hurt.

1410
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:00,375
Wait, wait.

1411
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:02,250
I'm not ready.

1412
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:03,250
Just a little.

1413
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:08,250
Dow! Dow!

1414
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:12,583
-Wait.
-Dow.

1415
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:18,375
I have never... Will I get pregnant?

1416
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:19,791
No.

1417
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,833
Don't!

1418
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:27,708
Wait.

1419
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:31,958
Don't!

1420
01:31:32,041 --> 01:31:32,958
Dow!

1421
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,166
Ouch.

1422
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:39,458
Dow!

1423
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:41,708
Dow! Dow!

1424
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:44,291
And yet you said you never.

1425
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:48,541
Mama.

1426
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:51,458
Come in, it's not locked.

1427
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:00,458
What's up Noina?

1428
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:10,958
I come to tell you, that everything...

1429
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:13,166
it's my fault.

1430
01:32:16,041 --> 01:32:19,958
If I'm not in the team,
all of this wouldn’t have happened.

1431
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:26,416
And if I didn't let myself
go with Khan Tok

1432
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:30,458
it wouldn't happen.

1433
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,708
What do you want to do?

1434
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:37,083
You were both drunk, weren’t you?

1435
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:38,625
Yes,

1436
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:41,458
I was so wasted.

1437
01:32:43,041 --> 01:32:45,291
And I lost my conscious.

1438
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:48,125
Had no strength to protect myself.

1439
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:49,125
What do you want?

1440
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:51,500
I want to resign.

1441
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:52,625
What?

1442
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:59,000
Mama, do you know...

1443
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,291
my part...

1444
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:06,208
is not ready to play volleyball.

1445
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,000
Think about it.

1446
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:13,625
Khan Tok...

1447
01:33:15,708 --> 01:33:19,458
screwed me hard.

1448
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:24,416
Can you imagine...

1449
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:26,458
Corn,

1450
01:33:28,291 --> 01:33:29,416
durian,

1451
01:33:30,416 --> 01:33:31,750
cheese...

1452
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:34,500
falling down the floor?

1453
01:33:34,583 --> 01:33:35,791
Enough, I'm going to throw up.

1454
01:33:36,458 --> 01:33:37,708
It's up to you.

1455
01:33:58,291 --> 01:33:59,375
I'm not talking to you.

1456
01:34:13,666 --> 01:34:15,333
Mui, I...

1457
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:17,875
Don't tell me,

1458
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,583
You come to resign too.

1459
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:24,541
Yes, I'm the cause of this.

1460
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:27,375
I'm leaving now.

1461
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:42,541
-Mui.
-Mui.

1462
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:45,875
Do you know Khan Tok
and Noina is resigning...

1463
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:47,250
I know.

1464
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:49,666
And what did you say?

1465
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:55,041
What do you think?

1466
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:03,833
Not enough players, we can't play.

1467
01:35:05,041 --> 01:35:06,416
Mui!

1468
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:09,208
Why did you say that?

1469
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:11,333
I thought it through, Nu.

1470
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:15,000
Now go.

1471
01:35:16,583 --> 01:35:17,833
Yes.

1472
01:35:33,375 --> 01:35:34,250
Think about it, Mui.

1473
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:26,583
What are we going to do?

1474
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,458
I think we just have to lay low.

1475
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:40,000
Give Mui some times to think...

1476
01:36:41,375 --> 01:36:43,208
and then go back to her again.

1477
01:36:47,708 --> 01:36:49,875
I really don't get it.

1478
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:53,250
Why she gives up easily?

1479
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:11,125
Chart.

1480
01:37:12,208 --> 01:37:14,500
Why don't you try to talk to Mui?

1481
01:37:14,583 --> 01:37:16,083
She might change her mind.

1482
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:19,375
Nu, she won't.

1483
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:23,041
But Mui listens to you.

1484
01:37:24,708 --> 01:37:29,958
Chart, don't you know Mui loves you?

1485
01:37:33,666 --> 01:37:35,666
I know it for a long time.

1486
01:37:38,208 --> 01:37:39,500
-Yes?
-Yes.

1487
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,416
I have been so stupid!

1488
01:37:51,166 --> 01:37:54,500
I told her that I like her as a friend.

1489
01:37:55,666 --> 01:37:57,041
What?

1490
01:37:57,416 --> 01:37:58,416
Really?

1491
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:02,625
You both deserve each other!

1492
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,208
Piss me off!

1493
01:38:07,083 --> 01:38:08,166
Nu!

1494
01:38:09,791 --> 01:38:11,041
What?

1495
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:13,375
-What?
-Stop.

1496
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:14,666
Nu!

1497
01:38:24,375 --> 01:38:26,208
It... it's leaking.

1498
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:41,208
Put down your money. Fingers crossed.

1499
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:43,875
Mod, you dealt me such bad cards.

1500
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:45,375
Selling a lot, Papa?

1501
01:39:46,666 --> 01:39:48,166
-Mama, did you?
-I did.

1502
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:50,041
You're really lovely.

1503
01:39:59,916 --> 01:40:04,291
Jung. I love you all.

1504
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,625
Take care of the team.

1505
01:40:08,458 --> 01:40:09,958
It's my fault.

1506
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:14,458
The team is broken up because of me.

1507
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:16,291
I'm bad.

1508
01:40:18,083 --> 01:40:19,375
Goodbye.

1509
01:40:19,458 --> 01:40:20,458
Mui!

1510
01:40:20,916 --> 01:40:21,791
Mui!

1511
01:40:21,875 --> 01:40:23,458
Jung, what's wrong with Mui?

1512
01:40:23,541 --> 01:40:26,583
Something happened. He said goodbye.

1513
01:40:27,458 --> 01:40:28,416
Goodbye?

1514
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:29,500
What?

1515
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:36,291
Mui!

1516
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:38,083
Mui! Mui!

1517
01:40:38,166 --> 01:40:40,000
Mui!

1518
01:40:40,083 --> 01:40:42,291
Mui!

1519
01:40:42,375 --> 01:40:43,291
Mui!

1520
01:40:43,375 --> 01:40:45,416
Mui! Mui!

1521
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,708
-Mui! Mui!
-Don't die.

1522
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:50,083
Mui! Mui!

1523
01:40:50,166 --> 01:40:51,625
Mui! Mui!

1524
01:40:52,708 --> 01:40:54,541
-Mui!
-Guys!

1525
01:40:54,625 --> 01:40:57,416
He drank shampoo to commit suicide!

1526
01:40:57,958 --> 01:41:00,083
What?

1527
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:03,541
Mui! Mui!

1528
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:05,500
Mui! Mui!

1529
01:41:05,583 --> 01:41:07,375
I'll give him CPR.

1530
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:10,333
Mui! Mui!

1531
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:12,458
Mui!

1532
01:41:12,541 --> 01:41:15,666
Nu, stop it. You're killing him.

1533
01:41:16,333 --> 01:41:18,375
Mui! Mui!

1534
01:41:18,458 --> 01:41:20,416
Mui!

1535
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,166
What do we do now?

1536
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:23,958
Mui!

1537
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:28,708
Bitch! You can tell me
if you wanna play cards.

1538
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:30,916
Noina! Mui...

1539
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,625
Mui drank shampoo to kill himself.

1540
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:35,666
Huh? Mama killed himself?

1541
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:36,791
Stand back.

1542
01:41:36,875 --> 01:41:39,291
Mama! Mama! Mama!

1543
01:41:39,375 --> 01:41:41,416
Don't just watch.

1544
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:42,583
Anyone gave him a mouth-to-mouth?

1545
01:41:42,666 --> 01:41:44,125
No.

1546
01:41:44,208 --> 01:41:45,125
I'll do it.

1547
01:41:45,208 --> 01:41:46,750
Go on.

1548
01:41:58,833 --> 01:41:59,916
I'm not dead.

1549
01:42:00,333 --> 01:42:02,000
Wow!

1550
01:42:02,083 --> 01:42:04,000
Mui's alive.

1551
01:42:04,083 --> 01:42:05,833
He's alive.

1552
01:42:05,916 --> 01:42:09,041
Thank you for caring about me.

1553
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:10,333
Mui.

1554
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:13,916
Why did you have to kill yourself?

1555
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:16,000
I didn't.

1556
01:42:17,333 --> 01:42:18,583
I just wanna see what you'd do.

1557
01:42:19,625 --> 01:42:20,500
Huh?

1558
01:42:26,541 --> 01:42:27,583
Too expensive.

1559
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:45,375
Thank you for loving one another.

1560
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:47,458
Jung.

1561
01:42:47,666 --> 01:42:48,625

I do.

1564
01:42:55,041 --> 01:42:55,958
What about you?

1565
01:42:58,041 --> 01:42:59,125

1566
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:00,916
Khan Tok.

1567
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,291
Do you love Noina?

1568
01:43:06,291 --> 01:43:07,458
I do.

1569
01:43:07,958 --> 01:43:10,500
Noina, do you love Khan Tok?

1570
01:43:10,958 --> 01:43:12,958
Of course. He's my hubby.

1571
01:43:16,541 --> 01:43:18,500
-Bitch!
-I munched his nose.

1572
01:43:21,375 --> 01:43:22,750
Thank you, once again.

1573
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:26,875
Do you love me?

1574
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:30,291
We do!

1575
01:43:31,916 --> 01:43:35,208
Do you still love playing volleyball?

1576
01:43:35,666 --> 01:43:37,791
The most!

1577
01:43:37,875 --> 01:43:40,000
Very good! So...

Tomorrow, be punctual. Don't be late.

1579
01:43:42,833 --> 01:43:45,000
Don't skip the practice.
Don't dawdle. Got it?

1580
01:43:45,333 --> 01:43:47,458
Why didn't you just call me?
You wasted the shampoo.

1581
01:43:47,541 --> 01:43:49,708
-We're leaving.
-Go.Go.

1582
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:53,000
Take it, you plan master.

1583
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,250
Don't dawdle.

1584
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:03,458
Mui, don't do anything crazy again.

1585
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:05,458
Alright.

1586

1587
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:18,000
I killed two birds with one stone.

1588
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,875
Boy up. Boy down.

Why is he staring at me?

What's the big deal. Move. Go.

1630
01:49:29,875 --> 01:49:31,416
You can stare at me.

1631

01:54:35,916 --> 01:54:36,916
Dow!

1701
01:54:39,041 --> 01:54:40,791
Dow! Get up!

1702
01:54:40,875 --> 01:54:44,500
They can ruin the reputation
of volleyball.

1703
01:54:44,583 --> 01:54:47,583
Remember, to be defeated by queers...

1704
01:54:47,666 --> 01:54:49,375
-Isn't an option.
-Yes, sir.

1705
01:54:49,458 --> 01:54:50,708
Dow, catch! Dow, catch!

1706
01:54:51,708 --> 01:54:52,666
Dow!

1707
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,791
Are you calling for your dad?

1708
01:54:54,875 --> 01:54:56,000
I know that you love me.

1709
01:54:56,833 --> 01:54:58,666
I'm in a game. Sit down! Sit!

1710
01:54:58,916 --> 01:54:59,791
Sit! Sit!

1711
01:55:00,625 --> 01:55:01,541
Sit down.

1712
01:55:04,416 --> 01:55:05,291
-Hey!
-Yes.

1713
01:55:05,375 --> 01:55:06,333
Are you in?

1714
01:55:06,791 --> 01:55:08,500
Suphanburi. Fight!

1715
01:55:22,666 --> 01:55:24,000
LAMPANG 5-10 SUPHANBURI

1716
01:56:03,333 --> 01:56:04,708
Queer!

1717
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:05,666
-Queer!
-Buff!

1718
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:06,791
-Queer!
-Buff!

1719
01:56:06,875 --> 01:56:08,375
Bang-rachan queer!

1720
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:11,125
Are you insulting me?
Are you insulting me?

1721
01:56:12,541 --> 01:56:14,083
Are you insulting me?

1722
01:56:14,166 --> 01:56:15,916
-Are you insulting me?
-Calm down!

1723
01:56:18,250 --> 01:56:20,041
Fight, Noina.

1724
01:56:22,166 --> 01:56:23,875
Noina. Fight.

1725
01:56:28,791 --> 01:56:30,500
Noina!

1726
01:56:30,583 --> 01:56:32,125
Noina.

1727
01:56:32,208 --> 01:56:33,208
Noina!

1728
01:56:33,666 --> 01:56:34,916
Come here!

1729
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,083
Noina!

1730
01:56:38,375 --> 01:56:39,708
LAMPANG 4-6 SUPHANBURI

1731
01:57:00,416 --> 01:57:02,666
LAMPANG 12-13 SUPHANBURI

1732
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:03,708
Come here!

1733
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:06,875
Everyone, listen to me.

1734
01:57:06,958 --> 01:57:08,666
I know that you're all tired.

1735
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:10,500
But we have to put a good fight.

1736
01:57:10,958 --> 01:57:12,958
Because we've come so far.

1737
01:57:14,875 --> 01:57:16,208
LAMPANG 13-13 SUPHANBURI

1738
01:57:17,708 --> 01:57:21,000
Although we aren't strong like them,

1739
01:57:21,416 --> 01:57:22,416
But I believe...

1740
01:57:23,708 --> 01:57:26,541
Our spirits can beat them.

1741
01:57:27,208 --> 01:57:28,166
Ready.

1742
01:57:28,916 --> 01:57:30,083
All the way. Iron...

1743
01:57:30,833 --> 01:57:32,708
Iron Ladies!

1744
01:58:41,208 --> 01:58:44,166
The winner of today is region five.

1745
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:47,166
From Lampang. Iron Ladies!

1746
01:59:19,375 --> 01:59:22,250
After we won the Paknam Po Games,

1747
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:24,916
We're famous.

1748
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:28,916
We're featured in interviews
and television programs.

1749
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,833
Our story was made into movie.

1750
01:59:31,958 --> 01:59:34,791
After the dream was accomplished,

1751
01:59:35,166 --> 01:59:38,500
We returned to our normal lives.

1752
01:59:39,125 --> 01:59:42,041
But we still dream that one day

1753
01:59:42,666 --> 01:59:45,333
We'll reunite as a team.

1754
02:01:41,458 --> 02:01:42,458
It's good stuff, Mui.

1755
02:01:42,541 --> 02:01:45,041
You bitch! You're even better than me.

1756
02:01:55,541 --> 02:01:57,500
Turn on the fan!

1757
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:08,333
-Dao.
-No!

1758
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:11,916
Don't be too rough.

1759
02:02:18,916 --> 02:02:20,458
I told you not to be aggressive.

1760
02:02:23,791 --> 02:02:25,458
-Hey!
-What was that?

1761
02:02:41,875 --> 02:02:43,833
Shit. Who smacked my balls?

1762
02:02:45,916 --> 02:02:49,708
I take all the blame.
I can't take care of my team.

1763
02:02:49,791 --> 02:02:51,250
I love you all.

1764
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:57,583
My whole world is for you, Chart.

1765
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:03,333
Oh, I shouldn't make it funny?

1766
02:03:03,458 --> 02:03:05,750
Tom, can I have a shot?

1767
02:03:05,833 --> 02:03:07,416
Your jaw is so undefined. Come on.

1768
02:03:10,416 --> 02:03:14,000
-Jung, Parn, she's so snatched!
-Damn, she's on point.

1769
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:17,416
I want Angelina Jolie's lips.

1770
02:03:55,083 --> 02:03:57,625
Please give it up for the Iron Ladies!

1771
02:04:12,625 --> 02:04:13,875
Make way!

1772
02:04:34,458 --> 02:04:36,958
Madame Jang, allow me to touch you.

1773
02:04:37,291 --> 02:04:38,458
This is my junk!

1774
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:43,625
I want you to see my dick...
Wait, that wasn't in the script!

1775
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,250
They're so awesome.

1776
02:04:55,958 --> 02:04:57,250
They play so well.
