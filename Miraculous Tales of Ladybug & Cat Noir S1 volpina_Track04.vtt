&lrm;The sample garment doesn't match.

&lrm;All you had to do
&lrm;was follow a pattern, imbeciles.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.220
&lrm;What am I supposed to do?
&lrm;The show is in 3 days.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.460
&lrm;No, he's completely useless.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.540
&lrm;Call my assistant, Nathalie.
&lrm;She'll give you some other names.

&lrm;He hides stuff

&lrm;[Plagg]
&lrm;I love dirty secrets.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.180
&lrm;[Plagg excitedly]
&lrm;Yes, go, go on.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.500
&lrm;I can't.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.220
&lrm;My dad will be angry.

&lrm;I don't know the code,

&lrm;[Plagg]
&lrm;You party-pooper.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.220
&lrm;Plagg, no!

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.020
&lrm;[Plagg]
&lrm;My my, what have we got here?

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.100
&lrm;A book on Tibet, a hotel flyer,
&lrm;a load of old junk.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.180
&lrm;Come on! Where's the good stuff?

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.180
&lrm;[Plagg]
&lrm;I've seen this book before.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060
&lrm;But who cares? I'm famished.
&lrm;I need camembert!

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.380
&lrm;Why does my dad keep
&lrm;this in a safe?

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.980
&lrm;[gasping] Hawk Moth?

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.580
&lrm;Why is a monster
&lrm;in a book of superheroes?

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.460
&lrm;[Plagg] Cheese! Didn't you hear me?

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.900

&lrm;[gasping]

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.820
&lrm;[approaching footsteps]

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.980
&lrm;Adrien, you're going to be late.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.300
&lrm;I was looking for my homework.
&lrm;Silly me.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.700
&lrm;[Rose] Can you believe it?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.340
&lrm;Lila knows Prince Ali?

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.420
&lrm;She even flew in his private jet.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.380
&lrm;Why did Jagged Stone write a song
&lrm;about Lila and not me?

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.620
&lrm;Lila knows all
&lrm;the Hollywood directors.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.140
&lrm;She said she'd mention me
&lrm;to Mr Besielberg.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.420
&lrm;-Lila?
&lrm;-Yeah,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.900
&lrm;she just started here.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.500
&lrm;She gave me an interview.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.940
&lrm;Ladybug saved her life once.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.020
&lrm;Who is this girl?

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.060
&lrm;What's she doing next to my love?

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.300
&lrm;Lila's got the most incredible life.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.300
&lrm;And now she's going here.
&lrm;She's totally awesome.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.820
&lrm;What? Don't say that.
&lrm;This is super-bad.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.700
&lrm;What if he falls for her?

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.580
&lrm;I've never flown in a jet.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.180
&lrm;Nobody's written a song about me
&lrm;and I don't know anyone in Hollywood.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.700
&lrm;He'll forget I exist!

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.420
&lrm;Where are they going?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.260
&lrm;Alya, we've gotta stop them.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.780
&lrm;You need to chill out.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.180
&lrm;My Ladyblog had the most hits ever
&lrm;after that interview.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.420
&lrm;What's going on?

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.860
&lrm;Has this girl hypnotized everyone?

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.500
&lrm;Are you jealous, Marinette?

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.420
&lrm;Me? Jealous?

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.820
&lrm;No way.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.220
&lrm;Where is she?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.260
&lrm;Marinette, Adrien's book!
&lrm;I need a closer look.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.140
&lrm;Why are you
&lrm;so concerned about his book? Hide!

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.900
&lrm;Now we can do our homework.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.980
&lrm;It's more fun doing it together.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.620
&lrm;[gasping] What's that?

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.380
&lrm;Nothing, just stories about...
&lrm;superheroes.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.820
&lrm;[seductively] I love superheroes.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.780
&lrm;No, it's already too late!

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.420
&lrm;[questioning sighs]

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.780
&lrm;Ladybug?

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.260
&lrm;[Adrien sighs]

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.340
&lrm;She's amazing.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.420
&lrm;A girl doesn't need to wear
&lrm;a costume to be amazing, you know?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.820
&lrm;I don't know...

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.540
&lrm;So, you've got
&lrm;a soft spot for the bug?

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.660
&lrm;Me?

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.580
&lrm;No, not at all.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.740
&lrm;You know,
&lrm;I happen to be friends with Ladybug.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.820
&lrm;Really?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.940
&lrm;We can chat about it but not here.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.620
&lrm;Let's meet in the park after school.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.860
&lrm;[growling]

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.180

&lrm;[phone vibrates]

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.100
&lrm;I gotta go.
&lrm;I've got a lesson in 58 seconds.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.780
&lrm;So... the park?

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.900
&lrm;Sure.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.380
&lrm;A vixen superheroin...?

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.060
&lrm;Interesting.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.780
&lrm;[Tikki gasps] Marinette.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.220
&lrm;I know. I've gotta talk to Adrien
&lrm;before he meets Lila.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.140
&lrm;He has to know she's a thief.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.540
&lrm;No. You can't say anything.
&lrm;I need to check out the book first.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.980
&lrm;If it's what I think, we have to get it.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.460
&lrm;I don't get it.
&lrm;Why do we need it?

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.500
&lrm;I'll explain when I'm sure.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.020
&lrm;We mustn't let Lila out of our sight.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.100
<i>&lrm;Ladybug and me? We're like this.</i>

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.700
&lrm;Liar.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.020
&lrm;[Tikki] There. She's coming out.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.180
&lrm;[Tikki sighs] We're too far away.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.900
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.140
&lrm;Hi.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.300
&lrm;Oh no! He's already here.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.180
&lrm;She dumped the book in the bin.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.460
&lrm;What a brat.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.100
&lrm;-I'll get it.
&lrm;-No.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.220
&lrm;I have to get it.
&lrm;You take care of Adrien.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.260
&lrm;Tikki...

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.580
&lrm;[Adrien]
&lrm;So you do know Ladybug, for real?

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.500
&lrm;This is the book, Marinette.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.700
&lrm;Not only did Ladybug save my life,
&lrm;we've become close friends.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.860
&lrm;We've something special in common.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.500
&lrm;It's what I wanted to tell you about.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.860
&lrm;I'm the descendant

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.340
&lrm;of a vixen superheroine, Volpina.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.620
&lrm;Volpina?

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.460
&lrm;Volpina?

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.420
&lrm;I read about her in my book.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.460
&lrm;Of course she's in it.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.300
&lrm;She's one
&lrm;of the most important superheroes,

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.860
&lrm;and more powerful than Ladybug.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.940
&lrm;Ladybug doesn't even make the top 10.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.500
&lrm;My grandma gave me this necklace.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.140
&lrm;[Tikki] She's good, really good.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.940
&lrm;You've got your book.
&lrm;I can't lose Adrien.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.220
&lrm;Time to transform!

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.660
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.700
&lrm;Are you telling me

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.420
&lrm;this is a... Miraculous?

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.180
&lrm;Hey, Lila. How's it going?
&lrm;Long time no see.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.060
&lrm;I saw your interview.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.420
&lrm;Awesome job.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.140
&lrm;Sure, I remember when I saved your life

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.420
&lrm;We've been good friends
&lrm;ever since, practically BFFs.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.780
&lrm;Actually, when did I save your life?
&lrm;I don't recall.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.860
&lrm;Yes, of course, now I remember...
&lrm;Never!

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.060
&lrm;And we're not friends either.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.420
&lrm;Miss Show-off was trying
&lrm;to impress you and everyone else.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.660
&lrm;[sobbing]

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.020
&lrm;So you're not a descendant
&lrm;of a superhero?

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.780
&lrm;More like a super-liar.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.900
&lrm;How dare you!

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.140
&lrm;Wait... Lila...

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.100
&lrm;What was that all about?

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.340
&lrm;I mean... weren't you a bit harsh?

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.020
&lrm;I don't put up with lies
&lrm;especially when they're about me.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.940
&lrm;What is with you, Ladybug?

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.620
&lrm;I may have gone overboard,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.340
&lrm;but at least I'm not dealing
&lrm;with her anymore.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.780
&lrm;My chances with Adrien... Gone!

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.620
&lrm;I hate you, Ladybug.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.740
&lrm;[she growls]

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.460
&lrm;Jealousy, deceit,
&lrm;and the desire to be a superhero.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.900
&lrm;This young lady is my perfect prey.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.060
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.620
&lrm;Fly, my evil little one,
&lrm;and akumatise her!

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.220
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.540
&lrm;Volpina... I am Hawk Moth!

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.980
&lrm;I'm giving you the power of illusion.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.420
&lrm;From now on your lies will come to life.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.660
&lrm;Gain Ladybug and Cat Noir's trust

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.900
&lrm;and convince them you're a superhero.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.780
&lrm;Then, betray them
&lrm;and bring me their Miraculous!

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.980
&lrm;It would be my pleasure, Hawk Moth.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.020
&lrm;[bubbling]

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.900
&lrm;[gasping]

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.180
&lrm;[gasping]

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.140
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.780
&lrm;Code red!

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.860
&lrm;[Ladybug gasps]

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.900
&lrm;[struggling]

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.740
&lrm;[she yells]

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.180
&lrm;[squawking]

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.820
&lrm;[cooing]

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.500
&lrm;I am Volpina,
&lrm;the only superhero Paris needs.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.460
&lrm;[cheering] Volpina, Volpina!

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.420
&lrm;[chanting] Volpina, Volpina!

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.580
&lrm;Volpina?

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.300
&lrm;-We've got a new partner.
&lrm;-Isn't it weird?

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.380
&lrm;A superhero appearing out of nowhere?

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.300
&lrm;[Cat Noir] At least she got the job done.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.340
&lrm;I could have stopped the meteorite.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.860
&lrm;Hey, relax.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.340
&lrm;I'm just saying she seems awesome.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.780
&lrm;Hey, glad you dropped in.
&lrm;I need a hand. Come on.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.020
&lrm;[gasping]

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.100
&lrm;[Cat Noir] I can't believe it,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.100
&lrm;it's Hawk Moth, in the flesh.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.260
&lrm;He never shows up.
&lrm;Something big is going on.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.980
&lrm;We can take him down
&lrm;but it'll take all of us.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.260
&lrm;We better make the most of our talents.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.500
&lrm;Count on us.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.900
&lrm;Very nice to meet you, Cat Noir.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.180
&lrm;Cool outfit.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.820
&lrm;Why thanks. You too.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.380
&lrm;[gagging]

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.940
&lrm;First the meteorite,
&lrm;now Hawk Moth appearing,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.460
&lrm;on the same day?
&lrm;Isn't that unusual?

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.380
&lrm;Why would you say that?

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.060
&lrm;I was asking Cat Noir.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.060
&lrm;I'm finding you unusual today,
&lrm;everything OK?

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.580
&lrm;I'm fine, just fine.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.780
&lrm;Volpina, what's your Miraculous?

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.260
&lrm;My necklace.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.140
&lrm;-What power does it give you?
&lrm;-Flight and super-strength.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.300
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.740
&lrm;He's getting away!

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.500
&lrm;Ladybug, go left. Cat Noir, go right.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.380
&lrm;I'll come from... behind.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.940
&lrm;No! I'll go right,
&lrm;Cat Noir from behind,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.620
&lrm;and you... go left.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:33.980
&lrm;Fine.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.660
&lrm;-No difference to me.
&lrm;-Good.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.820
&lrm;[Volpina roars]

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.300
&lrm;Can you chill out?
&lrm;She's one of us.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.380
&lrm;[she sighs]

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.380
&lrm;He's running right into my trap.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.660
&lrm;Where did he go?

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.660
&lrm;I'll take him.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.140
&lrm;Good, now that other one.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.020
&lrm;Where did he go?

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.420
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.060
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.100
&lrm;I wouldn't move an inch if I were you.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.180
&lrm;Don't worry,
&lrm;I don't want to be your friend.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.260
&lrm;But now we won't be able to say
&lrm;you don't know me.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.420
&lrm;Lila?

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.540
&lrm;You'll call me Volpina!

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.460
&lrm;You're not a superhero.
&lrm;You're one of Hawk Moth's victims.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.580
&lrm;Everyone thinks I'm a superhero,
&lrm;including Cat Noir.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.420
&lrm;So you won't be able
&lrm;to call me a liar anymore,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.940
&lrm;because everyone will think
&lrm;you're the liar.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.620
&lrm;Volpina, take Ladybug's Miraculous,
&lrm;her earring. Now!

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.020
&lrm;Before I get rid of you,

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.860
&lrm;you're going to give me
&lrm;your Miraculous.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.020
&lrm;Never!

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.380
&lrm;Do you really think
&lrm;you've got a choice, Ladybug?

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.420
&lrm;Either you give me the Miraculous
&lrm;or the building goes down!

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.380
&lrm;You wouldn't.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.780
&lrm;[screaming]

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.260
&lrm;[screaming]

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.540
&lrm;Stop!

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.460
&lrm;[rumbling]

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.700
&lrm;It's an illusion,
&lrm;like the meteorite, like Hawk Moth.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.620
&lrm;That's your power, isn't it?

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.700
&lrm;[Ladybug] Illusion, lies,

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.060
&lrm;Of course.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.660
&lrm;[popping]

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.900
&lrm;[she roars]

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.180
&lrm;[whizzing]

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.620
&lrm;Of course.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.460
&lrm;Is Volpina with you?

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.620
<i>&lrm;No, I can't find Hawk Moth either.</i>

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.580
&lrm;He was never there.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.340
<i>&lrm;What? But we saw him?</i>

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.060
<i>&lrm;That's Volpina's power.</i>

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.780
<i>&lrm;She creates illusions.</i>
<i>&lrm;Hawk Moth wasn't real.</i>

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.540
&lrm;What are you saying?

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.140
<i>&lrm;She's not a superhero.</i>
<i>&lrm;She was akumatised by Hawk Moth.</i>

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.500
&lrm;-I don't get it. Why?
&lrm;-<i>&lrm;I think it's my fault.</i>

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.060
<i>&lrm;I ruined her chances</i>
<i>&lrm;with a guy she likes.</i>

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.300
&lrm;Lila?

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.100
<i>&lrm;She's going to his house.</i>

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.060
<i>&lrm;I'll send the address, meet me there.</i>

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.260
&lrm;You got it.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.620
&lrm;I think I know the way.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.460
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.180
&lrm;Wouldn't Cat Noir be more useful?

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.380
&lrm;If Volpina's got a thing for me,
&lrm;I can make her see sense.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.380
&lrm;You think you can take down Volpina...
&lrm;without me?

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.180
&lrm;Hide, Plagg. She's coming.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.300
&lrm;Adrien,

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.260
&lrm;Hey. Who are you?

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.460
&lrm;You remember this necklace?

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.540
&lrm;I didn't know how to tell you

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.980
&lrm;but this way you can see I'm not lying,

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.580
&lrm;I am a superhero.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.180
&lrm;-Lila?
&lrm;-You can call me Volpina.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.340
&lrm;I'm sorry about the park earlier.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.420
&lrm;Ladybug's jealous
&lrm;because she's not as powerful as me.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.220
&lrm;You'll see Ladybug isn't just
&lrm;a figment of your imagination.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.260
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.620
&lrm;What is he doing?

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.220
&lrm;No time to hang around.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.540
&lrm;See what I mean?

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.900
&lrm;She's jealous of me... of you, of us.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.020
&lrm;But this time
&lrm;you won't ruin our date, Ladybug.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.420
&lrm;Excuse me but it wasn't really a date...

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.860
&lrm;I mean, it could've become one, right?

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.500
&lrm;[Cat Noir] No need to get angry.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.660
&lrm;Excuse us,
&lrm;I need a chat with Super-liar.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.420
&lrm;You! Stop thinking
&lrm;your illusions are reality.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.740
&lrm;[Plagg] So, was I right, or was I right?

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.380
&lrm;Come on. Claws out!

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.140
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Sorry.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.460
&lrm;I had trouble finding the place.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.020
&lrm;Illusions?

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.460
&lrm;Cat Noir, she's taken Adrien!

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.900
&lrm;-It's an illusion.
&lrm;-How are you so sure?

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.500
&lrm;My feline sixth sense. It's legendary.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.500
&lrm;Really? You don't say. Adrien's gone!

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.220
&lrm;I'm not gonna try to get outta this.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.460
&lrm;[she cackles]

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.900
&lrm;[panting]

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.940
&lrm;Give me your Miraculous now,
&lrm;or I will.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.260
&lrm;I thought you loved him.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.980
&lrm;Not as much as seeing you two defeated.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.340
&lrm;No hard feelings.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.340
&lrm;It's a bluff. It's an illusion.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.020
&lrm;You wanna bet on that?

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.220
&lrm;[humming]

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.780
&lrm;No!

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.900
&lrm;Don't do it, Ladybug.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.580
&lrm;No!

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.580
&lrm;[she growls]

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.100
&lrm;There she is!

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.940
&lrm;[they gasp]

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.140
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.940
&lrm;[gasping]

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.500
&lrm;I've got an idea to take down Volpina.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.980
&lrm;-With a chocolate ice-lolly?
&lrm;-Trust me.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.020
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.380
&lrm;[he yells]

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.060
&lrm;[crumbling]

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.100
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.420
&lrm;[Ladybug] Trapped, like a fox.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.780
&lrm;[she groans]

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.140
&lrm;Your days are over, Akuma.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.540
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.020
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.780
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.780
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.620
&lrm;-Lila?
&lrm;-Ladybug?

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.980
&lrm;I totally overreacted

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.780
&lrm;and never should have spoken
&lrm;to you like that. I'm sorry.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.020
&lrm;Forget it, Ladybug, you were right,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.620
&lrm;we'll never be friends.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.060
&lrm;[Cat Noir] That hurts.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.180
&lrm;She's still angry...

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.380
&lrm;You're not done with Volpina yet, Ladybug.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.180
&lrm;You haven't seen the last of her!

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.580
&lrm;There's one problem
&lrm;Where's Adrien?

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.220
&lrm;Everything's back to normal,
&lrm;so he must be back at home.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.780
&lrm;I should check.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.980
&lrm;No! I'll go.
&lrm;You're about to change back.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.420
&lrm;[bleeping] So are you.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.300
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;No arguing. I'll take care of it.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.620
&lrm;[he sighs] That stubbornness.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.460
&lrm;It's so... so...

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.340
&lrm;irresistible.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:20.980
&lrm;[he gasps]

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.260
&lrm;Adrien?

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.060
&lrm;Are you there?

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.540
&lrm;Can I come in?

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.940
&lrm;This is Ladybug.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.460
&lrm;Is everything OK?

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.220
&lrm;Yeah. Needed a shower

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.700
&lrm;-after all the excitement.
&lrm;-OK...

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.300
&lrm;Sure.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.940
&lrm;-Sorry, I'll be off then.
&lrm;-Thank you.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.180
&lrm;[they sigh]

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.780
&lrm;[he sighs]

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.820
&lrm;This book could have been
&lrm;my connection to Adrien

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.900
&lrm;without my mask for once.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.580
&lrm;But I get it,
&lrm;I'm not gonna be returning it.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.820
&lrm;I'm sorry, Marinette,
&lrm;but its information is invaluable.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.060
&lrm;Information? But it's all in code.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.900
&lrm;Someone's been looking
&lrm;for it for a long time.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.780
&lrm;He knows how to decipher it.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.700
&lrm;What's so special about this book?

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.460
&lrm;It contains all the secrets
&lrm;of the Miraculous powers.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.060
&lrm;It's dangerous in the wrong hands.
&lrm;He needs it back.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.140
&lrm;I don't get it, Tikki.
&lrm;Tell me what's going on. Who is he?

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.860
&lrm;The Great Guardian.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.180
&lrm;I think the time has come
&lrm;for you to meet him.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.060
&lrm;Did you take my book?

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.940
&lrm;[chewing] Of course not.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.060
&lrm;If he finds out

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.580
&lrm;it'll be worse than dealing
&lrm;with Hawk Moth.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.860
&lrm;Hello, Ladybug.
