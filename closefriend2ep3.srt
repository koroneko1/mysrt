1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,000
Where are you going?

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,000
I'll sleep at a friend's.

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:10,279
Thank you for letting me carpool with you.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,560
It's okay.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,560
What's up with work?

6
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:20,449
Once they found out that Pierce and I are together,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
our boss had me under scrutiny right away

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,718
even though I haven't even done anything.

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,440
Let's drink to our secrets.

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,519
Secrets never die.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,160
The expression is "there are no secrets in this world."

12
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:31,920
Oh, okay.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,000
We're going to drink and forget everything.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,320
(Close Friend 2)

15
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,479
("You can be jealous if you want.")

16
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,480
I can't sleep.

17
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,480
I can just drink the water here, right?

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,159
Of course.

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,159
Hey, what's wrong, Phoon?

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,399
You look like you just saw a ghost.

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,319
It's... It's...

22
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,240
Hi.

23
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,560
How come you're back? I thought you said you were staying at the condo.

24
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,039
I've changed my mind.

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,919
I'd rather come home and cuddle with you.

26
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,000
- What are you doing? - Am I dreaming?

27
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,089
Hey, you're not! Silly!

28
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,639
You're seeing what I'm seeing, right?

29
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,439
You're being silly.

30
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,199
Ray?

31
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,520
What is this?

32
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,639
Why did you have to be that close to each other?

33
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,919
Here.

34
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,319
Listen, Ray.

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,520
There's nothing between me and Milin except work.

36
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,599
We're just helping each other promote the new single.

37
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,520
The company's hoping she becomes an artist.

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,639
So they asked me to give them a hand.

39
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,719
And is the ship pairing even necessary?

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,919
Well, it's just an act.

41
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,719
If there's a ship pairing, the fans will pay us more attention,

42
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,759
and people will get to know Milin faster too.

43
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,520
Does the company think Jedi Army will accept this?

44
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,039
I'm not sure.

45
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,800
But I believe

46
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,639
that long-time members of Jedi Army

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,159
will understand

48
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,479
and be welcoming of Milin.

49
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,360
But you don't have to understand.

50
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,879
You can be jealous if you want.

51
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,560
Oh? Why?

52
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,879
I know I can't stop you from feeling that way.

53
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,319
Jealousy is normal for people who are in love.

54
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,920
But I want to prove to you

55
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,730
that there's nothing going on.

56
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,399
You're the only person I love.

57
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,360
Do you know

58
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,959
that us meeting each other

59
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,639
is a miracle?

60
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,680
It's you.

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,639
I'm just a regular guy.

62
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,360
Everyone in the country knows you.

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,730
Actually, no. The whole world does.

64
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,559
Do you know

65
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,800
that if someone told me I'd get to be with you three months ago,

66
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,680
people would call them crazy.

67
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,120
Do you believe me now?

68
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,800
No.

69
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,959
- Do you believe me now? - No.

70
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,319
- You're not going to believe me? - No.

71
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,919
You're not going to believe me? No? No?

72
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,638
- Come here! - Jedi!

73
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,838
You're not going to believe me? Do you believe me now?

74
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,879
- Do you believe me now? - Enough! No!

75
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,399
You're back.

76
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,399
It's still early.

77
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,759
Why didn't you come home a little bit later?

78
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,639
I couldn't fall asleep after I sobered up.

79
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,920
So I thought I should just head home.

80
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,000
I told you you didn't have to go.

81
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,839
What a naughty kid.

82
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,279
Pierce, do the monks come for alms? I want to make an offering.

83
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,360
Oh, I think so. I'll go out and take a look.

84
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,560
- Oh, Typhoon? You're up. - Good morning.

85
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,360
Good. Help me prepare the alms.

86
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay?

87
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,519
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,600
The song mainly tells

89
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,399
the story of a couple.

90
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,480
The woman

91
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,120
is an introvert

92
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,680
suffering from depression.

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,839
The man is an extrovert.

94
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,210
He has a big mouth and a snarky attitude.

95
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,679
But he tries to help with her depression.

96
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,159
The genre of the song

97
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,518
will be easy listening

98
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,480
with a slight hint of jazz.

99
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,720
It's in the same style as Marc's.

100
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,480
What do you think, Milin? Do you like it?

101
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,240
It sounds all right. But I don't want to be depressed.

102
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,799
But I'm okay if it's cute and endearing.

103
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,000
- Pierce, handle it for her. - Okay.

104
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,090
But...

105
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm not sure about the easy listening part.

106
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,559
I think it's boring.

107
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,639
Let's do a mix between pop and R&B.

108
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,519
Can you add a bit of rap

109
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,330
for Jedi to show off his skills?

110
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,720
Well... pop and R&B?

111
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,210
Is that going to work?

112
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,039
Pierce's strength doesn't lie in those genres at all.

113
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,399
Are you saying he's not talented, Tina?

114
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,519
Oh, no.

115
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,519
I can do it.

116
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,360
Good.

117
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,879
Let's give it a listen.

118
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,879
But personally,

119
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,720
I don't really enjoy being a big-mouth and snarky guy.

120
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:01,000
But if that guy, the guy in the lyrics,

121
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,799
really believes so

122
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,559
and says things without lying, then I'm...

123
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,120
He never lies.

124
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,639
Then I'm okay with that.

125
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
What about you, Typhoon?

126
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,799
Do you have any creative references to show me?

127
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,450
Oh? The thing I told you to find yesterday.

128
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,330
Uh...

129
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,039
- I... - I've got a rough draft.

130
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,360
Go on. Play the slideshow.

131
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,120
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,159
It's so exciting. I want to hear the demo soon.

133
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,039
It's okay. I'll do it.

134
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,120
You can sit down.

135
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,399
Phoon,

136
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,679
do you know what a creative team's job entails?

137
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,639
It's not coming to work dressed in chic clothing,

138
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,120
jotting down silly notes.

139
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,039
I understand.

140
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,600
I know you asked me to find references.

141
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,720
But I didn't think we were going to need them today.

142
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,879
I've actually found some.

143
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,519
I just haven't created a presentation yet.

144
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,000
You're lucky Fah had your back today.

145
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,279
I'll let this go because it's the first time.

146
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,600
Don't repeat the same mistake.

147
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,759
Let this be a lesson for you.

148
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,279
And you have to learn to help yourself from now on.

149
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,559
You can't just wait for someone to save the day.

150
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,080
I can't help you either.

151
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,960
And if you want to learn something, check out our previous projects.

152
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,759
Okay.

153
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,399
I promise to do better.

154
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,440
Here you go. Take a look at some of our previous projects.

155
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,360
Thank you so much, ma'am.

156
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,878
Hey, no need to call me that. Just call me Fah.

157
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,000
We're of the same age after all.

158
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:53,519
I only started working here three months before you.

159
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,399
- Really? - Mm.

160
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,519
But you seem to really know your way around here.

161
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,759
How do you do it?

162
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,639
I just do what I'm telling you to do.

163
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,559
Initially, I actually had it worse than you do right now.

164
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,240
I cried so many times.

165
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,840
I almost quit.

166
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,480
Was the workload really that bad?

167
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,600
The workload wasn't the problem.

168
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,919
But you have to be...

169
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,559
mentally tough.

170
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,200
You have to be able to

171
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,639
accept criticism.

172
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,440
And you have to fix your mistakes.

173
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,799
Tina might seem to have that attitude,

174
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,720
but she's actually a very skilled promoter.

175
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,279
I want to be as good as she is.

176
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,360
What about you?

177
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,519
Did you decide to work here

178
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,480
because you want to become a promoter in the future?

179
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,960
A promoter?

180
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,440
I don't know if I'd like it or not.

181
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,240
Pierce's music?

182
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,039
A promoter?

183
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,639
I'm so bored!

184
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:52,600
You have to make her famous, Pierce!

185
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,200
I'll try.

186
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,840
Thank you.

187
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,639
And these are the song lyrics.

188
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,479
Please tell her to memorize it.

189
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,319
Sure. I'll tell her to practice a lot.

190
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,410
Oh, Jedi?

191
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,799
Can you keep Milin company?

192
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,000
Hey, Jedi.

193
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,960
How have you been doing lately?

194
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,000
We need moments like this to fuel the ship pairing.

195
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,959
So that she'll be trending

196
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,480
when we release the music video.

197
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,410
Anyway, please help her practice.

198
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,359
This is very important.

199
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,960
Of course.

200
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,410
Smile.

201
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
It sounds all right.

202
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay. Let's take a break.

203
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,480
Jedi,

204
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,890
do you have to be anywhere after this?

205
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,650
Not really.

206
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,519
Would you like to have dinner together?

207
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,169
Um, well...

208
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,119
I've been working hard recently.

209
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,170
So I just want to head straight home.

210
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,799
Really?

211
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,759
What a shame.

212
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,079
There are so many things I want your advice on.

213
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,119
Okay, guys.

214
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,278
Can I get some photos of you together?

215
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,170
Jedi, scoot closer to Milin.

216
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,410
Sure.

217
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,799
Okay.

218
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:01,839
Uh, Jedi? Scoot a little closer to her.

219
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,240
Closer. A lot closer.

220
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,920
That's good. Can you look into her eyes, Jedi?

221
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Jedi.

222
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,920
Can I talk to you for a bit?

223
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Sure.

224
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Should I come out and talk too?

225
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
You don't have to.

226
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,599
I just want to talk to Jedi.

227
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:55,279
Milin, let's take some photos.

228
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,839
Yes, alone. That's totally fine.

229
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Thank you.

230
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,960
What's the matter? Why did you want to talk to me?

231
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,359
You seem tired.

232
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,650
Very, in fact.

233
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,650
High notes are usually

234
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,680
a piece of cake for you.

235
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,599
Well,

236
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,890
I probably haven't been getting enough sleep.

237
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,599
That's why I'm a little off.

238
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,559
Get some rest, okay?

239
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,079
You need it even more

240
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,799
during the recording process.

241
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,000
You're in front of a camera nearly all the time.

242
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,079
That must be exhausting.

243
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,799
What do you think

244
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,759
about this project?

245
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,720
Do you think it's going to be successful?

246
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,799
I can't force fame.

247
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,240
But when it comes to making good music,

248
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,680
it's already a success

249
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,000
if everyone on the team is on the same page.

250
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,440
But anyway,

251
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,039
I'm going to give this song my all.

252
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,039
Because my boyfriend is a fan of yours.

253
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,720
What is it called, again?

254
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:37,480
Jedi Army, right?

255
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,170
Yes.

256
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:40,920
That is

257
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,319
the most important thing.

258
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,799
Oh, Marc?

259
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,640
Hey, how are you doing?

260
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,119
Marc?

261
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,319
Whoa.

262
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,920
That's Marc.

263
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
He's the artist I'm taking care of.

264
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,799
Excellent.

265
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,680
What's the matter? You're so quiet.

266
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,319
Are you tired?

267
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,559
During the meeting today,

268
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,519
was I really that bad?

269
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,680
No.

270
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,559
It's your first time. How were you supposed to know?

271
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,000
Tina didn't brief you on the details either.

272
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,079
But I should've known how to do my job.

273
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,079
Now that you know,

274
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,319
don't make a mistake next time.

275
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,720
Just keep giving me advice.

276
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
I can't do that.

277
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,440
Our line of work is different.

278
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,680
Oh? But we're on the same team.

279
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,279
We should be able to help each other, right?

280
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll help you, of course.

281
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,480
But our duties and responsibilities

282
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,160
are different.

283
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,519
If you really need advice,

284
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:45,440
I think you should ask Tina,

285
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,480
not me.

286
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,200
Pierce, Typhoon, have a seat.

287
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,720
You guys are still here?

288
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,200
I want to have a word with you.

289
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,319
Are you upset that we're still here?

290
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,359
No, not at all.

291
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Come on, honey.

292
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,200
We're going home tonight.

293
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,079
Mom, don't be like that.

294
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,079
I just want you to tell me in advance that you're coming.

295
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,319
So I can plan things

296
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,240
for when you're here.

297
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,960
Well, you haven't come to visit us.

298
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,240
If I didn't come all the way here,

299
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,799
would I get to see you?

300
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,880
I want to know

301
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,920
how you're doing

302
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,680
and if there's anyone looking after you.

303
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:44,759
I'm sorry.

304
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,599
Anyway, now that we've mentioned it...

305
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,960
Honey, I don't think you should say it.

306
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,279
You've graduated and have been working for a while now.

307
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,039
It's time to think about starting a family.

308
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,759
Or are you two

309
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,519
in a relationship?

310
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,720
Honey!

311
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
Don't you want to know?

312
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,519
You've been nagging me about it all day.

313
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,599
Pierce is here now.

314
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,200
You can ask him yourself.

315
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,440
So what's going on?

316
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,680
Do you like Typhoon?

317
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,240
Can you tell me?

318
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,559
Don't pester him with questions.

319
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,400
He'll let us know when he's ready.

320
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,279
Let's talk about this later.

321
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,079
Excuse me.

322
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,359
Did I upset Typhoon?

323
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,240
I'm sorry.

324
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:24,880
You didn't, Mom.

325
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,799
Excuse me.

326
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Calm down.

327
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,240
Jedi?

328
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,279
Special delivery.

329
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,279
Why did you buy flowers?

330
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,880
The beautiful flowers reminded me of you.

331
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,960
You're such a pain.

332
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,960
Thanks, Jedi.

333
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,400
What should I do next?

334
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,039
I don't know.

335
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,079
I'll just keep drinking.

336
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:02,680
- Okay. Cut. - Cut!

337
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,759
Cut! The door is open.

338
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,799
Get the door.

339
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:12,599
Cut.

340
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:17,279
I didn't even get to go scuba diving and see the coral reefs.

341
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,160
Keep mumbling and pacing around.

342
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,799
I can't go out to eat either.

343
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,400
I can't even leave the house.

344
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,359
There's always a problem.

345
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,319
- All right. Cut. - Cut. Get the slate.

346
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,480
Cut!

347
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,919
(Next Episode)

348
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,519
You don't want to accept the truth,

349
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,000
or are you embarrassed by us?

350
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,200
I think you have to break up with this kid now.

351
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,559
Milin.

352
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,960
I'm okay with just being close to you, Jedi.

353
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,119
Are you sure that the person who was embarrassed is Tina

354
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
and not yourself?
