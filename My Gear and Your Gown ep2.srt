These are Chemistry Olympiad papers.

How could you do this?

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,186
Don't be serious.

7
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:38,504
It was an accident.

8
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:40,453
You told me not to be serious?

9
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:43,101
You brought a girl in here
just to fool around.

Are you that excited?

12
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:50,864
You went too far.

What did I say that was wrong?

14
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:56,027
My papers are ruined
because of your sexual excitement.

I didn't do it.

What do you mean?

35
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:35,525
You were the one that pushed me.

36
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:38,054
Then I bumped into the table,
and the projector fell off.

37
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:40,448
He's lying.

38
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:43,153
He was upset with me
because I accidentally spilled some water,

39
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:44,599
so he pushed me.

40
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,812
-He's lying.
-Stop arguing.

41
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:49,824
I will invite your parents here
to discuss this.

42
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,277
Hello, Dad.

43
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:59,253
Are you on the way?

44
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:02,527
His parents are already here.

45
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:04,919
Okay.

46
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,348
Please hurry up, Dad.

47
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:10,504
Okay. I'm hanging up now.

48
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:21,492
Please don't worry about this.
We will make a fair decision.

But if Pitsarut turns out
to be the one at fault,

50
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,670

from all sports competitions...

51
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,853
...because this will be his third strike.

52
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,399
Will you be okay with that?

53
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:34,859
If Pure is at fault,

54
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,004
he deserves to be punished.

55
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:40,019
Is there other options?

58
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,800
I'll share Pure's secret
so that he gets banned from school.

59
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,506
What a good eavesdropper you are.

60
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:01,666
You overheard just a few minutes of their
conversation and want to expose him.

61
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,584
You don't have any proof.

62
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,889
Pai.

63
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:08,255
Can't you just give me
some encouragement?

64
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:11,423
I'm just telling you what I see.

65
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,451
You might turn out to be the one at fault.
Who knows?

66
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,943
No way.

67
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:20,731
I didn't do it.
I refuse to be a scapegoat.

68
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:31,711
I've figured it out.

69
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,246
I know what to do with him.

70
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:36,608
What is it?

71
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:40,622
I'll tell his mother.

72
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:46,262
Yes, I'll tell his mother.

73
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:57,543
When will you stop causing trouble?

74
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:01,543
I didn't give birth to you so that
you would become this type of person.

75
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:06,048
Go take care of your own mess.

76
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:09,175

to come here again, understand?

78
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,171
Why did your dad come this time
by the way?

79
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,541
He's not my dad.

80
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:41,900
He's my mom's new boyfriend.

81
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:46,127
Just forget about it.

82
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:48,174
She'll have a new one in no time.

83
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:52,042
Tell yourself that.

84
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:54,572
Aren't you the one
who cares about her the most?

85
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:58,495
Clear things up with Waan
as soon as you can.

86
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:00,669
Don't take the blame if you didn't do it.

87
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:02,436
Otherwise, she'll get upset again.

88
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:36,627
I already talked to your parents.

89
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,238
I have their full permission
to impose a punishment...

90
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:41,268
...if either of you is wrong.

91
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:43,651
So,

92
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:47,193
I'll give you one more chance to confess.

93
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:53,219
Does anyone have anything to say?

94
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:00,822
Don't think that
I won't be able to find out?

95
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,591
I did it.

96
00:08:09,182 --> 00:08:11,221
I broke the projector.

97
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:42,446
I see you won't give in.

98
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,941
You won't stop?

99
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,142
Get this.

100
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:54,581
Guys, make sure
you don't throw it at big boss Waan.

101
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:55,910
If he gets upset,

102
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,751
he'll push you, break stuff,
and then deny it.

103
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,301
I'm the winner.

104
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:33,736
Gosh.

105
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:37,006
It's so dry. It's like I'm chewing grass.

106
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,066
You're the one who wanted
to eat this bread.

107
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,734
If you can't eat it, do you want to go
to the cafeteria then?

108
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:47,620
No, I'm tired of being teased.

109
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:50,014
You told me that Pure did it.

110
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:51,621
I don't know why you needed
to act like a hero.

111
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:52,941
Darn.

112
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:55,222
Anyway, let's forget it.
I'm not serious about it.

113
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:56,288
Witsanu.

114
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:57,441
Pantoon.

115
00:09:57,854 --> 00:09:59,615
I have something to discuss
with both of you.

116
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,541
Yes.

117
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:12,398
But it has nothing to do with him.

118
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,387
Why do you want him here?

119
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:18,034
He's the President of Bishop Club.

120
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:20,925
A club member did something wrong.
He has to be informed.

121
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:24,838
Does it mean
you will separate them from us?

122
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:28,437
I will disband Bishop Club.

123
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:31,023
You can't do that.

124
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:34,124
What about the agreement to gain
achievements within three months?

125
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:37,717
-Also, we've already prepared so much.
-Witsanu.

126
00:10:38,498 --> 00:10:39,869
Listen to me.

127
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:45,231
I will disband Bishop Club
if you don't agree with my proposition.

128
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,011
Pantoon, you have to tutor Ittikorn.

129
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:01,061
Pai will tutor Itt?

130
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:04,930
But it's my fault.

131
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:07,937
Do you mean it's your fault
that you lied?

132
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:15,741
Of course, I know.

133
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:20,720
But I will let you off
if Pantoon agrees to do what I just said.

134
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,275
Why me?

135
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,803
You're the smartest student
in the school.

136
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:32,246
Why can't you help the one
who's struggling the most?

137
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,895
Maybe...

138
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:37,013
Look,

139
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:41,686
if you can tutor Ittikorn
until he can get into a university,

140
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:45,209
I promise I'll give what Bishop Club
wants the most.

141
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:51,215
But I...

142
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,877
Come on.

143
00:11:52,957 --> 00:11:55,220
At least, he helped you before.

144
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,579
Besides, we'll get our room back.

145
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:03,357
This might be the only chance
I get to repay him.

146
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:09,622
I'll do it.

147
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:18,406
No, I'd rather die
than have tutoring sessions with him.

148
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:23,515
If you insist on that,

149
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:26,273
I'll have to ask you to move out.

150
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:28,517
Why are you threatening me about the room?

151
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:31,499
Isn't Waan the one who did it?

152
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:34,451
Then why am I being punished?

153
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:38,061
You're not being rational.
I'm going to talk to the Principal.

154
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,661
Itt.

155
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:54,175
Itt.

156
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:55,596
Itt.

157
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:56,979
Itt.

158
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,701
I'm sorry.

159
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:06,896
It was me who broke the projector.

160
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:11,264
You can tell the Principal
that our club is not part of this.

161
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:15,142
I'll take responsibility.

162
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:33,844
From today onwards, Bishop Club
and Knight Club will share this room...

163
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:36,036
...with no arguments.

164
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,694
And you, Ittikorn, need to...

165
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:42,145
...be tutored by Pantoon every Saturday
for two months until the exam.

166
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,865
If either of you disobey my instructions,
you will be kicked out.

167
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,581
Okay.

168
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:51,742
Okay.

169
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:55,821
So, you're going to do this?

170
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:59,117
-Yes, I'll do that.
-Yes.

171
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:54,781
No one likes being forced to do things
they don't want to.

172
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:02,342
But I'm not mad at the teacher
for forcing me to tutor him.

173
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:29,909
Maybe, I am hoping that
the villain will change his mind...

174
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:33,982
...and become the hero once again.

175
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:07,287
Let's get started already.

176
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:12,167
Before we start, can I ask you a question?

177
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,581
Yes.

178
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:17,896
You really don't remember helping me?

179
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,563
Who wouldn't remember someone
they've helped?

180
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:32,892
Come on. Let's start.

181
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:34,582
Okay, time for math.

00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:42,061
(Noppakhun Hospital)

183
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,192
Yes, Dad.

184
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,643
Yes, I'm here.

185
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:51,150
Yes, I'm about to go upstairs.

186
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,672
-Mom.
-Oh, Itt.

187
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:41,503
You're always like this.

188
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,341
That's close enough.

189
00:18:58,421 --> 00:18:59,849
Okay.

190
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:02,135
Let me lock the wheels.

191
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:06,004
All done.

192
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:08,094
How are you?

193
00:19:08,174 --> 00:19:09,447
I'm doing great.

194
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:10,907
How are you doing today, Mom?

195
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:12,253
I'm doing okay.

196
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,387
I prepared a meal for you today.

197
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:18,061
Here you go.

198
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:21,176
A healthy chicken breast sandwich.

199
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:27,861
You shouldn't have troubled yourself.

200
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:32,931
Well, you're probably right.

201
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:35,888
How about tomorrow
you have the hospital food instead?

202
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:40,820
Well. What's wrong with it?

203
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,151
No matter how bland or salty
the food is, I can still eat it.

204
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:47,767
When you say it like that,

205
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:50,637
I couldn't help but want
to cook something tasty for you.

206
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:54,354
Come here.

207
00:19:55,938 --> 00:20:00,058
I'm so lucky to have you, my dutiful son.

208
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:02,024
-Give me a hug.
-Of course.

209
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:05,614
How can I not love you?

210
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:07,912
Come on.

211
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:11,355
All right.

212
00:20:11,435 --> 00:20:13,719
-It's packed tight.
-Wow.

213
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,250
I don't see yours.

214
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,223
Let me prepare yours first.

215
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:20,584
-You're such a...
-Here you go.

216
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,811
I picked the best vegetables for you.

217
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,755
-Right.
-They are good for your health.

218
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:29,320
-Thank you. Wait, yours is so small.
-Here.

219
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,154
No, this is enough for me.

220
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:33,725
I want you to eat more. It's good for you.

221
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:35,191
All right. Let's eat.

222
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:45,300
Eat up.

223
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:55,149
Do you want me to study your work
at the hospital?

224
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:56,449
Isn't it too early?

225
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,262
There's nothing wrong with that.

226
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:02,981
You can prepare yourself.

227
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,362
Since you're going to be
a doctor here anyway.

228
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:12,274
Coming here frequently
might motivate you in your studies.

229
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:16,551
Okay.

230
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:25,259
Doctor, it's time for your meeting.

231
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:27,085
All right.

232
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:31,744
I told everyone here about you.

233
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,367
Just do your best.

234
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:36,374
Okay?

235
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:39,584
Okay.

236
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:41,689
Let's get going.

237
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:21,862
(Patient Room 1206)

238
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:23,061
(Utumpon Noppanaradon)

239
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,381
Are you hot?

240
00:22:24,982 --> 00:22:26,101
No, I'm good.

241
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:35,341
Kai...

242
00:22:38,662 --> 00:22:40,436
Did you come here together?

243
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,251
She wanted to visit you.
So we came here together.

244
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:47,890
Right.

245
00:22:48,582 --> 00:22:52,591
Lucky you and my friend
work at the same place.

246
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:03,510
How are you doing?

247
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:05,942
I'm doing well.

248
00:23:07,728 --> 00:23:11,182
Seeing you again reminds me
of our first year of high school.

249
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:22,251
Sorry.

250
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,238
I think my mom should rest.

251
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:29,372
I'll be fine.

252
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,745
My friend came to visit.
Let me chat with her first.

253
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:37,694
It's all right.

254
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:40,177
How about I come back some other time?

255
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:45,320
All right.

256
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:12,967
I'm going to get a drink.

257
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:29,152
Are you all right?

258
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:35,423
I'm all right. I just need a little rest.

259
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:43,657
Anyway.

260
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:48,357
Seeing my childhood friend again,
I feel like...

261
00:24:48,437 --> 00:24:51,277
...I'm a kid again.

262
00:24:54,716 --> 00:24:55,660
Itt.

263
00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:59,610
Have you ever heard the saying,

264
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:03,662
your best friends are the ones
you found in high school?

265
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:07,915
You're in grade 12 now.

266
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,692
Do you have any friends at school?

267
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,890
Try to make a lot of friends.

268
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:26,096
If only good friends
were as easy to find as you think.

269
00:25:35,588 --> 00:25:37,107
You should rest.

270
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:54,693
Thank you.

271
00:26:22,222 --> 00:26:25,462
I understand
that this must be hard for you.

272
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,248
I just need time.

273
00:26:29,842 --> 00:26:31,115
All right?

274
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:33,064
Just hang on.

275
00:26:51,262 --> 00:26:55,494
You can do whatever
with whoever you want, I don't care.

276
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:59,702
But you and your mistress should at least
show my mother some respect.

277
00:27:01,581 --> 00:27:03,727
Kai knows her place.

278
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,555
Don't make a big thing out of this.

279
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:07,961
Her place?

280
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:10,844
Then where is the place for Mom and me?

281
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:18,422
I'm begging you.

282
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:20,488
Don't bring her here again.

283
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,455
I don't want Mom to look like a fool,

284
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:25,997
praising this phony friendship of hers.

285
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:53,301
You heard that, didn't you?

286
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:57,781
Yes.

287
00:27:58,662 --> 00:28:01,126
Don't tell anyone about it.

288
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,136
Otherwise, you're dead.

289
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:08,200
If you don't want me to tell anyone,

290
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:10,942
keep up your end of the deal
with Ms Walailak.

291
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:15,648
Having you tutoring me?

292
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:17,664
Why do you even care?

293
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:21,498
I can tell her that you did your part.

294
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:23,613
And if I fail an exam,

295
00:28:24,222 --> 00:28:26,691
just tell her that I'm too stupid.

296
00:28:30,462 --> 00:28:31,742
I'm going to be your tutor.

297
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:37,101
Why are you doing this?

298
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:44,435
So that you know I'm smarter than you.

299
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:48,201
If you want to be a tutor so bad,
do it with your dog.

300
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:49,508
I'm not studying with you.

301
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:51,621
Then...

302
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:54,050
What happened today...

303
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:15,141
Why does it have to be here?

304
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:18,821
You don't need to know.
Just do what you're here to do.

305
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:24,381
Why do I have to take this test?

306
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:27,622
So that I can find out
what level of math you're at,

307
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:29,431
and create the right lesson plan.

308
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,061
Lesson plan?

309
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:34,341
Just finish it.

310
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:10,942
Whoa.

311
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:12,801
Your math level...

312
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:15,341
...is very low.

313
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:17,943
-Pai, you!
-Ah, Itt!

314
00:30:18,343 --> 00:30:19,702
What are you doing?

315
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,392
I saw leaves falling.

316
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,016
So I'm getting them out of his hair.

317
00:30:32,262 --> 00:30:33,741
How do you know I'm here?

318
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:37,469
Well, I can see you from the balcony.

319
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:38,897
Anyway.

320
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:41,691
-Is he your friend?
-Yes.

321
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:43,645
Hello, I'm Pai.

322
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,300
Well, what are you two doing?

323
00:30:48,873 --> 00:30:50,468
We're studying together.

324
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:51,754
What?

325
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:55,081
You're studying? Seriously?

326
00:30:55,161 --> 00:30:56,332
Yes.

327
00:30:57,084 --> 00:31:00,793
I've never seen you read
even a single book.

328
00:31:00,873 --> 00:31:03,802
How come you're studying with him?

329
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:10,049
I made a deal with a teacher
to help him get into a university.

330
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:12,555
But I have my work cut out for me.

331
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:15,779
Because his math skills
stop at eighth grade.

332
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:17,738
What?

333
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:19,647
Then...

334
00:31:20,223 --> 00:31:23,539
...didn't you learn anything
from grades 9 to 12?

335
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,557
Then how will you pass the entrance exam?

336
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:31,804
Is there a way to sharpen his brain?

337
00:31:31,884 --> 00:31:33,355
-Mom!
-What?

338
00:31:34,312 --> 00:31:36,515
Based on his proficiency,

339
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,064
he'll need more sessions with me.

340
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:40,099
Every Saturday might not be enough.

341
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:41,605
He also has to study after school.

342
00:31:41,685 --> 00:31:43,069
No, I don't want to.

343
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:44,388
This is enough already.

344
00:31:44,468 --> 00:31:47,083
No! You have to do it.

345
00:31:48,716 --> 00:31:51,337
Pai, you can be as hard on him
as you want. I approve.

346
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:00,111
Now, let's move to my room.
It's too hot outside.

347
00:32:00,805 --> 00:32:02,091
Yes, ma'am.

348
00:32:03,177 --> 00:32:04,715
-Let's move.
-Go ahead, Itt.

349
00:32:10,945 --> 00:32:16,586
(Insert coin)

350
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:42,312
My mom isn't a teacher.
You don't have to fake being nice.

351
00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:45,101
I'm not faking it.

352
00:32:46,662 --> 00:32:49,502
It just helps things go smoothly.

353
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:52,971
Is that it?

354
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:54,541
Yes.

(Directed by Siwaj Sawatmaneekul)

356
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:22,428
Pai.

357
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:25,303
My mom wanted me to give this to you.

358
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:29,192
And she wants you to tutor me tomorrow.

359
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:30,588
