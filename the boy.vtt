You know, personally, I don't think
that all of this is necessary,

convinced that the rats

15:12.120 --> 15:13.871

15:13.960 --> 15:15.028
And Brahms, of course,

15:15.120 --> 15:16.677
he's never been
very fond of animals.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.034

very shy, you see.

I'm not sure how
it all came to this.
